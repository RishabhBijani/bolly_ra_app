1
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:41,250
Okay...

2
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:45,660
Songs?

3
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:47,910
Total Five Songs. Five.

4
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:52,160
Is it a female-orientated film?

5
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,950
No, sir. It's a complete
male-orientated film.

6
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,450
Is there a female-lead?

7
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,950
Of course.

8
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:04,120
He means is she young,
dynamic, romantic...

9
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,250
It's all there, sir.

10
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,660
Comedy?

11
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:11,410
Well, I don't like to brag but...

12
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,540
you won't stop laughing.

13
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,660
Action?

14
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:16,160
We have five villains.

15
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,120
And they are definitely not as extras.

16
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,450
You can have all the action you want.

17
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
- Sunny...
- Yes, sir.

18
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,320
We will shoot during summer...

19
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:26,580
in broad daylight.

20
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,540
Sunny Leone.

21
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:33,040
Well, you don't need to ask twice.

22
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,870
I'll create a situation...

23
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,830
you just take care of the budget.

24
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:40,410
You are on.

25
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,580
We start shooting tomorrow.

26
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,660
- Action.
- But you haven't heard the story yet.

27
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:48,660
I've been making
films for 3 generations.

28
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,750
And never heard a single script.

29
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,750
I nearly starved for
three years to finish this script...

30
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,120
Please, sir.

31
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,200
Listen sir.

32
00:03:58,450 --> 00:03:59,450
Go ahead.

33
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,160
- You mean it?
- Go on.

34
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,540
- Okay, sir.
- Go ahead...

35
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,910
So the story begins...

36
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,250
Hello, Ladies and Gentlemen...

37
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:14,620
Welcome to the National Judo
Championship 2018 North Zone finals.

38
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:18,700
The winners in their weight category...

39
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:20,750
will be recruited by the Police Force.

40
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:23,000
As a Sub-Inspector.

41
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:25,450
Allocated from the sports division.

42
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,620
Here comes my boy.

43
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,040
Before we begin today's
wrestling competition...

44
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,950
I would like to request Inspector Gill,
who also happens to be popular wrestler...

45
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,910
to address the crowd.

46
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,120
"All play and no work
makes Jack a dull boy..."

47
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:09,700
I've issued a non-bailable warrant
against whoever perceived this saying.

48
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:13,660
Because... I was recruited
on the Force through Sports.

49
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,580
Focusing on your studies is important...

50
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,450
but sports is just as crucial!

51
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:04,000
KO.

52
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,700
- Hello, sir.
- Congratulations.

53
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,120
- Bravo.
- Smile, please...

54
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:13,200
Sir, where am I getting posted?

55
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:14,330
Soon. Soon.

56
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:16,636
Sir, where am I getting posted?

57
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:17,660
Your posting.

58
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,450
You want to know your posting.

59
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:20,870
Ask your coach.

60
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,870
Sir, where am I getting posted?

61
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,080
Sir...

62
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:28,450
Here...

63
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,080
Sir, I...

64
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,370
Jai Hind, Inspector.

65
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,870
Officer-in-Charge, District Ferozpur.

66
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:40,830
Sir.

67
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,160
- Sir.
- Congratulations.

"Paaji Cool..."

73
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,330
"He's so cool."

74
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:09,910
"Lover..."

75
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:11,660
"Lover..."

76
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:25,910
"Paaji..."

77
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:30,790
"He's a classic hero..."

78
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:32,910
"and all the girls hover around him."

79
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:36,040

00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,120

00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,370
"Paaji Cool..."

82
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,500
"He's so cool."

83
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:41,620
Cut. Cut. Cut.

84
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:43,870
And now a word from our sponsors.

85
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:45,700
Five... six... seven and...

86
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,910
"He's a lover..."

87
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,040
"Lover..."

88
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:04,120
"He's a lover..."

89
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:05,540
"He is..."

90
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:06,910
"Paaji Cool..."

91
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:07,950
"Paaji..."

92
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:10,290
"Paaji Cool..."

93
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,000
"He's so cool."

94
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,950
"Paaji Cool..."

95
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:36,040
Jai Hind, sir.

96
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,120
Head Constable, Prem Lal.

97
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:42,080
Constable,
what do you think of your new Inspector?

98
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:44,080
Looking fine, sir.

99
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,080
Wait.

100
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:49,870
Now.

101
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,120
Looking okay.

102
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,370
Honestly speaking...

103
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:02,290
I've seen inspectors come
and go in my 40-years of service...

104
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:05,120
but never seen anyone
as dashing as you.

105
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,660
And you never will.

106
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:10,160
- Attention.
- Yes, sir.

107
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:12,830
Easy bro, easy.

108
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,040
Take One, Clap.

109
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,250
And Action.

110
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:17,790
Sir... slow motion, please.

111
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:18,910
Slow... Slow...

112
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:20,700
Take two, clap.

113
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:21,830
And Action.

114
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:36,040
Greetings, Mother.

115
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:38,870
Look at you, son.

116
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,000
God bless.

117
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,750
Yes.

118
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:44,080
The world's filled with cunning people.

119
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:45,750
Worse than you.

120
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:48,500
We don't need to meddle
in anyone's affair.

121
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:49,870
- Understood.
- Really?

122
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,200
But I am the Police.

123
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:54,370
The Police mean nothing,
the nonsense of the past tense.

124
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:56,580
It takes hardly a
minute to lodge a case.

125
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,200
Do you want me to resign?

126
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:01,830
No need my naive son.
Just... Mr. Patiala.

127
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Your son's just got a permanent job...

128
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:06,540
don't make plans to
go on a permanent vacation.

129
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:07,750
In excitement.

130
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:09,200
- Good one.
- Come on.

131
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,870
Your son needs your blessings.

132
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:12,950
Here you go.

133
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:16,750
You call this a blessing.

134
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:19,540
People give solid advice,
but I gave him liquid.

135
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,000
Because winter is coming...

136
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,846
and he will need time to scout
all the wine shops.

137
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:24,120
- Right, Patiala.
- Can I leave?

138
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,270
The Police job is permanent, isn't it?

139
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:27,976
Yes. All the more reason
to find a beautiful wife.

140
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,800
If I was just a guard, then I would've
ended up with someone like this.

141
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,830
Is this what you've been teaching him?

142
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,330
That reminds me...

143
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:36,950
I forgot to give him my advice.

144
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,450
Go ahead... the one with Alexander.

145
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:42,080
Try to win people's heart, son...

146
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:44,886
because even Alexander died
alone after conquering over the world.

147
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,250
Amazing, father.

148
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:48,080
I never heard such
sound advice before.

149
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,160
Another one...

150
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:52,700
The poor wait all their
life awaiting judgement.

151
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:55,790
Try to ensure that they justice on time.

152
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:57,016
Arjun Patiala is now in the house.

153
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,450
No more waiting for judgement.

154
00:10:58,660 --> 00:10:59,660
Justice will be served.

155
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:03,080
"Make a large..."

156
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:05,700
"Make a large peg for me..."

157
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:07,580
"Be my..."

158
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:13,120
"Be my sweetheart... forever."

159
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:18,040
"And I'll celebrate... like
it's Diwali."

160
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,500
"Take a good look at me,
and my efforts."

161
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:23,000
♪♪♪

162
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,450
"I am naive and my
intentions are clear."

163
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,910
"I've been waiting for ages."

164
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,200
"Make a large..."

165
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,370
- Bro...
- Yes.

166
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,370
She is fully ripe.
Should we grab her?

167
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,700
My thoughts exactly.

168
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:40,120
But you see...

169
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,540
I can't drink on the rocks.

170
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:42,790
How about we add some water?

171
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:43,870
Go ahead.

172
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,290
- What happened?
- He poured water on me.

173
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,330
That was fun.

174
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:01,290
Enough, sir.

175
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:15,870
Your ration, sir.

176
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:19,869
We've been robbed.
We've been robbed. Police. Police.

177
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:22,250
Sonny boy, he is the Police.

178
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:23,500
Don't call him back.

179
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,750
Gunnu, what's the rate of your chicken?

180
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,580
110 rupees a kilo?

181
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:32,870
Really? Is it really that cheap?

182
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,620
Are you going to pay?

183
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,160
Of course... not!

184
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,450
You misunderstand.

185
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,540
Can't a guy even ask?

186
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:52,660
Not the door again.

187
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,910
Here's your early bird...

188
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,500
Will it be sautÃ©ed or with gravy?

189
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:58,620
Make whatever you like...

190
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,580
just make it lavish.

191
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,500
- I think you got extra this time.
- Okay, sir.

192
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,200
The Police always get a little extra.

193
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:05,450
The new inspector is arriving today.

194
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:06,766
Tell me something I don't know.

195
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:08,450
I've seen inspectors come and go.

196
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,290
What do we do with her?

197
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:12,450
Kamraj sir,
I don't care who the Inspector is...

198
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,410
but Onidda's buffalo
is staying right here.

199
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,500
- Yes.
- Right, Victoria.

200
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,290
She is a lucky buffalo.

201
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:29,750
Jai Hind, sir.

202
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:30,750
They are HK.

203
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:31,580
HK?

204
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:32,700
Haram Khor.(RASCALS)

205
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:33,580
Yes, sir.

206
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:36,160
Tie 3.2-kilo bricks around their neck.

207
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:38,160
- And make them clean the place.
- Yes.

208
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,160
Introduce yourselves.

209
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:01,370
She is one of us.

210
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,500
Victoria.

211
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:04,290
And you are...

212
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,410
Your head constable, Onidda Singh.

213
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:07,910
Onidda?

214
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,950
You see, my three older sisters
and my mother wanted a TV set.

215
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,830
And back then Onidda was
the most recent television set.

216
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,330
Mother used to stitch
clothes for a living...

217
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:21,040
and saved the money in a piggy bank.

218
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,266
We were only 400 rupees away
from buying a brand new tv set.

219
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:24,830
But my father was unemployed.

220
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:26,120
And completely useless.

221
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:29,580
One day he broke the piggybank
and splurged all the money on booze.

222
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:34,620
That same night my older sisters
went over to my uncle's place.

223
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:37,750
Dad was drunk and couldn't
control his feelings...

224
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:41,200
and they had me instead of a TV.

225
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:45,040
And mother named me
Onidda after her favorite TV.

226
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:46,500
Very sad story

227
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:49,040
but there was no
need for an explanation.

228
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:51,290
Now show me around.

229
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:52,540
Follow me, sir.

230
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,450
These are our guests, sir.

231
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:57,410
Junkies, alcoholics, thieves...
BC.

232
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,870
Beg your pardon, sir.

233
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,540
Bad Characters.

234
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:02,410
- Where is my room?
- Upstairs.

235
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:03,540
- Let's go.
- Come on.

236
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,790
Your personal computer, sir.

237
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:25,660
Yes, my personal computer.

238
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:27,370
Do you know how to use it?

239
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:29,450
- Like the back of my hand.
- Come on.

240
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:32,830
- Sir, just turn that switch on.
- Yes...

241
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,540
Hello.

242
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:35,950
Get up.

243
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:39,500
Sorry.

244
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:42,700
Turn the switch on...
I'll turn you own.

245
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,540
Don't you know how to, sir?

246
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:46,660
Of course, I do.

247
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:48,910
The Boss only press "Enter".

248
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,620
Like this.

249
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,870
What else do we have in our area?

250
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,660
It's a very small area, sir.

251
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,080
There are 5 banks.

252
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,450
Those 5 banks have 15 ATMs.

253
00:15:58,580 --> 00:15:59,370
10 restaurants...

254
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:02,170
out of which 3 serve vegetarian
and the rest serve non-vegetarian.

255
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,200
How many wine shops?

256
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,160
Four.

257
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:09,660
And three out of them
are government approved.

258
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:13,200
How many illegal?

259
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:17,120
I think sir is weak in maths too.

260
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,160
Oh, no.

261
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:38,000
I think she is in some kind of trouble.

262
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,120
Yes.

263
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,540
Then she is the
government's responsibility.

264
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:43,080
Call her up...

265
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:44,750
And another thing...

266
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,120
Breathe out.

267
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:05,830
I rented out my shop to some people.

268
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:07,120
In New Market.

269
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:10,910
- And we also had an agreement.
- "Just like one needs to breathe..."

270
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,500
- We had an 11-month agreement.
- "Just like one needs to breathe..."

271
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,450
- "...to stay alive..."
- I even put up a board there.

272
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:20,250
But they are refusing to leave.

273
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:25,290
- The agreement is over, they should leave.
- "All I need a sweetheart to fall in love."

274
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:27,580
Please tell me... can you help?

275
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:28,870
Please...

276
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:34,540
♪♪♪

277
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,200
Please tell me... can you help?

278
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,540
Madam, can you please repeat.

279
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:48,160
Yes.
I have a shop in New Market.

280
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:50,330
And I let some people
rent it 14-months ago.

281
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:53,540
I see...
We had an 11-month agreement.

282
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,790
The agreement's over,
and so is my course.

283
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:56,870
Ohh...

284
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,870
What course.

285
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:00,950
I was doing a beautician course
to start my own beauty parlour.

286
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:03,910
That's exactly what I
was planning to do... in my shop.

287
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,000
But they are refusing to leave.

288
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,410
They say that I should
file a case instead.

289
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,870
There won't be any court cases.

290
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:12,330
Only justice.

291
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,910
Myself, Arjun Patiala.

292
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,160
Baby Narula.

293
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:18,160
- Nice to meet you, Arjun.
- Same here.

294
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:19,750
Sir.

295
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,500
- Onidda Singh.
- Hello.

296
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,700
Hello.

297
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:25,870
Baby, your number.

298
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:32,160
9211... 84... 86... 88...

299
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:35,580
Okay, see you.

300
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:36,450
Huh?

301
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:37,250
See you.

302
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:38,410
Okay.

303
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:40,080
- See you later.
- Definitely.

304
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:44,700
Don't you think you were too direct?

305
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,120
Where is my tea?

306
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:49,580
What about them, sir?

307
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:52,670
You said tie bricks around the neck
and make the clean the Police Station.

308
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,450
3.2 Kg...

309
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:06,540
Healthy Baby weight.

310
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:08,450
When it's time for delivery.

311
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:11,370
I am sure you two weighed the same.

312
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:13,870
Tired already?

313
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,380
But I am sure your
mothers didn't get tired.

314
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,080
They bore you two for 9-months.

315
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:23,750
You should have thought of her and
dropped the idea of teasing that girl.

316
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:26,540
Women should be respected...

317
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,700
they are not some object.

318
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:33,000
Look wise guy,
even I have a heart...

319
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:34,870
I am vigorous.

320
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,080
Be polite with her.

321
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:39,620
But if she ignores,
then stop right there.

322
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,450
Sorry, sir... Sorry, sir...

323
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:45,790
When you really feel
ashamed of what you've done...

324
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,800
then you can take those bricks
off and go back home to your mothers.

325
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:51,290
Sir...

326
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:56,910
Straight from the heart.

327
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:05,950
Get out.

328
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:08,540
Hurry up. Quickly. Now!

329
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:11,870
- But I have an agreement.
- Those sir's orders.

330
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,580
Get out now, now...

331
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:25,950
And now, sir...

332
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:29,040
for absolutely no reason.

333
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:31,330
Item Number.

334
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:49,620
"She parties all night..."

335
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,200
"parties all night."

336
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:53,950
"She parties all night..."

337
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:58,450
"She parties all night..."

338
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:00,500
"Looks like a hottie."

339
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:03,290
"She parties all night..."

340
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:05,000
"Looks like a hottie."

341
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,200
"She breaks hearts..."

342
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:09,580
"She breaks every decent guy's heart."

343
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:13,910
"Makes them spend all their money on her."

344
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:17,000
"O, my sweetheart..."

345
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,700
"stole heart."

346
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:21,620
"My beloved..."

347
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,160
"robbed me clean."

348
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:26,120
"O, my sweetheart..."

349
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,750
"stole heart."

350
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:30,700
"My beloved..."

351
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:33,000
"robbed me clean."

352
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,120
"Hair like gold dust..."

353
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:46,000
"but heart like a stone."

354
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:48,500
"Tasty like sweet porridge..."

355
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:50,910
"her beauty pierces my heart."

356
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:52,870
"Hair like gold dust..."

357
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:55,250
"but heart like a stone."

358
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:57,580
"Tasty like sweet porridge..."

359
00:21:57,870 --> 00:21:59,750
"her beauty pierces my heart."

360
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:02,000
"O, my sweetheart..."

361
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:07,160
"My beloved..."

362
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,160
"She breaks every decent guy's heart."

363
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:13,500
"She spends faster you can think."

364
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,790
"She breaks every decent guy's heart."

365
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:17,950
"Makes them spend all their money on her."

366
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,910
"O, my sweetheart..."

367
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,580
"stole heart."

368
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:25,540
"My beloved..."

369
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,080
"robbed me clean."

370
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:35,160
"O, my sweetheart..."

371
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:43,200
"My beloved..."

372
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,200
Careful. Careful.

373
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:57,620
Seems like a busy day.

374
00:22:57,870 --> 00:23:01,950
Mr. Chopra,
meet our new station in-charge.

375
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:02,910
Arjun Patiala.

376
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,500
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

377
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:06,346
Can I interest you in
something for sister-in-law?

378
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:08,160
You seem to be in a lot of hurry.

379
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:09,660
He's still single.

380
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:10,870
See you.

381
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:18,870
Sir...

382
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:20,950
Bonus.

383
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:24,620
Can I pack a pair for sister-in-law?

384
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,750
Even you seem to be in a hurry.

385
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:28,870
He's still single. Understand.

386
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:50,750
Make the next one spicier.

387
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:53,700
Madam, what's the time?

388
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:58,040
Only a minute before you get a slap.

389
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,200
Let's go.

390
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,410
Did they comment on you?

391
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:17,660
What?

392
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:26,790
This is serious?

393
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:30,410
Are you feeling okay?

394
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:34,500
I noticed that those boys
were passing comments on you.

395
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,700
- You can always tell me...
- Yes...

396
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:39,200
Because I am very short-tempered.

397
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:44,040
Our boss is always is first to
arrive wherever there's trouble.

398
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:47,000
Our new station in-charge.

399
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,330
Unbelievable, sister.

400
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:52,160
Since when did the Police
start recruiting handsome men?

401
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:54,250
Myself Sub-Inspector Arjun Patiala.

402
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:55,910
National Level Judo Champion.

403
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:58,870
With you... For you... Always.

404
00:24:59,200 --> 00:24:59,910
Huh...

405
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,870
It's our slogan.

406
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:03,330
It's written on our car as well.

407
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,040
Okay.

408
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:08,200
Myself, Ritu Randhawa.

409
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:09,410
Faster than lightning.

410
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:11,950
I am a journalist.

411
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,540
You see... even our slogan's
printed on our vehicle.

412
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:17,700
I see...

413
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:21,500
What's the hurry, Inspector?

414
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:22,870
You can have my number later.

415
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,500
No... SSP sir is calling.

416
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:27,200
- I see...
- Answer it.

417
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:28,700
Yes... Of course.

418
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,040
Jai Hind, sir.

419
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:32,450
I can see...

420
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:36,160
- It's ringing.
- I won't spare them.

421
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,290
I mean your phone's ringing.

422
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:42,080
Look at this.
SSP sir is calling again on my number.

423
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,250
Can't imagine the urgency...

424
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:47,540
Jai Hind, sir.

425
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:49,080
Hold on, sir...

426
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:51,410
You seem to be on an important call.

427
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:53,330
So... it's goodbye from me.

428
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:54,450
Okay.

429
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:56,870
- Okay...
- Okay... That was too soon.

430
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:08,370
Sir, I think we'll have to revisit
the jeweller and shoe shop pretty soon.

431
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:16,370
Anything else, sir.

432
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,040
What can be better than her?

433
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:28,500
"Just like one needs to breathe..."

434
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:30,790
- "...to stay alive..."
- Onidda...

435
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:33,830
have you ever been in love?

436
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:38,000
I mean did your heart
ever beat for anyone.

437
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:43,290
That was rude.

438
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,000
This is all your fault, sir.

439
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:47,790
You struck a raw nerve.

440
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:51,250
I've been in love
more than a dozen times.

441
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:57,950
Well...

442
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:01,620
My heart's like the
red signal on the street.

443
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:04,040
Everyone breaks it.

444
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:08,410
Do you know why I go to weddings?

445
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:11,750
So that the groom's father
will ask for more dowry...

446
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:13,846
and the bride's family
will come up to me and say...

447
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:17,290
"Only you can save our honour."

448
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:19,540
Imagine my plight...

449
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:24,200
whenever I make a call,
it's always a guy who answers my call.

450
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:27,410
Hello. Hello. Hello...

451
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:30,870
I think for me finding a
girl is as difficult as...

452
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:34,540
getting the witness
to court safe and sound in old movies.

453
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:37,410
That was a very sad story.

454
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,250
But there was no
need for an explanation.

455
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,580
I have an advice for you.

456
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:46,200
Don't stop going to weddings
and don't stop calling.

457
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:49,290
Who knows when your
prayers will be heard...

458
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,370
like my has been.

459
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:57,910
Sir... that reminds me,
the DSP is arriving in the morning.

460
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,080
DSP who?

461
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,500
DSP Gill.

462
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:02,790
No one's above me, Onidda.

463
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:05,700
Sir, I think you're high.

464
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:07,700
I am in love, silly.

465
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:09,950
We'll find out in the morning.

466
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:17,750
- Maintain one arm distance.
- Yes... Yes...

467
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:20,450
Sir, I am sorry about last night.

468
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:21,660
- Okay.
- What for?

469
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:25,370
I got too emotional and
made you make drinks for me.

470
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:26,660
That wasn't right.

471
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:28,580
Doesn't matter.

472
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:31,080
Last night we were
just emotional and drunk.

473
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:32,620
Not Inspector and Constable.

474
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:37,700
But, sir, who was emotional
and who was drunk?

475
00:28:57,410 --> 00:28:59,540
Smartalec...
We already put that up once.

476
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:00,726
How many times are
you going to put that up?

477
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:02,620
- Take it out.
- Oh yes, sorry, sir.

478
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:07,620
Relax.

479
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:10,700
- SI Arjun Patiala.
- Yes, sir.

480
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:13,490
- How was your experience in this area?
- It was fine.

481
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:14,980
He has been extremely productive.

482
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:19,950
He's the constable, sir.

483
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:25,160
Look Patiala,
maintain peace and order in the area.

484
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:26,120
Yes, sir.

485
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:26,910
Come.

486
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:28,250
Relax.

487
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:30,370
Come.

488
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:35,370
Bring some tea.

489
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:40,000
When I was younger,
I thought I could change the world.

490
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:48,200
But as I grew up, I realised it takes
almost a lifetime to understand this world.

491
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:55,370
Now I have only one
dream Crime Free District.

492
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:57,910
My father had only one dream...

493
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:00,040
To see me as a Police Officer.

494
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:02,980
And you deserve all the credit
for making his dream come true.

495
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:05,660
Good, Patiala.

496
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,750
Your parent's dreams came true.

497
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:11,410
And now it's time to
fulfil my idol's dream.

498
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:14,700
You want a crime-free district,
then consider it done.

499
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,790
It's easier said than done, Patiala.

500
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:19,790
Many years ago,
I was exactly where you are...

501
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:23,370
and my senior gave me this same advice.

502
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,940
It's easier said than done, Patiala.

503
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,620
Maybe, but it's not impossible.

504
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:29,330
Don't worry.

505
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:31,700
The Police won't have to work hard...

506
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:35,950
but your dreams of a crime
free district shall soon be fulfilled.

507
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,000
What happened to you?

508
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,910
I was at the tender opening venue.

509
00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:51,000
And a fight broke out.

510
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:53,750
I tried to break the
fight but they attacked me.

511
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,580
And said that I only break the law...

512
00:30:56,910 --> 00:30:59,910
and don't remember them.

513
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,160
It's okay, sir.
I'll take him to the doctor.

514
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:03,910
Come.

515
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Wait.

516
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,290
Done. Done. Done.

517
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,540
- Mic.
- Hold the mic higher.

518
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:12,660
Higher.

519
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:14,330
Higher.

520
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:16,346
Do you want me to shove it up my nose?
Is this okay?

521
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:17,200
Yes.

522
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:18,370
Come on.

523
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:21,580
As always,
the mighty are calling the shots...

524
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:24,080
and the Police are helpless.

525
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,870
And my cameraman has forgotten
to turn on the camera...

526
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:27,990
and I am tired of this.

527
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,476
Because someone must be standing
behind me, like they always do.

528
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,040
Who is this idiot? Get lost.

529
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,160
Rolling...

530
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,330
As always,
the mighty are calling the shots...

531
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:37,620
and the Police are helpless.

532
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:41,040
And as you can see,
Baldev Singh Rana and his henchmen...

533
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,870
are waiting for
the tender announcement.

534
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:45,630
And his terror has reached such
a level that even in broad daylight.

535
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:53,120
Boss... he's the new station in-charge.

536
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:01,580
Come along.

537
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,160
Since when did the Police
start recruiting kids?

538
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,500
So...

539
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:14,120
who attacked the Police?

540
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:21,450
Sonny...

541
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:26,330
this cat and mouse
game is filled with risk.

542
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:28,370
You look like a good boy.

543
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:35,370
And good boys become Doctors,
Engineers, MBA...

544
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:48,910
KO...

545
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,120
You are absolutely right.

546
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,700
Good boys become doctors and engineers.

547
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,870
And do you know what bad boys become?

548
00:32:58,250 --> 00:32:59,410
Police...

549
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
To keep the good boys safe.

550
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:06,660
He is still breathing.

551
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:09,500
Put him in the back of the jeep.

552
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,290
But don't report him yet.

553
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:13,080
This conversation isn't over yet.

554
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:14,660
The guy has got guts.

555
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:16,080
Didn't seem like it.

556
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:17,290
Roll.

557
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:20,660
The Police has taken Baldev
Singh out of the equation...

558
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:23,590
- before he could cause trouble at the venue.
- Onidda, we are late.

559
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:26,410
Whether Baldev Rana wake up or not...

560
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,700
but the government
has finally woken up.

561
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:30,790
This is Ritu Randhawa,
with Cameraman Yash.

562
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:31,700
Tezz News.

563
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:33,000
Got it. Let's pack.

564
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,080
- Come on, wind up, wind up.
- Okay yeah.

565
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:42,160
Oh my, God. Oh my, God. Oh my, God.
What a surprise?

566
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:43,750
It's you.

567
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:45,370
By the way, I was looking for you.

568
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:46,200
I can see that.

569
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:48,790
But it seemed like you were
looking in the wrong direction.

570
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:49,910
I was here all the time.

571
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:51,290
I am so sorry.

572
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:53,050
Doesn't mind.
It's pretty common with you.

573
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,280
Sir, can I interest you
in something for sister-in-law?

574
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:01,330
How cute.

575
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:04,450
You will have your chance.

576
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:06,500
- You should keep more red bangles.
- Yes.

577
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:08,080
You are a big dreamer.

578
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:10,330
I have very big dreams.

579
00:34:10,410 --> 00:34:11,730
One should have dreams, you know.

580
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:12,790
They come true.

581
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:16,790
- Then my dreams will come true too.
- Of course.

582
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,370
What is your dream?

583
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:20,270
- Do you really want to know?
- Yes.

584
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:25,370
A young, handsome, dynamic officer,

585
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:31,120
who floored a 6'4
guy like a bag of wool...

586
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:34,450
Interview.

587
00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:37,330
Interview.

588
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:38,700
Is it possible?

589
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Of course.

590
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:43,450
But an interview sounds really boring.

591
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,200
How about a conversation?

592
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,870
How did you decide to take
action against the contract mafia?

593
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:54,910
You see, they grabbed
one of our policemen and...

594
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:55,950
And?

595
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:59,000
And said that we are
not scared of the Police.

596
00:34:59,290 --> 00:34:59,660
Okay.

597
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:01,270
So I gave them a reason to fear us.

598
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:03,000
I like your attitude.

599
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:06,120
So which crime are
you going to target next?

600
00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:08,926
Well... just like a mother never
distinguishes among her children...

601
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:11,120
same with the Police.

602
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:13,010
We will treat all
of them in the same way.

603
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,120
Like a mother...

604
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:16,000
Yes...

605
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:19,370
And a crime-free district
is my DSP sir's dream.

606
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:22,040
And... we...

607
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:24,450
I mean we will fulfil their dream.

608
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:25,870
Like a mother...

609
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:30,040
Crime free district is just not yours,
but our dream also.

610
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,120
That was sub-Inspector Arjun Patiala.

611
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:34,160
With you... For you... Always.

612
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:36,690
- Correct.
- You forgot something.

613
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:37,290
What?

614
00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:40,000
Ritu Randhawa, faster than...
Ohh...

615
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:42,290
This is Ritu Randhawa,
faster than lightning.

616
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,830
Faster than lightning.

617
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:45,950
That's what counts.

618
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,160
So its a goodbye.

619
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:51,450
When can we meet again, Ritu?

620
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:54,830
Keep... catching bad guys,
and we'll keep meeting.

621
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,120
Okay, fine,

622
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,620
What am I hearing, Onidda?

623
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:06,160
Are the Lawyers here?

624
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:09,120
They have, sir.
And they are already leaving.

625
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:10,660
There are your lawyers...

626
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,000
getting Baldev Rana out on bail.

627
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:17,080
If this continues, then we'll
have to let all the bad guys go.

628
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:22,040
No, Onidda. That's what they think.

629
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:23,040
Come on.

630
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:26,500
Actually, tell me about
all the criminals in our area.

631
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:30,450
Veterans, seasoned and amateurs.

632
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:31,660
Meaning?

633
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:36,000
Meaning International league,
IPL league, and Local ones.

634
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,200
- Ohh... I get it.
- Come on.

635
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:40,750
But sir, if I do all the job...

636
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:42,870
then what is sister-in-law for?

637
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:45,080
In the end, it's all
about loving your family.

638
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:47,910
- Is it?
- Yes.

639
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:50,580
Who gets married at the age of 31?

640
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,750
What 35?
You don't remember my birthday.

641
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,120
Sir, may I come in?

642
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:58,540
I don't care if everyone
likes my picture.

643
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:03,620
So sorry, but you know my mother...

644
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:06,120
By the way, what is your opinion?

645
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:10,580
Should I get married?

646
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,346
Did you call me for my opinion?

647
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:17,370
Your interview of SI Arjun...

648
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:19,830
Great coverage. Great rating.

649
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:20,950
Thank you, sir.

650
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,040
Anything else.

651
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,160
My feelings...

652
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:25,370
You know what I feel about Bhavna.

653
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,750
She has no focus on her work.

654
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,766
Her performance is
really bad this quarter.

655
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:31,226
Don't worry, sir.
I'll talk to her right now.

656
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:32,290
- Yes...
- Ritu.

657
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,660
Mom is making something special tonight.

658
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:39,790
I was thinking of throwing a small
get-together with the office colleagues.

659
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,120
Who else is coming, sir?

660
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:43,370
My mom...

661
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:44,950
Me of course.

662
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:48,290
And you...

663
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:52,200
Sir, I think you should get married.

664
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:53,950
And don't forget to invite me.

665
00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:55,770
I'll get to meet your mother as well.

666
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:57,620
Okay.

667
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:01,330
The Police are not worth being trusted...

668
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,870
but I am trusting you.

669
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:04,500
Don't break it.

670
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:06,190
This is three years of my hard work.

671
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:08,660
A database of all the main
criminals in this district.

672
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,790
Villain no. 1; Baldev Singh Rana...

673
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,580
The guy you recently knocked out.

674
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:17,290
First got addicted to drugs.

675
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:20,040
Then he made a business out of it.

676
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,700
And now he supplies
drugs all over the world.

677
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:27,250
Moving ahead... Dilbaug Singh.

678
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:30,580
If Baldev Singh Rana
is the king of spades...

679
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:32,346
then Dilbaug is the king of hearts.

680
00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:33,580
Dilbaug Singh is in jail...

681
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:35,910
but he's calling the
shots from behind the bars.

682
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:39,410
The uncrowned king of crime...

683
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Dilbaug Singh.

684
00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:49,450
He's refusing.

685
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:50,950
Hello...

686
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:52,410
Yes?

687
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:53,450
One second.

688
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,160
If he's refusing, then just shoot him.

689
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,660
Yes... Not, you just...

690
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:02,950
Did you shoot him?

691
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,660
Huh... did you shoot...

692
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:06,000
You shot him too.

693
00:39:06,330 --> 00:39:07,620
Have you two lost your minds?

694
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:09,300
Do you want to drive me out of business?

695
00:39:09,370 --> 00:39:10,370
Idiots.

696
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:13,450
Boss...

697
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:14,950
All okay, sir?

698
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:16,580
No...

699
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:18,410
So much pain...

700
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,700
plus no hemoglobin.

701
00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:23,450
Seriously?

702
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:25,580
And these two are sworn enemies.

703
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:27,200
To become the Alpha.

704
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,500
Any new talent.

705
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:31,290
You are the new talent on the block.

706
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:33,450
These guys are criminals.

707
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:36,370
There is a guy.

708
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:37,910
Sakool.

709
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,540
Stay back. Stay back.

710
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:41,830
Don't touch.

711
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:44,040
It's a touchscreen.
My father bought this for me.

712
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,160
Give me back my phone.
Who were you?

713
00:39:46,370 --> 00:39:47,596
You don't look like
you belong to this school.

714
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:49,160
I belong to every school and college.

715
00:39:49,290 --> 00:39:51,370
- Is this WhatsApp?
- That's Snapchat.

716
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:53,266
- The one with cat and dog emojis.
- And rabbits too.

717
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:54,370
- How about a pig?
- No.

718
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:55,660
Let me show you how.

719
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,580
You don't know me, but I do.

720
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,620
You are Mr.
Ahuja's son, who lives in Hari Nagar.

721
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,620
Is your father's number saved in it?

722
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,700
What did you save us?
Papa or daddy?

723
00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:06,580
"Od man."

724
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:08,330
You save his number as "Old man".

725
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:10,200
Let me talk to him.

726
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,200
Hello, Mr. Ahuja.

727
00:40:12,330 --> 00:40:15,330
Listen to this...
Listen carefully.

728
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:17,410
That's the apple of your eye screaming.

729
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,476
- And this is Sakool on the line.
- Papa...

730
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,370
Recognise me.

731
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,410
It's nothing serious?
Just a little cut...

732
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,120
with an icepick.

733
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,580
Return the money that you owe me.

734
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:29,750
Otherwise next time
the cut will be bigger...

735
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:32,580
and you won't be able to patch him up.

736
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:34,490
It's not that serious now.

737
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,266
Let me take a look. Be quiet.

738
00:40:36,290 --> 00:40:38,636
He will be fine with a couple
of stitches. Bring the doctor along.

739
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:43,500
You see Mr.
Ahuja, never try to cheat Sakool?

740
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:46,360
And why did you buy such
an expensive phone for your kid?

741
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,080
Can I keep it?

742
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:51,370
Even I am like your son.
We'll chat on Snapchat using emojis.

743
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,520
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.
Come on.

744
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:08,000
Sakool and his younger brother Anda.

745
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:11,370
Anda is a frequent visitor
to jail for petty cases.

746
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:13,870
And currently,
he's doing time for blackmail.

747
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:18,160
Basically, together these two
are as good as a small criminal gang.

748
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:26,750
So that's it.

749
00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:29,290
I've seen good story-tellers.

750
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:31,160
But even narrate facts so well.

751
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:32,040
Thank you.

752
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,200
Everything is clear.

753
00:41:33,370 --> 00:41:34,370
Thank God.

754
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,080
Go on, sir.

755
00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:37,290
Ritu...

756
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:40,080
You know, Mr. Kumra. ASI Kumra.

757
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,700
Her daughter is getting married.

758
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,790
I would be really pleased
if you could come over.

759
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,120
Invitation from the Police?

760
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,290
No. The bride's brother.

761
00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:55,330
You see, the bride's my neighbour
and also my childhood friend.

762
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:57,540
So I'll come on my own.

763
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,910
So Baldev Rana is in
the International League.

764
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,080
Dilbaug is in the IPL.

765
00:42:12,790 --> 00:42:14,870
And Sakool is the emerging talent.

766
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:16,700
Wonderful.

767
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,200
Sir...

768
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:21,450
how about we pay him a visit?

769
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:25,910
"O, Sweetheart..."

770
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,620
"Sweetheart."

771
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:30,750
Welcome, madam...

772
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:33,120
Welcome, madam... Please...

773
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:44,160
Madam.

774
00:42:44,370 --> 00:42:46,040
MP sir was on the line.

775
00:42:46,290 --> 00:42:49,620
He wants you to arrange for
50 million rupees for party fund.

776
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:53,160
Bhatia sir, you're such a... loser.

777
00:42:53,910 --> 00:42:57,950
Tell him that only corrupt
people give donations for party fund.

778
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:00,080
- I am a public servant.
- Yes.

779
00:43:01,330 --> 00:43:02,330
Hello.

780
00:43:02,370 --> 00:43:03,580
- Daughter-in-law.
- Yes.

781
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:07,290
The fritter stalls are on that side.
Ask them for the recipe.

782
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:08,910
Yes, mother-in-law.

783
00:43:09,370 --> 00:43:10,950
Your's don't turn out so good.

784
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:12,450
- Patiala.
- Sir.

785
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:14,290
- Come here.
- Sir.

786
00:43:14,410 --> 00:43:15,410
What took you so long?

787
00:43:15,790 --> 00:43:18,000
Actually,
on our way here, we had a couple of...

788
00:43:18,950 --> 00:43:20,040
Jolly good.

789
00:43:20,370 --> 00:43:23,660
He was taking care of some
ruffians even on his way here.

790
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:25,040
Meet Patiala.

791
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:26,450
I was telling you about him.

792
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:29,700
Let me introduce you...
She is the MLA of our area.

793
00:43:29,870 --> 00:43:30,870
Praapti Makkad.

794
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:33,540
- Oh... Property Makkar. (CHEATER)
- Hey...

795
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,330
Those are the local
boys with chalks and coal.

796
00:43:36,410 --> 00:43:37,636
And they are getting
too creative these days.

797
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:38,200
Okay.

798
00:43:38,330 --> 00:43:39,950
We'll arrest all of them, madam.

799
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,450
Good for nothing.

800
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:44,500
Very cool.

801
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:45,370
Smart.

802
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:48,250
Madam, he's a very talented officer.

803
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:52,790
He's been chasing after
bad guys since day 1 of his job.

804
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,660
- Thanks to your love and support, sir.
- That's all. Stop it.

805
00:43:55,750 --> 00:43:58,040
Continue cleaning my path...

806
00:43:58,410 --> 00:44:00,200
and even I will give you lots of love.

807
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:04,450
I mean... clear the streets.

808
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:06,120
Yes.

809
00:44:06,790 --> 00:44:08,500
Look, there is he.

810
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:10,450
Bijli se Tezz... channel's editor.

811
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:11,540
Hi sir.

812
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:28,450
"Check. Check."

813
00:44:40,870 --> 00:44:42,950
"The beauty spot on your cheek..."

814
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,250
"your attitude steals my heart."

815
00:44:45,410 --> 00:44:47,330
"My heart's in a dilemma..."

816
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:49,450
"come and see me tonight alone."

817
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:51,620
"The beauty spot on your cheeks..."

818
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:53,830
"your attitude steals my heart."

819
00:44:53,950 --> 00:44:55,950
"My heart's in a dilemma..."

820
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,950
"come and see me tonight alone."

821
00:44:58,040 --> 00:44:59,910
"My sweetheart..."

822
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:02,250
"Hear me, my love..."

823
00:45:02,370 --> 00:45:03,410
"My sweetheart..."

824
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:04,700
"Hear me, my love..."

825
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:07,540
"Why is my heart in
a condition like this?"

826
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:08,750
"Why."

827
00:45:08,950 --> 00:45:11,700
"Because I am crazy for you..."

828
00:45:11,790 --> 00:45:13,290
"Crazy for you..."

829
00:45:13,370 --> 00:45:15,000
"I am an old lover."

830
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:16,500
"Crazy for you..."

831
00:45:17,950 --> 00:45:20,450
"Because I am crazy for you..."

832
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:21,910
"Crazy for you..."

833
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:23,700
"I am an old lover."

834
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:25,410
"Crazy for you..."

835
00:45:44,370 --> 00:45:46,370
"My sweet angel..."

836
00:45:46,450 --> 00:45:48,450
"your body shines like a diamond."

837
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:50,700
"One in a million, baby girl."

838
00:45:50,870 --> 00:45:52,790
"You make my heart skip a beat."

839
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:55,160
"My sweet angel..."

840
00:45:55,290 --> 00:45:57,250
"your body shines like a diamond."

841
00:45:57,330 --> 00:45:59,330
"One in a million, baby girl."

842
00:45:59,370 --> 00:46:01,200
"You make my heart skip a beat."

843
00:46:01,330 --> 00:46:03,200
"My sweetheart..."

844
00:46:03,370 --> 00:46:05,369
"Hear me, my love..."

845
00:46:05,370 --> 00:46:06,620
"My sweetheart..."

846
00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:08,040
"Hear me, my love..."

847
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,870
"Why is my heart in
a condition like this?"

848
00:46:11,370 --> 00:46:12,120
"Why."

849
00:46:12,250 --> 00:46:15,040
"Because I am crazy for you..."

850
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:16,660
"Crazy for you..."

851
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:18,290
"I am an old lover."

852
00:46:18,370 --> 00:46:20,000
"Crazy for you..."

853
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,750
"Because I am crazy for you..."

854
00:46:23,870 --> 00:46:25,290
"Crazy for you..."

855
00:46:25,370 --> 00:46:27,040
"I am an old lover."

856
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:28,750
"Crazy for you..."

857
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:34,200
"I can even befriend the moon for you."

858
00:46:34,330 --> 00:46:38,580
"And call him in our
backyard whenever you want."

859
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:40,700
"She speaks volumes from her eyes..."

860
00:46:40,870 --> 00:46:42,950
"looks cutest among the lot,
that's my baby girl."

861
00:46:43,250 --> 00:46:45,200
"She makes me restless..."

862
00:46:45,370 --> 00:46:47,910
"grab my hand and let's go."

863
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:49,160
"Why?"

864
00:46:49,330 --> 00:46:52,160
"You're crazy about me..."

865
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:53,620
"Crazy about me."

866
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:55,330
"You're my old lover."

867
00:46:55,370 --> 00:46:57,040
"Crazy about me."

868
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,790
"Because you're crazy about me..."

869
00:47:00,910 --> 00:47:02,370
"Crazy about me."

870
00:47:02,410 --> 00:47:04,080
"You're my old lover."

871
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:05,700
"Crazy about me."

872
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:22,000
Sir... I can see your dreams
are on the verge of coming true.

873
00:47:22,370 --> 00:47:24,450
How about we start making
DSP sir's dreams come true?

874
00:47:26,370 --> 00:47:27,580
Hello, Sakool.

875
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:29,200
Come down.

876
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:30,620
Look who is here.

877
00:47:31,410 --> 00:47:34,250
Sir, every inch of
this place feels blessed.

878
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:36,040
You bake bricks too.

879
00:47:36,370 --> 00:47:38,040
I heard a lot about you.

880
00:47:38,370 --> 00:47:39,386
And feel so blessed to finally meet you.

881
00:47:39,410 --> 00:47:41,200
Greetings. Come. Please.

882
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:43,620
What would you like to have?

883
00:47:43,790 --> 00:47:46,120
Never had Tea, coffee, canned juice.

884
00:47:46,410 --> 00:47:47,410
Get some buttermilk.

885
00:47:47,870 --> 00:47:49,500
Bring two buttermilk.

886
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:52,750
Repeat.

887
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:53,620
What?

888
00:47:53,950 --> 00:47:54,660
Repeat.

889
00:47:54,750 --> 00:47:57,080
The government has
developed some bad habits.

890
00:47:57,450 --> 00:47:58,890
- Bring more buttermilk.
- Of course.

891
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,330
Sir, everyone calls him Sakool.

892
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:07,290
But he looks more
Like play school to me.

893
00:48:07,450 --> 00:48:08,870
- Hurry up.
- He's stupid.

894
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:10,750
- How much more?
- Can he do it?

895
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:12,870
Don't know.

896
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:15,000
But start preparing.

897
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:20,870
- Do you remember his order?
- Of course, I do.

898
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:23,290
The regular. Bring his order.

899
00:48:23,410 --> 00:48:26,250
- Two whole chicken and fish fry.
- Almost done.

900
00:48:27,790 --> 00:48:29,160
Mushroom Masala and Peas.

901
00:48:29,370 --> 00:48:31,130
Please take my order first.
My mom's waiting.

902
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:33,120
Calm down, son. Calm down.

903
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:36,200
Or you might never make it home.

904
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:37,870
Look behind you.

905
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:39,200
It's death himself...

906
00:48:39,410 --> 00:48:42,000
Oh, God... isn't that Baldev Rana?

- Yes, sir.

00:51:30,290 --> 00:51:34,580
Why do weddings and accidents
happen only at night?

952

Some occasions feel better at night.

Sorry.

The Police always arrive late at the scene.

I know they are always late, but...

997
00:53:41,830 --> 00:53:44,120
sometimes I feel it's intentional.

way to scare the Police.

This is the Court. Imagine...

And this is the Police.

1005
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:07,790

wrong as long as they fear the Court.

Don't ruin my life for free pedicures.

1088
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:08,830
That gun might misfire, uncle.
Let me take that.

1089
00:59:08,910 --> 00:59:10,660
This one is a national judo player.

1090
00:59:10,790 --> 00:59:12,620
I've quit judo, mom.

1091
00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:13,700
Arjun.

1092
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:14,750
Come here.

1093
00:59:15,250 --> 00:59:16,290
What about her?

1094
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,080
Arjun.

1095
00:59:18,910 --> 00:59:19,910
- Doesn't matter.
- Arjun.

1096
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:22,910
Few months on a healthy diet
and she will be absolutely fine.

1097
00:59:23,910 --> 00:59:24,790
Look at her.

1098
00:59:24,870 --> 00:59:25,700
Look your hands are shivering.

1099
00:59:25,790 --> 00:59:29,120
Don't be scared.
He only plays with it, he never fires.

1100
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:30,580
Maybe today is the day.

1101
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:32,040
♪♪♪

1102
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:48,580
This rose will look
better in your new home.

1103
00:59:48,950 --> 00:59:52,250
But don't put on weight
after the wedding.

1104
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:54,580
I won't put on weight, aunty.

1105
00:59:54,700 --> 00:59:57,200
I'll make your son run after me forever.

1106
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,266
And you can give me some tips too.

1107
00:59:59,290 --> 01:00:03,040
- You don't look like one, but you are smart.
- "You are the only one I love..."

1108
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:05,870
"For you, I fend against the world,."

1109
01:00:05,910 --> 01:00:08,700
"May we never part ways..."

1110
01:00:08,830 --> 01:00:11,200
"that's all I pray to God for."

1111
01:00:11,290 --> 01:00:13,410
- No, thank you.
- Go on.

1112
01:00:23,290 --> 01:00:26,370
- Come, I'll show you.
- No, Arjun.

1113
01:00:26,910 --> 01:00:29,200
I don't think your
intentions are any good.

1114
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:32,830
You are very naughty, Ritu.

1115
01:00:32,950 --> 01:00:35,370
- This is my school.
- Your school.

1116
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:37,700
I've such beautiful memories about it.

1117
01:00:38,540 --> 01:00:40,250
You are just...
Come, let me show you.

1118
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:42,870
I used to sit back here.

1119
01:00:43,290 --> 01:00:45,910
I knew you were a backbencher.

1120
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:49,410
Ritu...

1121
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,620
How did you like my cute family?

1122
01:00:55,620 --> 01:00:56,660
Very cute.

1123
01:00:58,080 --> 01:00:59,450
And your papa...

1124
01:00:59,750 --> 01:01:01,660
- No.. No..
- Dadupapa...

1125
01:01:01,950 --> 01:01:03,080
He's cuter than you.

1126
01:01:06,290 --> 01:01:10,080
So when are you introducing
me to your cute family.

1127
01:01:16,750 --> 01:01:18,700
Even I vaguely remember them.

1128
01:01:31,660 --> 01:01:35,830
The people in my village would
draw guns over every trivial matter.

1129
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:42,870
Bloodshed was common.

1130
01:01:48,250 --> 01:01:49,870
I was only 8-year-old...

1131
01:01:53,700 --> 01:02:00,290
when my uncle shot my
mom and dad for a piece of land.

1132
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:08,580
I was very scared.

1133
01:02:13,870 --> 01:02:14,870
And ran away.

1134
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:20,700
I couldn't even...

1135
01:02:31,790 --> 01:02:33,500
- You made me cry.
- I know, sir. I know.

1136
01:02:35,910 --> 01:02:37,950
It's straight from my heart.

1137
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:47,120
I just realised,
Ritu, you're like a coconut.

1138
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:52,200
Soft on the inside,
and hard on the outside.

1139
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:57,370
I mean... sad...

1140
01:02:58,830 --> 01:03:00,580
Could have been a little romantic?

1141
01:03:01,910 --> 01:03:02,910
Oh no.

1142
01:03:12,540 --> 01:03:16,870
Sir, I think Dilbaug's right
hand Jamun and Baldev's Left hand Billu...

1143
01:03:16,950 --> 01:03:19,410
should play the quarterfinals.

1144
01:03:21,580 --> 01:03:22,910
What about the venue?

1145
01:03:23,450 --> 01:03:25,636
Enough blood has been spilt
on the streets and restaurants.

1146
01:03:25,660 --> 01:03:28,250
This time let's play
at our favourite spot.

1147
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:30,290
That's right.

1148
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:31,830
Fine...

1149
01:03:31,910 --> 01:03:34,080
Inform Billu where to
find Kala Jamun and gang.

1150
01:03:34,290 --> 01:03:36,176
And inform Kala Jamun
and gang where to find Billu.

1151
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:37,950
And what time?

1152
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:39,200
What's our off time?

1153
01:03:39,330 --> 01:03:40,120
Sharp 10 'o clock.

1154
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:41,910
So make it before that.

1155
01:03:41,950 --> 01:03:44,830
So store Jamun and Billu's number.

1156
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:46,160
And we'll call them.

1157
01:03:47,330 --> 01:03:49,176
Why didn't you write
these numbers in the capital letters?

1158
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:50,766
How can anyone write numbers
in capital letters?

1159
01:03:50,790 --> 01:03:53,620
But it's not a crime to write
in big and bold letters?

1160
01:03:54,950 --> 01:03:55,950
Come on.

1161
01:03:56,580 --> 01:03:58,040
One... Two...

1162
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:15,370
Sir, you proved a point today.

1163
01:04:16,580 --> 01:04:18,250
Even Police have a heart.

1164
01:04:18,540 --> 01:04:19,620
Obviously.

1165
01:04:19,910 --> 01:04:23,040
Who can tolerate so many
alcohol bottles getting blown up?

1166
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:25,700
I cannot see this.

1167
01:04:28,290 --> 01:04:29,290
Hello.

1168
01:04:31,250 --> 01:04:32,250
Yeah...

1169
01:04:33,660 --> 01:04:36,700
Onidda... I was thinking...

1170
01:04:37,330 --> 01:04:39,660
these guys emptied an
entire magazine on each other.

1171
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:41,410
You must take one.

1172
01:04:41,830 --> 01:04:42,830
You deserve at least one.

1173
01:04:42,910 --> 01:04:45,790
No... no... what are you saying?

1174
01:04:45,870 --> 01:04:49,330
We've already used the "Police
arrive late" excuse twice.

1175
01:04:49,450 --> 01:04:52,540
If anyone gets suspicious
about our crime-free state plan...

1176
01:04:52,660 --> 01:04:55,410
- then it will never come true.
- No... No, sir.

1177
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:56,910
I don't even take vitamin pills...

1178
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,450
- and you want to shoot me.
- Listen to me.

1179
01:04:59,580 --> 01:05:00,500
Don't you love your country?

1180
01:05:00,580 --> 01:05:03,790
People get bored even when
stand up for the National Anthem.

1181
01:05:03,910 --> 01:05:05,976
And you want me to take a bullet
for the country. Count me out.

1182
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,880
The media will be here soon.
What are you doing?

1183
01:05:07,910 --> 01:05:09,596
- Not me...
- Hold still. You're wasting my bullets.

1184
01:05:09,620 --> 01:05:11,200
For my sake.

1185
01:05:11,290 --> 01:05:13,950
Fine, I am taking this risk for me.

1186
01:05:14,330 --> 01:05:17,290
But if anyone ever finds out
about our crime-free district plan...

1187
01:05:17,410 --> 01:05:18,910
then I won't listen.

1188
01:05:18,950 --> 01:05:20,510
And shoot you in the heart, understand.

1189
01:05:20,620 --> 01:05:22,300
We'll cross that bridge
when we come to it.

1190
01:05:22,620 --> 01:05:23,750
Okay.

1191
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:28,250
So the contestants still left
are Dilbaug, who is behind bars...

1192
01:05:29,120 --> 01:05:31,700
Sakool, and his brother Anda.

1193
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:33,040
- Right?
- Yes.

1194
01:05:37,080 --> 01:05:39,620
Anda's brother will
pay him a visit today.

1195
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:55,450
Can this really be possible?

1196
01:05:55,580 --> 01:05:57,330
Patiala sir is on our side.

1197
01:05:57,540 --> 01:06:00,540
We're the king,
the prince, we'll build our own gang.

1198
01:06:04,910 --> 01:06:06,910
Meaning finally I'll
have hair on my head.

1199
01:06:07,290 --> 01:06:09,450
People won't call me Anda anymore.

1200
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:12,040
Anda...

1201
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:14,120
Listen to me... Anda...

1202
01:06:14,410 --> 01:06:15,700
- Thank you.
- Anda...

1203
01:06:15,830 --> 01:06:18,200
Anda... Listen to me.

1204
01:06:19,950 --> 01:06:20,540
Yes...

1205
01:06:20,790 --> 01:06:22,950
This is Patiala's popular burger.

1206
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:26,200
Not for you, it's for my brother.
He loves them. Please give it to him.

1207
01:06:27,290 --> 01:06:28,660
Why didn't you give him yourself?

1208
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:32,361
I never break the rules.
"Why didn't I give him yourself?"

1209
01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:37,370
Here you go. Especially for you.

1210
01:06:37,540 --> 01:06:38,750
From Patiala.

1211
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:42,410
I am loving it.

1212
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:01,080
Time to bring his glass of juice.

1213
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:03,250
Carrot, apples, beetroot.
Let's go.

1214
01:07:03,410 --> 01:07:04,450
Listen.

1215
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:07,410
- Don't forget the spinach leaves.
- Yes, boss.

1216
01:07:13,540 --> 01:07:14,700
Did you bring my pills?

1217
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:17,080
Give it.

1218
01:07:28,040 --> 01:07:30,910
You don't need pills,
you only need prayers.

1219
01:07:31,290 --> 01:07:32,830
You stabbed me.

1220
01:07:32,910 --> 01:07:34,910
- With a fork.
- You know my hemoglobin is low.

1221
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:35,660
Yes.

1222
01:07:35,790 --> 01:07:37,410
- This is Cheating.
- Yes.

1223
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:38,940
Couldn't you think of something new?

1224
01:07:39,160 --> 01:07:42,200
You could've dropped a bomb on me,
or ordered an air strike.

1225
01:07:42,330 --> 01:07:44,516
You should have thought of
something unique. Looked up on Google.

1226
01:07:44,540 --> 01:07:47,540
- Bloody unprofessional...
- Stop talking, Dilbaug...

1227
01:07:47,660 --> 01:07:48,700
Fork you.

1228
01:07:52,660 --> 01:07:54,450
Ohh... Lord...

1229
01:07:54,910 --> 01:07:57,000
What an irony, Lord.

1230
01:07:58,080 --> 01:08:00,160
Boss... Boss...

1231
01:08:00,700 --> 01:08:01,750
- Boss...
- What happened?

1232
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:03,040
Boss...

1233
01:08:03,410 --> 01:08:04,910
What happened?

1234
01:08:05,910 --> 01:08:07,160
Boss... Ambulance.

1235
01:08:14,910 --> 01:08:15,910
Hey...

1236
01:08:16,910 --> 01:08:17,910
Hey...!

1237
01:08:18,750 --> 01:08:20,660
Are you all deaf.

1238
01:08:21,790 --> 01:08:22,830
Eyes down.

1239
01:08:23,410 --> 01:08:24,870
You are the king here.

1240
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:26,040
Talk to them.

1241
01:08:26,540 --> 01:08:27,330
I am the king.

1242
01:08:27,540 --> 01:08:29,000
- Bring my food.
- Yes.

1243
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:33,160
Sakool... case closed.

1244
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:35,176
Now the fork will be
recovered from my cell.

1245
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:36,540
And they will take me to court.

1246
01:08:36,660 --> 01:08:38,300
And you can break me out on the way.
Okay.

1247
01:08:39,540 --> 01:08:40,540
Yes.

1248
01:08:43,450 --> 01:08:44,730
Do you know what this is called?

1249
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:46,120
Burger.

1250
01:08:47,830 --> 01:08:49,870
Eyes down. King. King.

1251
01:08:54,160 --> 01:08:57,580
What happened? What happened?

1252
01:08:57,700 --> 01:09:00,660
What happened, Anda?

1253
01:09:05,660 --> 01:09:08,910
You cannot leave us.

1254
01:09:09,950 --> 01:09:13,700
I want to die too.

1255
01:09:13,830 --> 01:09:15,580
That's Dilbaug, Anda's on this side.

1256
01:09:15,660 --> 01:09:17,450
Brother...

1257
01:09:18,830 --> 01:09:23,000
- Take me with you.
- Go lie down with him.

1258
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:25,500
Brother...

1259
01:09:37,660 --> 01:09:39,290
Brother, I am famished.

1260
01:09:39,700 --> 01:09:41,290
- I'll go get something to eat.
- Go on.

1261
01:09:43,410 --> 01:09:44,580
Brother...

1262
01:09:57,040 --> 01:09:58,540
Destiny is inevitable.

1263
01:09:59,750 --> 01:10:01,120
What kind of fork was it?

1264
01:10:02,620 --> 01:10:04,250
It was dipped in poison.

1265
01:10:05,660 --> 01:10:09,790
The fork was ours, but Dilbaug's
henchmen killed your brother.

1266
01:10:10,290 --> 01:10:11,790
You must take revenge, Sakool.

1267
01:10:12,410 --> 01:10:13,410
How?

1268
01:10:13,830 --> 01:10:16,450
Soon we will arrest you
for a high profile murder case...

1269
01:10:16,700 --> 01:10:18,380
and send you to a high-security prison.

1270
01:10:18,580 --> 01:10:20,000
Then you can take your revenge.

1271
01:10:20,870 --> 01:10:22,030
But who am I going to murder?

1272
01:10:22,410 --> 01:10:24,620
Hello and welcome.
The hot topic of the day...

1273
01:10:24,700 --> 01:10:27,700
is that the criminals of
Ferozpur are killing each other.

1274
01:10:27,830 --> 01:10:29,910
And the Police are taking no action.

1275
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:32,790
We want to know what
the Police are doing about it.

1276
01:10:32,910 --> 01:10:34,200
As you can see...

1277
01:10:34,330 --> 01:10:37,950
we have Arjun Patiala
and Constable Onidda.

1278
01:10:38,620 --> 01:10:41,620
Don't you think that the
criminals are killing each other...

1279
01:10:41,700 --> 01:10:43,556
and the streets are
getting rid of criminals.

1280
01:10:43,580 --> 01:10:45,870
The Police are sitting idle.
I mean what are you doing?

1281
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,750
What do mean we're sitting idle?

1282
01:10:47,830 --> 01:10:49,660
Do you really believe
this is a coincidence?

1283
01:10:49,750 --> 01:10:50,976
Do you know how hard
we had to plan for all this...

1284
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,500
- Sir has more plans up his sleeve...
- No... we are sad.

1285
01:10:53,950 --> 01:10:55,330
We are very sad.

1286
01:10:56,500 --> 01:10:57,500
Sad.

1287
01:10:58,540 --> 01:10:59,540
Very sad.

1288
01:10:59,700 --> 01:11:01,250
Very-very sad.

1289
01:11:02,790 --> 01:11:06,120
You see madam,
we don't do our job for the salary...

1290
01:11:06,250 --> 01:11:07,676
we do it for the love of our country.

1291
01:11:07,700 --> 01:11:09,976
It's not our fault if they are
not dying by the hands of the Police.

1292
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:11,306
They are fighting among
themselves and drying.

1293
01:11:11,330 --> 01:11:13,120
Correct. Destiny is inevitable.

1294
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:15,410
Yes... But this
interview can be averted.

1295
01:11:15,910 --> 01:11:17,370
That's the end.

1296
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:19,870
Jai Hind. Goodbye.

1297
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:22,160
Where are you going, sir?
Please...

1298
01:11:22,250 --> 01:11:25,330
As you can see... the Police
left without giving an answer.

1299
01:11:25,410 --> 01:11:29,000
Why is the Police trying
to dodge the media's questions?

1300
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:31,410
The situation is pretty tense.

1301
01:11:31,540 --> 01:11:35,370
Sooner or later the
Police will have to answer.

1302
01:11:35,620 --> 01:11:37,910
This is Mohit, with cameraman Rahul.

1303
01:11:42,790 --> 01:11:43,250
Hello.

1304
01:11:43,370 --> 01:11:46,330
Those are shoelaces
and not your drawstring.

1305
01:11:46,410 --> 01:11:47,500
Idiot.

1306
01:11:48,700 --> 01:11:50,330
- Hello, aunty...
- Hello...

1307
01:11:50,410 --> 01:11:51,250
How are you, dear?

1308
01:11:51,370 --> 01:11:53,160
Are you coming over for Diwali, dear?

1309
01:11:56,290 --> 01:11:58,410
- I don't know, aunty.
- What do you mean?

1310
01:11:59,950 --> 01:12:01,540
Even I don't know what I mean.

1311
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:04,830
My heart says this is wrong.

1312
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:07,950
But my mind is saying
I should ignore it.

1313
01:12:10,290 --> 01:12:11,080
What should I do?

1314
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:14,080
Look dear, always listen to your heart.

1315
01:12:14,540 --> 01:12:17,450
Just like my heart's saying...

1316
01:12:17,950 --> 01:12:20,580
I should throw your stupid
dadupapa out of the house.

1317
01:12:20,660 --> 01:12:22,750
Have you lost your mind, old man?

1318
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:37,580
"I saw a shooting star..."

1319
01:12:37,660 --> 01:12:39,370
"and it reminded me of you."

1320
01:12:39,410 --> 01:12:42,290
"it reminded me of you."

1321
01:12:42,450 --> 01:12:44,160
"Can't live without you."

1322
01:12:44,290 --> 01:12:46,200
"and it reminded me of you."

1323
01:12:46,290 --> 01:12:49,370
"it reminded me of you."

1324
01:13:01,620 --> 01:13:02,750
Nice weather, right.

1325
01:13:05,410 --> 01:13:06,970
But couldn't we meet some place better?

1326
01:13:07,950 --> 01:13:10,410
I mean this railway track, the bridge...

1327
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:12,870
All this reminds me of the film Deewar.

1328
01:13:13,910 --> 01:13:16,450
Like... even brothers part way on bridges.

1329
01:13:16,700 --> 01:13:18,790
Like lovers go separate ways.

1330
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:22,750
Our paths were always separate,
Inspector.

1331
01:13:24,410 --> 01:13:25,450
But it can converge...

1332
01:13:26,410 --> 01:13:28,410
if you tell me the truth.

1333
01:13:30,450 --> 01:13:31,540
Why so serious?

1334
01:13:33,160 --> 01:13:33,830
What truth?

1335
01:13:33,950 --> 01:13:35,700
Let's stop pretending now.

1336
01:13:36,620 --> 01:13:38,250
Where Two fight, the third one wins.

1337
01:13:38,540 --> 01:13:39,676
That was your plan all along, wasn't it?

1338
01:13:39,700 --> 01:13:40,790
Crime Free district.

1339
01:13:48,910 --> 01:13:51,410
Even if it was, were you
planning a sting operation on me.

1340
01:13:53,700 --> 01:13:55,500
I am not sad those gangsters are dead.

1341
01:13:55,750 --> 01:13:57,950
Dead or murdered?
This was a murder.

1342
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:00,120
Can anyone prove it?

1343
01:14:00,540 --> 01:14:01,540
I will.

1344
01:14:04,370 --> 01:14:05,700
Look, I...

1345
01:14:07,290 --> 01:14:08,620
I trusted you.

1346
01:14:13,250 --> 01:14:14,370
You were right, Arjun.

1347
01:14:16,830 --> 01:14:18,290
This is were paths separate.

1348
01:14:20,410 --> 01:14:21,660
"I saw a shooting star..."

1349
01:14:21,750 --> 01:14:23,410
"and it reminded me of you."

1350
01:14:23,660 --> 01:14:26,910
"it reminded me of you."

1351
01:14:27,750 --> 01:14:30,410
"You can break my heart..."

1352
01:14:30,580 --> 01:14:34,580
"Break my heart..."

1353
01:14:34,660 --> 01:14:38,000
"the more I love you."

1354
01:14:41,500 --> 01:14:44,200
"You can turn your back on me..."

1355
01:14:44,330 --> 01:14:48,250
"Turn on me..."

1356
01:14:48,410 --> 01:14:51,450
"the more I love you."

1357
01:14:55,290 --> 01:15:01,330
"Tears in my eyes... and
memories on my mind."

1358
01:15:01,830 --> 01:15:04,250
"You are my God..."

1359
01:15:04,370 --> 01:15:08,200
"who is going to hear my prayers."

1360
01:15:08,950 --> 01:15:11,580
"The more the world taunts me..."

1361
01:15:11,700 --> 01:15:15,580
"Taunts me..."

1362
01:15:15,790 --> 01:15:19,040
"the more I love you."

1363
01:15:22,620 --> 01:15:25,250
"You can turn your back on me..."

1364
01:15:25,410 --> 01:15:29,410
"Turn on me..."

1365
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:32,700
"the more I love you."

1366
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:41,160
Evidence.

1367
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:42,620
Evidence?

1368
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:45,160
This is evidence... of true love, madam.

1369
01:15:45,410 --> 01:15:47,290
Your rose has changed its colour.

1370
01:15:47,370 --> 01:15:48,450
Due to his alcohol.

1371
01:15:48,540 --> 01:15:50,200
Even nature is bowing before him.

1372
01:15:50,370 --> 01:15:51,910
What nonsense?
Have you lost your mind?

1373
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,370
People in ordinary
love with ordinary grief...

1374
01:15:54,580 --> 01:15:56,370
turn to alcohol for support.

1375
01:15:56,580 --> 01:15:58,330
But won't you call
this extraordinary love.

1376
01:15:58,410 --> 01:15:59,580
He has quit drinking.

1377
01:15:59,790 --> 01:16:01,450
Do you know how frustrating it is?

1378
01:16:01,540 --> 01:16:02,580
Frustrating?

1379
01:16:02,700 --> 01:16:03,540
No, sister-in-law.

1380
01:16:03,620 --> 01:16:04,750
Don't call me sister-in-law.

1381
01:16:04,910 --> 01:16:06,910
And if your boss really loves me...

1382
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:09,660
then tell him to stop this bloodshed.

1383
01:16:09,790 --> 01:16:11,110
'Sister-in-law knows everything.'

1384
01:16:11,250 --> 01:16:12,580
Yes, I know.

1385
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,560
I am going to cover Sakool's statement.

1386
01:16:17,750 --> 01:16:19,750
He might say something against you guys.

1387
01:16:20,040 --> 01:16:21,120
And then...

1388
01:16:21,330 --> 01:16:24,700
How can you think of taking
Sakool's help when I am still around?

1389
01:16:25,160 --> 01:16:26,540
I should die.

1390
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:28,580
No more crimes.

1391
01:16:28,830 --> 01:16:30,620
I will take the blame for everything.

1392

So done.

Fine.

This is going to take some time.

01:19:28,620 --> 01:19:29,750
MLA madam.

1438
01:19:31,330 --> 01:19:32,330
DSP.

1439
01:19:33,330 --> 01:19:34,330
Media guy...

1440
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:38,200
Feels like I am watching
some regional action film on TV...

1441
01:19:38,910 --> 01:19:42,080
where a good Police officer
is going to get in trouble.

1442
01:19:50,910 --> 01:19:53,500
Patiala... snap out of it.

1443
01:19:53,700 --> 01:19:54,700
And look.

1444
01:19:59,540 --> 01:20:00,540
Stop.

1445
01:20:00,700 --> 01:20:02,450
- And this one too.
- One minute.

1446
01:20:03,660 --> 01:20:04,700
Smile.

1447
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:08,330
You will get tired.

1448
01:20:08,580 --> 01:20:10,950
- Climb on.
- Catch him.

1449
01:20:18,040 --> 01:20:19,370
- You know...
- Yes...

1450
01:20:19,450 --> 01:20:22,450
Retail crime is very messy.

1451
01:20:23,250 --> 01:20:25,200
And these days Malls are the new trend...

1452
01:20:25,370 --> 01:20:27,170
where one can find
everything in one place.

1453
01:20:27,410 --> 01:20:29,500
So... who has power?

1454
01:20:30,040 --> 01:20:31,080
I do.

1455
01:20:31,290 --> 01:20:32,580
So whose responsibility is it?

1456
01:20:32,790 --> 01:20:33,790
Mine.

1457
01:20:33,830 --> 01:20:37,330
If people have questions,
who is going to answer them, Mr. Bhatia?

1458
01:20:38,410 --> 01:20:39,290
Forget it.

1459
01:20:39,410 --> 01:20:40,410
Me of course.

1460
01:20:40,750 --> 01:20:43,500
- Now... who is the biggest villain?
- You.

1461
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:45,580
See... that's timing.

1462
01:20:46,250 --> 01:20:47,790
I couldn't control myself, madam.

1463
01:20:49,250 --> 01:20:51,450
All I wanted to say was...

1464
01:20:51,700 --> 01:20:54,660
these people are criminals after all.

1465
01:20:54,790 --> 01:20:56,370
And they cannot be trusted...

1466
01:20:56,410 --> 01:20:57,636
because they are
capable of doing anything.

1467
01:20:57,660 --> 01:20:59,620
If I send them to jail...

1468
01:20:59,790 --> 01:21:01,290
That's the condition of our jails.

1469
01:21:01,790 --> 01:21:03,410
And they will escape.

1470
01:21:03,620 --> 01:21:06,950
And if we kill them in encounters,
it will become controversial.

1471
01:21:07,080 --> 01:21:09,290
The media's here for it.

1472
01:21:10,250 --> 01:21:12,290
Turning a mole into a mountain.

1473
01:21:12,410 --> 01:21:14,080
That's our job, ma'am.

1474
01:21:15,160 --> 01:21:17,000
Check that side.

1475
01:21:17,080 --> 01:21:19,040
Look down... I'll look here.

1476
01:21:20,290 --> 01:21:21,610
He must be hiding somewhere here.

1477
01:21:21,950 --> 01:21:23,160
Gill sir.

1478
01:21:24,040 --> 01:21:25,040
Hello...

1479
01:21:25,290 --> 01:21:26,950
- this way.
- Yes, ma'am.

1480
01:21:29,410 --> 01:21:30,370
Explain to him.

1481
01:21:30,410 --> 01:21:31,410
Of course.

1482
01:21:33,950 --> 01:21:35,540
He's a smart kid, madam.

1483
01:21:36,410 --> 01:21:38,370
He doesn't need any explanation.
He will kill him.

1484
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:42,120
Look Patiala, you've to kill Onidda.

1485
01:21:42,500 --> 01:21:45,370
And Ritu doesn't have
any concrete evidence.

1486
01:21:45,910 --> 01:21:47,120
Madam...

1487
01:21:47,750 --> 01:21:50,160
I cannot tell him to kill Ritu.

1488
01:21:50,410 --> 01:21:52,426
They are in love after all.
Logic doesn't work here...

1489
01:21:52,450 --> 01:21:53,450
Right.

1490
01:21:54,160 --> 01:21:55,290
Let it be.

1491
01:22:00,290 --> 01:22:02,200
Last time you visited us...

1492
01:22:03,120 --> 01:22:04,830
the rate of crime had plummeted.

1493
01:22:06,370 --> 01:22:07,690
But now it's on an all-time high.

1494
01:22:08,040 --> 01:22:09,660
It's the system, Patiala.

1495
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:12,280
Ups and downs are a part of it.

1496
01:22:18,250 --> 01:22:18,950
Hello, sir.

1497
01:22:19,250 --> 01:22:20,250
Sir, I've terrible news.

1498
01:22:20,620 --> 01:22:21,860
Imagine the Police has to hide.

1499
01:22:22,040 --> 01:22:23,726
Meet me on the bridge
over the stream in one hour.

1500
01:22:23,750 --> 01:22:25,290
Along with cocoa-cola and soda.

1501
01:22:25,450 --> 01:22:27,790
We'll solve this problem
over a glass of alcohol.

1502
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:29,200
Okay. Over and Out.

1503
01:22:29,290 --> 01:22:30,290
Sir...

1504
01:22:30,790 --> 01:22:36,080
- What a smart kid. What a smart kid.
- Very smart. Very smart.

1505
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:38,000
Well madam, now that I'm in deep waters...

1506
01:22:38,160 --> 01:22:41,950
I am not a crocodile hunter
to lock horns with a monster.

1507
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:56,750
Sir. Sir.

1508
01:22:57,500 --> 01:22:58,870
Sir. Sir.

1509
01:22:59,000 --> 01:22:59,910
Looking awesome.

1510
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,680
Sir, you will never believe it.
There is a bigger game at play here.

1511
01:23:02,750 --> 01:23:04,080
Did you get the stuff?

1512
01:23:04,660 --> 01:23:06,950
- Come on.
- I was following the editor...

1513
01:23:07,080 --> 01:23:09,620
and do you know where he led me to.
To the MLA's house.

1514
01:23:09,700 --> 01:23:10,750
Where is the soda?

1515
01:23:10,910 --> 01:23:12,620
You can't stop thinking about soda?

1516
01:23:12,700 --> 01:23:15,700
Do you know where I saw him go?
Even DSP Gill is a part of them.

1517
01:23:15,790 --> 01:23:18,200
- He's calling the shots.
- Who?

1518
01:23:19,700 --> 01:23:21,580
You didn't bring the soda?

1519
01:23:21,660 --> 01:23:23,000
Here. Who is behind this plot?

1520
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:26,620
DSP...

1521
01:23:32,870 --> 01:23:34,250
Sorry, Onidda.

1522
01:23:56,410 --> 01:23:57,410
Done, madam.

1523
01:23:58,080 --> 01:23:59,250
Not yet.

1524
01:23:59,450 --> 01:24:02,000
I just completed the front side.

1525
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:06,040
I still have to knit the arms,
and the neck.

1526
01:24:07,660 --> 01:24:09,500
If you want another star here...

1527
01:24:09,950 --> 01:24:12,500
then that will
cost you two dead bodies.

1528
01:24:13,410 --> 01:24:16,200
Onidda and Sakool.

1529
01:24:16,330 --> 01:24:17,830
And with evidence.

1530
01:24:17,950 --> 01:24:20,080
That place where you keep dead bodies...

1531
01:24:20,200 --> 01:24:22,660
- The morgue.
- Yes.

1532
01:24:22,750 --> 01:24:24,870
- That's where I'll come down to see.
- Of course.

1533
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:27,370
- Good.
- Very good.

1534
01:24:27,540 --> 01:24:30,410
I'll finish this,
and you finish your job.

1535
01:24:30,700 --> 01:24:31,700
- Right?
- Yes.

1536
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:34,040
Come on.

1537
01:24:56,200 --> 01:24:58,250
Why isn't Onidda answering his phone?

1538
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:00,620
Ritu.

1539
01:25:00,700 --> 01:25:02,540
People found a dead
body near the river stream.

1540
01:25:02,580 --> 01:25:03,580
Did they identify him?

1541
01:25:03,830 --> 01:25:05,660
They are saying it's some constable.

1542
01:25:35,160 --> 01:25:36,290
Go on, go on.

1543
01:25:36,620 --> 01:25:38,120
How else will you sleep tonight?

1544
01:25:39,620 --> 01:25:41,290
This is what happens?

1545
01:25:42,370 --> 01:25:44,410
While you're shedding others blood...

1546
01:25:44,500 --> 01:25:47,620
you don't realise
when you kill one of your own.

1547
01:25:55,200 --> 01:25:56,410
Dialogue.

1548
01:26:00,370 --> 01:26:04,540
When I am drunk, I start slurring.

1549
01:26:05,500 --> 01:26:06,500
Okay.

1550
01:26:10,370 --> 01:26:14,290
But don't be under the impression that
I will spare you because Onidda is dead.

1551
01:26:15,660 --> 01:26:17,540
I have enough evidence.

1552
01:26:19,250 --> 01:26:22,910
Now ask your soul whether
what you did was right or wrong.

1553
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:27,330
Ask your soul.

1554
01:26:29,410 --> 01:26:30,660
Are you serious?

1555
01:26:31,580 --> 01:26:32,700
Damn serious.

1556
01:27:00,540 --> 01:27:01,620
So tell me.

1557
01:27:02,580 --> 01:27:03,580
What?

1558
01:27:03,750 --> 01:27:07,910
What should I do next
after killing my friend?

1559
01:27:08,410 --> 01:27:11,410
Take revenge for your friend's death.

1560
01:27:11,830 --> 01:27:12,830
Yes.

1561
01:27:13,040 --> 01:27:14,080
But how?

1562
01:27:14,410 --> 01:27:18,200
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

1563
01:27:18,410 --> 01:27:19,410
Correct.

1564
01:27:19,450 --> 01:27:21,410
But why are you slurring?

1565
01:27:21,580 --> 01:27:26,790
When the guy is slurring,
the spirit has no choice.

1566
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:29,410
You are right.
The spirit won't have an option.

1567
01:27:29,910 --> 01:27:32,540
So... should I call Sakool?

1568
01:27:33,370 --> 01:27:34,370
Yes.

1569
01:27:34,410 --> 01:27:37,500
What was his number?
Dial his number.

1570
01:27:42,910 --> 01:27:44,160
It's ringing.

1571
01:27:44,290 --> 01:27:46,200
You got my phone all wet...

1572
01:27:46,540 --> 01:27:48,540
- Hello, Sakool.
- Who is this?

1573
01:27:48,660 --> 01:27:50,540
This is Arjun Patiala speaking.

1574
01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:53,500
You wanted to know whom
should I take revenge from?

1575
01:27:53,660 --> 01:27:54,160
Yes.

1576
01:27:54,410 --> 01:27:57,790
So I want to tell you
who is behind all this.

1577
01:27:58,040 --> 01:27:59,200
Now listen to me carefully.

1578
01:28:07,410 --> 01:28:08,580
Tell me, sir.

1579
01:28:08,790 --> 01:28:09,790
You tell me.

1580
01:28:10,120 --> 01:28:11,790
You called me, I didn't call you.

1581
01:28:11,910 --> 01:28:13,450
But you called me.

1582
01:28:13,540 --> 01:28:16,120
Why would I call you
in the middle of the night.

1583
01:28:16,250 --> 01:28:16,950
MLA.

1584
01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:18,410
Stop slurring first.

1585
01:28:18,450 --> 01:28:20,700
- And tell me who I've to take revenge from.
- MLA.

1586
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,950
Yes... I am telling you.
Why do you have to interfere?

1587
01:28:24,410 --> 01:28:27,160
If you interfere again,
I will shoot you.

1588
01:28:27,250 --> 01:28:28,540
Sorry, sir. You speak.

1589
01:28:38,450 --> 01:28:40,000
Understood.

1590
01:28:40,410 --> 01:28:44,330
Your remaining enemies
are in the bigger jail.

1591
01:28:44,410 --> 01:28:47,450
And no one can stop you from
going to a high society prison...

1592
01:28:47,540 --> 01:28:49,620
after committing
this high profile murder.

1593
01:28:49,750 --> 01:28:52,750
Come down to the morgue tomorrow.

1594
01:28:52,910 --> 01:28:55,120
And take everyone by storm.

1595
01:28:55,370 --> 01:28:56,410
Morgue...

1596
01:28:56,580 --> 01:28:59,950
The place where they
keep dead guys like you.

1597
01:29:00,540 --> 01:29:03,080
Tomorrow the crime rate will go up...

1598
01:29:03,200 --> 01:29:04,660
and also sink forever.

1599
01:29:04,910 --> 01:29:07,410
Patiala... don't talk about drowning.

1600
01:29:07,500 --> 01:29:09,160
It will drown a little later.

1601
01:29:09,330 --> 01:29:11,620
We already have a guy who has drowned.

1602
01:29:11,700 --> 01:29:13,410
I am hanging up now. Bye.

1603
01:29:13,750 --> 01:29:16,040
This Sakool is such a talkative guy.

1604
01:29:17,700 --> 01:29:19,700
Patiala, can I leave?

1605
01:29:19,790 --> 01:29:21,290
Of course, swim away.

1606
01:29:33,870 --> 01:29:35,160
Faster than lightning.

1607
01:29:36,580 --> 01:29:38,160
I thought you are the smart one.

1608
01:29:38,500 --> 01:29:39,870
But no...

1609
01:29:40,450 --> 01:29:42,000
Why couldn't you figure out...

1610
01:29:42,200 --> 01:29:46,830
that the Police used you to
kill Baldev Rana, then Dilbaug in jail...

1611
01:29:46,950 --> 01:29:49,950
then your poor brother.
And next...

1612
01:29:50,250 --> 01:29:51,540
Make a wild guess.

1613
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:54,800
Come here, let me show you something.
Come on.

1614
01:29:59,830 --> 01:30:01,080
Is it stinking?

1615
01:30:01,370 --> 01:30:03,910
I've been surrounded by
this stink for the last 18 years.

1616
01:30:04,200 --> 01:30:05,790
I reek of it myself.

1617
01:30:05,910 --> 01:30:08,450
But this doesn't stink
as much as your society.

1618
01:30:08,830 --> 01:30:11,040
You figured out that
the Police are behind it...

1619
01:30:12,080 --> 01:30:14,250
but, do you know who
is actually calling the shots?

1620
01:30:14,580 --> 01:30:15,580
Who?

1621
01:30:19,200 --> 01:30:21,386
I won't tell you,
otherwise, the nine o'clock news will be...

1622
01:30:21,410 --> 01:30:24,830
"This is Ritu Randhawa,
with so-and-so cameraman."

1623
01:30:24,950 --> 01:30:26,080
No, I won't tell you.

1624
01:30:26,200 --> 01:30:27,200
But...

1625
01:30:28,200 --> 01:30:31,040
whoever is calling the
shots won't survive for too long.

1626
01:30:31,370 --> 01:30:34,200
And all the Policemen who know
about it are going to die as well.

1627
01:30:34,910 --> 01:30:37,580
Now that get recorder
out of your pocket.

1628
01:30:38,410 --> 01:30:39,500
Come on.

1629
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:41,080
Sit down.

1630
01:30:45,160 --> 01:30:47,480
Now you have all the evidence
and witnesses against Sakool.

1631
01:30:47,870 --> 01:30:50,370
And you've also recorded
our little conversation.

1632
01:30:50,580 --> 01:30:52,410
So... now you will have to die.

1633
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:55,910
We will keep this personal.
I will stab you only twice.

1634
01:30:56,580 --> 01:30:58,450
This is no fun at all.

1635
01:31:01,750 --> 01:31:02,910
Madam...

1636
01:31:03,330 --> 01:31:05,870
I've 12-years of experience
behind me with guns and knives.

1637
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:07,520
I promise you it won't be painful all.

1638
01:31:08,370 --> 01:31:10,830
Ritu, people make mistakes.

1639
01:31:10,950 --> 01:31:12,950
But it can't be death for one mistake.

1640
01:31:14,700 --> 01:31:15,750
Arjun was right.

1641
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:17,640
People like Sakool
don't understand words.

1642
01:31:17,790 --> 01:31:19,040
Not your pen.

1643
01:31:19,540 --> 01:31:20,540
Arjun.

1644
01:31:22,290 --> 01:31:26,000
The number you're calling
is showing attitude.

1645
01:31:31,790 --> 01:31:32,830
Bloody attitude.

1646
01:31:37,870 --> 01:31:38,540
Hello, aunty.

1647
01:31:38,620 --> 01:31:41,080
How are you?
Are you coming over for Diwali?

1648
01:31:41,200 --> 01:31:42,830
I will if I make it out alive.

1649
01:31:43,120 --> 01:31:43,830
What?

1650
01:31:43,910 --> 01:31:45,500
You told me to listen to my heart.

1651
01:31:46,200 --> 01:31:48,370
But now I am in deep trouble...

1652
01:31:49,910 --> 01:31:52,000
But that was just a stupid rant.

1653
01:31:52,370 --> 01:31:53,370
What...

1654
01:31:53,500 --> 01:31:57,370
I brought the old man
back home soon enough.

1655
01:31:57,450 --> 01:31:59,910
The heart is only
good for pumping blood.

1656
01:32:00,160 --> 01:32:02,200
Always listen to your mind for advice.

1657
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,160
What is your mind saying now?

1658
01:32:05,290 --> 01:32:07,120
My mind's saying run Ritu.

1659
01:32:07,200 --> 01:32:09,200
Then stop wasting time. And run.

1660
01:32:10,410 --> 01:32:11,750
Yes... Okay.

1661
01:32:13,290 --> 01:32:16,370
Madam... Listen to me.

1662
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,250
- Drive. Drive.
- Stop.

1663
01:32:22,750 --> 01:32:26,040
Just play my conversation,
and I will handle the rest.

1664
01:32:26,330 --> 01:32:27,580
Come in.

1665
01:32:29,950 --> 01:32:30,870
- It's really cold.
- Honestly.

1666
01:32:30,950 --> 01:32:33,160
Yes...
Is it your first time here?

1667
01:32:33,370 --> 01:32:35,620
- Okay Are they all dead?
- Yes.

1668
01:32:36,290 --> 01:32:37,290
I see...

1669
01:32:38,040 --> 01:32:38,750
Oh my, God.

1670
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:40,440
- It's really cold.
- God bless you.

1671
01:32:41,620 --> 01:32:43,950
There is no one except for us.

1672
01:32:44,200 --> 01:32:45,290
It's Diwali after all.

1673
01:32:45,410 --> 01:32:46,580
Everyone's gone home.

1674
01:32:46,870 --> 01:32:48,200
I am here to welcome you.

1675
01:32:48,330 --> 01:32:50,160
As well as Onidda
and Sakool's body inside.

1676
01:32:50,410 --> 01:32:51,330
Yes...

1677
01:32:51,410 --> 01:32:54,040
And they are not going
anywhere for Diwali.

1678
01:32:59,450 --> 01:33:01,200
Here you go, madam.
Check the presentation.

1679
01:33:01,290 --> 01:33:02,290
What kind of bed is this?

1680
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:05,200
He looks fresh.

1681
01:33:05,290 --> 01:33:06,410
Yes, he's fresh.

1682
01:33:07,790 --> 01:33:08,830
Where is Sakool?

1683
01:33:09,790 --> 01:33:11,160
Where is Sakool?

1684
01:33:12,080 --> 01:33:14,120
Here is Sakool Show me.

1685
01:33:14,330 --> 01:33:15,870
This is Sakool.

1686
01:33:18,120 --> 01:33:19,160
Where did he go?

1687
01:33:19,290 --> 01:33:20,830
Come here, Patiala.

1688
01:33:22,870 --> 01:33:26,160
You're a bad student,
fumbled on the last day.

1689
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:28,620
May I come in, madam?

1690
01:33:32,620 --> 01:33:34,830
I am deeply thankful to all of you.

1691
01:33:34,950 --> 01:33:36,226
For gathering around in one place.

1692
01:33:36,250 --> 01:33:38,806
Otherwise, I would have to find
each one separately and kill them.

1693
01:33:38,830 --> 01:33:40,410
Correct. It's too tiring.

1694
01:33:40,830 --> 01:33:42,160
So... who wants to go first?

1695
01:33:42,370 --> 01:33:43,790
Patiala, of course.

1696
01:33:44,200 --> 01:33:46,500
But I am on your side.

1697
01:33:46,950 --> 01:33:48,910
And DSP will shoot him next.

1698
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:55,120
And I will put you
two to rest next to Onidda.

1699
01:34:00,290 --> 01:34:02,136
"Meet me on the bridge over
the river stream in an hour."

1700
01:34:02,160 --> 01:34:03,290
"With coco cola and soda."

1701
01:34:03,500 --> 01:34:04,750
"Cocoa cola? Soda?"

1702
01:34:05,080 --> 01:34:07,500
"But we never use soda with our drinks."

1703
01:34:08,120 --> 01:34:09,120
"Something is wrong."

1704
01:34:09,330 --> 01:34:11,160
"I think sir is in trouble."

1705
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:12,700
"I got it."

1706
01:34:13,080 --> 01:34:14,080
"Sir.."

1707
01:34:14,910 --> 01:34:16,870
The bullets are not real,
please don't over react.

1708
01:34:18,160 --> 01:34:19,160
Sorry, Onidda.

1709
01:34:19,200 --> 01:34:20,790
With you, sorry, always.

1710
01:34:27,080 --> 01:34:28,080
Run, Onidda.

1711
01:34:32,450 --> 01:34:33,500
What are you doing, sir?

1712
01:34:33,750 --> 01:34:35,950
- Bringing the temperature down.
- Minus 20...!

1713
01:34:36,910 --> 01:34:38,540
Minus 40... have you lost your mind?

1714
01:34:40,870 --> 01:34:41,910
We left our guy inside.

1715
01:34:45,200 --> 01:34:47,290
- "Tell me one thing, sir."
- "Ask."

1716
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:49,370
"The Police are in synch..."

1717
01:34:49,580 --> 01:34:51,580
"but, what about the Politicians."

1718
01:34:52,500 --> 01:34:53,870
"Never son, never."

1719
01:34:54,910 --> 01:34:56,910
"We'll have to fool those as♪♪♪♪"

1720
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:58,160
As♪♪♪

1721
01:34:58,290 --> 01:35:00,080
I got it. Correct.

1722
01:35:08,200 --> 01:35:09,250
Freeze.

1723
01:35:11,250 --> 01:35:13,000
Patiala sir...

1724
01:35:13,290 --> 01:35:14,750
Patiala sir...

1725
01:35:16,330 --> 01:35:18,500
With you, For you... Always.

1726
01:35:22,200 --> 01:35:23,790
They are all in this together.

1727
01:35:23,870 --> 01:35:26,620
Congratulations,
sir, the district's now crime free.

1728
01:35:26,790 --> 01:35:27,790
Sir...

1729
01:35:28,160 --> 01:35:29,250
You know its Diwali.

1730
01:35:29,500 --> 01:35:31,500
I promised my dadupapa
that I will come home.

1731
01:35:31,790 --> 01:35:33,500
- Can I get the day off?
- Nah...

1732
01:35:33,790 --> 01:35:35,250
I've done such an important job.

1733
01:35:35,620 --> 01:35:38,830
We respect you a lot,
but such an attitude is not good.

1734
01:35:38,950 --> 01:35:40,910
Onidda, this is not attitude...

1735
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,580
- it's the freezing point.
- Yes.

1736
01:35:46,500 --> 01:35:48,290
Day off. Day off.

1737
01:35:56,910 --> 01:35:57,910
I won't spare him.

1738
01:36:01,540 --> 01:36:03,540
It's open. It's open. Come on.

1739
01:36:20,200 --> 01:36:21,500
Let it go now, Ritu.

1740
01:36:21,750 --> 01:36:24,620
We only played this charade
to fool Property Makkar.

1741
01:36:24,790 --> 01:36:27,056
And from today we'll do
everything according to the rules.

1742
01:36:27,080 --> 01:36:28,080
Rules?

1743
01:36:28,200 --> 01:36:30,580
- We're going triple seat.
- Listen to yourselves.

1744
01:36:30,790 --> 01:36:32,870
It's a romantic ambience,
we're heading to Patiala...

1745
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,290
say something romantic to each other.

1746
01:36:36,120 --> 01:36:38,120
Sorry, I think I said too much.

1747
01:36:38,200 --> 01:36:38,950
Doesn't matter.

1748
01:36:39,040 --> 01:36:41,200
Everything is fair
in love and friendship.

1749
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:44,500
Where are you?

1750
01:36:45,120 --> 01:36:48,410
Ritu, the love part is for me, right.

1751
01:36:49,450 --> 01:36:50,660
You first.

1752
01:36:50,870 --> 01:36:52,250
You said it too.

1753
01:36:52,910 --> 01:36:54,750
She really is fast.

1754
01:36:54,910 --> 01:36:56,266
You want to hear it from me, don't you?

1755
01:36:56,290 --> 01:36:59,910
Well, it will be a pretty awkward
situation if I'm in love with Onidda.

1756
01:37:00,200 --> 01:37:02,330
Absolutely right.
But why are you blushing?

1757
01:37:02,410 --> 01:37:04,700
- I am not blushing.
- You are blushing.

1758
01:37:11,330 --> 01:37:13,040
Ghost!

1759
01:37:25,370 --> 01:37:26,500
Lord...

1760
01:37:31,450 --> 01:37:33,790
- You took over the house on day 1.
- Really...

1761
01:37:34,750 --> 01:37:37,370
I wish someone would slap me too...

1762
01:37:37,580 --> 01:37:38,870
I can take it all my life.

1763
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:40,410
You can get lucky too.

1764
01:37:40,500 --> 01:37:43,080
I had chosen a girl for Arjun...

1765
01:37:43,200 --> 01:37:44,426
and they are coming over today.

1766
01:37:44,450 --> 01:37:46,660
I'll tell them that he's a constable.

1767
01:37:46,870 --> 01:37:47,870
You will have to adjust.

1768
01:37:47,950 --> 01:37:50,250
Aunty, its a yes from me.

1769
01:37:55,450 --> 01:37:56,500
Don't want it.

1770
01:38:10,370 --> 01:38:11,580
Patiala...

1771
01:38:16,950 --> 01:38:19,580
Sakool, trying to be over smart?

1772
01:38:19,750 --> 01:38:22,200
You're a bachelor and look at yourself.

1773
01:38:24,620 --> 01:38:28,410
You can kill me,
but don't hurt my feelings.

1774
01:38:28,580 --> 01:38:30,580
Sorry, bro. Sorry.

1775
01:38:31,120 --> 01:38:32,290
- Listen to me.
- Hands up.

1776
01:38:33,500 --> 01:38:34,500
What happened?

1777
01:38:35,160 --> 01:38:36,620
He doesn't know how to.

1778
01:38:39,620 --> 01:38:40,620
Crazy guy...

1779
01:38:43,830 --> 01:38:44,830
Kill him.

1780
01:38:48,450 --> 01:38:50,290
- What are you doing?
- I will show all of you.

1781
01:38:50,330 --> 01:38:53,160
- Are you mad?
- I will show all of you.

1782
01:38:53,450 --> 01:38:55,290
I will show all of you.

1783
01:38:55,370 --> 01:38:57,080
I will kill everyone.

1784
01:39:00,200 --> 01:39:01,250
Get up.

1785
01:39:02,540 --> 01:39:05,290
You will have to get up first.
You are on top of me.

1786
01:39:05,370 --> 01:39:07,450
Put your romance on a hold for now.

1787
01:39:07,580 --> 01:39:11,500
You are going to die today.
Mark my words.

1788
01:39:11,580 --> 01:39:13,580
Your father should know about this.

1789
01:39:13,790 --> 01:39:14,830
There...

1790
01:39:19,200 --> 01:39:20,250
What are you doing?

1791
01:39:21,410 --> 01:39:22,120
How are you, aunty?

1792
01:39:22,200 --> 01:39:23,200
There he goes.

1793
01:39:25,580 --> 01:39:27,000
Let's light the lamps until then.

1794
01:39:33,370 --> 01:39:34,410
Here, light the lamps.

1795
01:39:34,830 --> 01:39:37,160
Don't use too much oil.
It's very expensive.

1796
01:39:37,330 --> 01:39:38,490
- Don't you know.
- Expensive.

1797
01:40:03,700 --> 01:40:06,450
Dadupapa, you're great.

1798
01:40:07,200 --> 01:40:09,540
He finally fired.

1799
01:40:16,910 --> 01:40:18,160
Give me a hug.

1800
01:40:18,450 --> 01:40:20,410
You had to learn to shoot today.

1801
01:40:20,620 --> 01:40:21,750
Hands up.

1802
01:40:22,450 --> 01:40:23,790
Not you.

1803
01:40:26,160 --> 01:40:27,160
Help me up.

1804
01:40:27,450 --> 01:40:29,000
I am never coming back here again.

1805
01:40:33,330 --> 01:40:37,660
These people write Property
Makkar on my posters...

1806
01:40:37,790 --> 01:40:39,410
- Don't spare them.
- Certainly, madam.

1807
01:40:39,500 --> 01:40:41,290
- You must punish them.
- Certainly, madam.

1808
01:40:43,160 --> 01:40:44,160
I am okay.

1809
01:40:44,540 --> 01:40:46,450
- She is very nice.
- I have surrendered.

1810
01:40:46,790 --> 01:40:47,910
Come see me in jail.

1811
01:40:48,200 --> 01:40:49,500
- Let's go.
- Yes, madam.

1812
01:40:49,580 --> 01:40:50,580
Come on.

1813
01:40:50,830 --> 01:40:51,830
Well done, guys.

1814
01:40:52,750 --> 01:40:54,160
Congratulations, Inspector.

1815
01:40:55,080 --> 01:40:55,620
Who could that be now?

1816
01:40:55,790 --> 01:40:58,590
I just solved a case and girls
are already queuing up outside the door.

1817
01:40:58,870 --> 01:41:00,870
Let it ring. I will find a better girl.

1818
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,330
It's possible
that I might learn to fire a gun...

1819
01:41:03,540 --> 01:41:07,250
but you finding a girl.
That's a stupid thing.

1820
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:27,000
What do you think?

1821
01:41:27,250 --> 01:41:28,250
Is it going to work?

1822
01:41:29,580 --> 01:41:30,870
Mind your own business.

1823
01:41:31,370 --> 01:41:32,580
Don't try to be a critique.

1824
01:41:42,580 --> 01:41:44,080
Bless your son.

1825
01:41:47,250 --> 01:41:49,370
He will need time
to find bars in Patiala.

1826
01:41:49,580 --> 01:41:50,790
Great Dadupapa.

1827
01:41:53,410 --> 01:41:56,790
"I feel the world's round."

1828
01:42:00,700 --> 01:42:04,330
"She takes few sips,
but drinks the entire bottle."

1829
01:42:08,250 --> 01:42:11,580
- How many bars?
- Four.

1830
01:42:12,080 --> 01:42:15,290
"She takes few sips,
but drinks the entire bottle."

1831
01:42:15,410 --> 01:42:19,000
Repeat. "Make a neat peg..."

1832
01:42:19,200 --> 01:42:23,040
"and gulps it down."

1833
01:42:23,160 --> 01:42:26,950
"Look at all these alcohol bottles
getting wasted. Who can endure this?"

1834
01:42:28,160 --> 01:42:36,160
"I am gonna take a few sips,
but finish the entire thing."

1835

1836
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:50,200
"Everyone mixes it with something,
but I drink neat."

1837
01:42:50,250 --> 01:42:53,910
"Everyone make way,
because I am high on the beat."

1838
01:42:54,040 --> 01:42:57,540
"I'll finish the entire bottle
and be ready to party."

1839
01:42:57,620 --> 01:43:01,200
"I won't go home, and sleep right here."

1840
01:43:01,290 --> 01:43:02,492
"Open the bottles..."

1841
01:43:02,517 --> 01:43:05,434
Go ahead,
or else you won't be able to sleep.

1842
01:43:05,540 --> 01:43:08,950
"All those scattered around,
bring them closer."

1843
01:43:09,080 --> 01:43:12,250
"I am in a naughty mood..."

1844
01:43:12,330 --> 01:43:16,120
"come on make me do something."

1845
01:43:16,250 --> 01:43:18,660
"I am gonna take a few sips..."

1846
01:43:19,750 --> 01:43:22,410
"I am gonna take a few sips..."

1847
01:43:23,370 --> 01:43:30,870
"I am gonna take a few sips,
but finish the entire thing."

1848
01:43:30,950 --> 01:43:33,410
Get two glasses of water and peanuts.

1849
01:43:36,950 --> 01:43:39,160
"Make a large..."

1850
01:43:39,410 --> 01:43:41,700
"Make a large peg for me."

1851
01:43:41,910 --> 01:43:44,080
"Be my..."

1852
01:43:44,330 --> 01:43:49,200
"Be my sweetheart... forever."

1853
01:43:49,250 --> 01:43:54,120
"And I'll celebrate... like
it's Diwali."

1854
01:43:54,200 --> 01:43:56,540
"Take a good look at me,
and my efforts."

1855
01:43:56,700 --> 01:43:59,080
"Smile on me and change my fate."

1856
01:43:59,200 --> 01:44:01,540
"I am naive and my
intentions are clear."

1857
01:44:01,620 --> 01:44:04,160
"I've been waiting for ages."

1858
01:44:04,200 --> 01:44:06,540
"Make a large..."

1859
01:44:06,790 --> 01:44:08,870
"Make a large peg for me."

1860
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,370
"Be my..."

1861
01:44:11,580 --> 01:44:16,370
"Be my sweetheart... forever."

1862
01:44:16,500 --> 01:44:18,870
"Let's change this relationship..."

1863
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,330
"forever."

1864
01:44:21,410 --> 01:44:23,830
"Make a large..."

1865
01:44:31,200 --> 01:44:33,660
"Make a large..."

1866
01:44:33,870 --> 01:44:36,200
"Make a large peg for me."

1867
01:44:36,250 --> 01:44:38,580
"Be my..."

1868
01:44:38,870 --> 01:44:43,450
"Be my sweetheart... forever."

1869
01:44:43,750 --> 01:44:48,540
"And I'll celebrate... like
it's Diwali."

1870
01:44:48,700 --> 01:44:51,000
"Take a good look at me,
and my efforts."

1871
01:44:51,160 --> 01:44:53,500
"Smile on me and change my fate."

1872
01:44:53,580 --> 01:44:56,160
"I am naive and my
intentions are clear."

1873
01:44:56,200 --> 01:44:58,500
"I've been waiting for ages."

1874
01:44:58,700 --> 01:45:01,000
"Make a large..."

1875
01:45:01,120 --> 01:45:03,330
"Make a large peg for me."

1876
01:45:03,410 --> 01:45:05,910
"Be my..."

1877
01:45:06,040 --> 01:45:10,870
"Be my sweetheart... forever."

1878
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:15,750
"Let's change this relationship..."

1879
01:45:15,910 --> 01:45:19,410
"Make a large..."

1880
01:45:26,870 --> 01:45:28,910
"I've been in love before..."

1881
01:45:29,040 --> 01:45:31,160
"but never anyone like you."

1882
01:45:31,250 --> 01:45:33,370
"Its true, you can ask around."

1883
01:45:33,500 --> 01:45:38,750
"Whether you ask my friends, family,
neighbor or my distant uncle in Canada."

1884
01:45:38,870 --> 01:45:40,950
"Your mother, your sister..."

1885
01:45:41,080 --> 01:45:44,870
"Your sister's friends that
keeps texting me I love you."

1886
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,410
"But I don't respond,
nor do I flaunt."

1887
01:45:47,500 --> 01:45:51,120
"Every morning I pray..."

1888
01:45:51,200 --> 01:45:53,200
"and request for you..."

1889
01:45:53,290 --> 01:45:56,160
"I request to God only for you."

1890
01:45:56,200 --> 01:45:59,700
"Have mercy on me Lord
and make her mine."
