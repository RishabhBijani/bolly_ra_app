1
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,250
Look at our Commander!

2
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:03,040
Seems like he's travelled all the way from
Delhi to Gazni only to eat and sleep!

3
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,210
Shareef Pasha, he has come here to get us...

4
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:09,040
...his intentions are that we attack Delhi together.

5
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,120
Oh Lord, so now the Commander
wants to become the Sultan of Delhi!

6
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:14,600
Revolt against the Sultanate?!

7
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,000
-This is not a rebellion...

8
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,830
...it's all about our desires.

9
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,040
-Yes!

10
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:24,830
How long will we serve the Sultanate?

11
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,510
Now I desire to be the Sultan!

12
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:30,710
Indeed!

13
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:34,870
Who is this insolent fool?

14
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:52,590
Marvellous!

15
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,620
Alauddin! What have you brought?

16
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:16,750
Uncle, you asked me to get it!!

17
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:21,040
When did I ask you to get an ostrich?

18
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,710
I do not remember.

19
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:27,580
But Alauddin never forgets.

20
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:32,620
I respect you so much. You asked for a feather,
I got you an ostrich instead.

21
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:36,000
Feather?
Oh yes! Now I remember...

22
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,040
Now you remember!

23
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:38,240
For my beloved Mehru!

24
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,330
Yes, for Mehru!

25
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:41,040
Mehru!

26
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,830
Mehru!

27
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:45,370
Mehru!

28
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,880
Yes, Father?

29
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,330
Look what I got for you as a gift.

30
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:52,580
Allah! An Ostrich!

31
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:56,080
I really love you a lot, Father!

32
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:57,710
Me too.

33
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:05,370
I'd like to reward you
for fulfilling my daughter's wish.

34
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:08,080
What do you want?

35
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:11,580
I risked my life to fulfill your wish.

36
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,750
Now, I want your life in return!

37
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:18,940
No...no...

38
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:23,390
I want your daughter Mehrunisa to be my wife.

39
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:32,040
Aren't you clever? For one precious
gift you want another in return.

40
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:38,290
Everything precious belongs only to Alauddin.

41
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:39,830
Says who?

42
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,750
Alauddin!

43
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,920
Mehrunisa, daughter of Jalaluddin Khilji...

44
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,710
...do you accept Alauddin Khilji as your husband?

45
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,410
She accepts!

46
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:24,170
Shareef Pasha, where is the groom?

47
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:26,170
Tell him that I've called him.

48
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:28,120
I'll get him right away.

49
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:30,920
Alauddin!

50
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:34,080
Alauddin!

51
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:40,870
What are you doing?
It's your wedding night!

52
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,040
If the Commander finds out,
he will have you beheaded.

53
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:45,920
Who will tell him?

54
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:47,960
You?

55
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,080
You won't tell him.
You are my childhood friend!

56
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,960
My confidante.

57
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:59,040
You will never tell him.

58
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,040
Never.

59
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:05,710
Never.

60
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,520
Allah!

61
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:15,500
Alauddin's greed to possess everything precious,
made Mehru and the skies above shudder with fear.

62
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:19,340
He believed that anything precious
was rightfully his...

63
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:24,040
...but was unaware,
that thousands of miles away across the oceans...

64
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:27,170
...lived the most precious beauty on earth...

65
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,990
...the Princess of Singhal.

66
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:27,940
Your arrow hit it's mark!!

67
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:12,120
-Is anybody out there?

68
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:15,670
Is anybody out there?

69
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,370
Wardhan!

70
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,620
What are you doing here at this hour?

71
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,420
Our state guest, King Ratan Singh of Mewar
had set out on a hunt.

72
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:27,040
It seems he has lost his way in the jungle.

73
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:29,080
The King has given orders to search for him.

74
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:33,120
Inform the King, the guest is safe
and is resting in the caves.

75
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:34,920
I shall.

76
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,540
Everyone back to the Palace!

77
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:45,710
-Do you know what those pearls meant to me?

78
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:48,040
-You could've gifted him a few villages instead.

79
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:49,960
Why did you have to give him that necklace?

80
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,000
What are you trying to say?

81
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,920
I want that necklace back.

82
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:57,500
-It was gifted to you on our wedding
and you gave it away!

83
00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:00,370
Do not worry,
I'll have a similar necklace made for you.

84
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:02,750
Would you cross the ocean for those pearls?

85
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:04,620
-Those pearls were especially brought from Singhal.

86
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,460
-Neither can anyone bring those pearls back...

87
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,810
...nor will I ever get that necklace again.

88
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:38,170
Have you come to apologize?

89
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,290
Your aim is remarkable.

90
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:50,830
You wounded this hunter instead of the deer.
First with your arrow and now with your eyes!

91
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:55,380
Our meeting was a coincidence
but sometimes coincidences are beautiful...

92
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:57,670
...just like this place of yours!

93
00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:00,080
Everything here is so mesmerising.

94
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:08,540
I have been talking for a while,
but we know nothing about each other.

95
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:12,370
You are Ratan Singh, the King of Mewar.

96
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,920
How do you know?

97
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:15,750
Because you are our guest.

98
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:19,460
And that's how you welcome your guest.

99
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,920
What brings you to Singhal?

100
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:23,500
I'm here to buy pearls.

101
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,120
Here, you don't buy pearls.
You find them if you're lucky.

102
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:28,920
Just like I found you.

103
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:31,210
So tell me about yourself.
Who are you?

104
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,660
What is your name?

105
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:37,370
Every leaf here knows my name.

106
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,210
I'm sure you'll find out.

107
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:05,500
She is the Princess of Singhal...

108
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,420
Padmavati.

109
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:11,000
She has been looking after you
for the past two days.

110
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,330
Padmavati.

111
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:21,960
My apologies, King Ratan Singh.

112
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:26,420
Before you could enjoy our hospitality,
you got injured.

113
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:29,120
My daughter made a grave mistake.

114
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:31,710
It was not Padmavati's fault,
King Gandharvasen.

115
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:33,920
I glanced upon her during my hunt.

116
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:37,710
I followed her and the arrow hit me.

117
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,370
I have come to take you back.

118
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,040
Please return to the Palace.

119
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:42,870
I have stayed in palaces all my life.

120
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:45,120
I like the tranquility of the forest.

121
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:48,210
If you don't mind,
I'd like to stay here for a few days more.

122
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:54,040
King Ratan Singh,
you came here as our state guest...

123
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:58,080
...but now you're more like family.

124
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:04,860
I would like you take
pearls back from Singhal and not the wound.

125
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,080
-Pearls from Singhal.

126
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,830
Aren't these the ones you were looking for?

127
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:20,460
What are you thinking?

128
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:25,000
Now that you've got what you wanted,
you'll return to Mewar?

129
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:28,170
I must go back.

130
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,460
You can't leave.

131
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:41,080
Your wound hasn't healed yet.

132
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,720
Would you come with me to Mewar, Padmavati?

133
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:48,830
As my wife!

134
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:26,170
With the blessings of her father,
King Gandharvasen...

135
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:30,250
Princess Padmavati got married to King Ratan Singh
and left for Chittor.

136
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:23,880
-All rise!

137
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:31,250
-King Ratan Singh is arriving in the court.

138
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:07,010
All hail Queen Padmavati!

139
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:09,870
All hail King Ratan Singh!

140
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:20,580
While Chittor celebrated the
arrival of it's new Queen...

141
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:29,960
Jalaluddin revolted against the Delhi Sultanate
and established the Khilji dynasty.

142
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:33,080
He declared himself
the new Sultan of Delhi.

143
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:36,830
Sultan of Delhi, Jalaluddin Khilji...

144
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,210
Glory to him!

145
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:48,040
But Alauddin had his eyes set on
the precious throne of Delhi too.

146
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:53,670
The throne looks beautiful from afar,
but don't be deceived.

147
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:57,790
Along with it comes it's fair share of troubles.

148
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:05,080
We are surrounded by enemies
but the most immediate threat is from the Mongols.

149
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:09,000
Sultan, defeating the Mongols
in battle is impossible.

150
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:11,370
Our army is half their strength.

151
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,500
But our courage is far greater than theirs.

152
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:15,250
So, will you fight the Mongols?

153
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:18,730
For the sake of Khiljis I can even fight God.

154
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:20,670
Well said!

155
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:27,000
Keep your ambitions in check,
lest you get burried under their weight.

156
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:31,780
Pardon me, but there's nothing that can
come in the way of Alauddin's ambitions.

157
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:37,620
I don't want your tall claims,
only victory!

158
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,080
I will fight the Mongols.

159
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,460
Sultan, your belief in me is my victory.

160
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,730
Charge!

161
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:36,240
Alauddin defeated the Mongols
and won Delhi over.

162
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:42,210
Meanwhile, Queen Padmavati was
winning hearts in Chittor.

163
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:51,350
Careful Suraj Baisa. Your days of doingGhoomar (traditional folk dance) are long gone.

164
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:53,040
You might hurt your back.

165
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:58,870
Now the new Queen will perform Ghoomar.

166
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:02,170
My Queen, you must
put up a grand performance.

167
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:06,000
It sure will Suraj Baisa,
because I will play the drums.

168
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:07,640
Greetings, My Queen.

169
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:11,260
Kunwar Baisa, your talkative son
has spoken out of turn again.

170
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,960
Leave alone playing the drums Badal...

171
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:20,290
...no man except the King can be present
during the Queen's performance.

172
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:24,580
Son, you can beat the drums
all you want at your wedding.

173
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:28,670
-All rise for King Ratan Singh.

174
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:34,250
Are they troubling you, My Queen?

175
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:45,120
The Royal Guru is expecting you at the temple.

176
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:51,830
Shall we?

177
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,560
Welcome, My Lord!

178
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:07,080
Padmavati, meet the Royal Guru
and my mentor, Raghav Chetan.

179
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:09,910
He's the answer to all our questions.

180
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:13,780
Please take his blessings.

181
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,490
Your beauty is divine!

182
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:28,700
Not just beauty, but she's also
blessed with great intelligence.

183
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:29,950
Hmm...

184
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:35,160
So what is more important to the new Queen?
Beauty or skill?

185
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:38,530
Careful My Queen, you're being tested!

186
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,330
Please answer his question.

187
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:45,780
Skill.

188
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:47,030
And beauty?

189
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:49,200
That lies in the eye of the beholder.

190
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:50,580
Please explain.

191
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:54,580
Some see God in every object,
while some see God as another object.

192
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:55,620
-Hmm...

193
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:58,700
Describe life in three words.

194
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:02,120
Spirituality, love and sacrifice.

195
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:03,700
What is love?

196
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:08,030
A tear of joy falling from God's eye.

197
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,240
What are tears?

198
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,700
The thin line between sorrow and happiness.

199
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:14,830
What is happiness?

200
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:17,660
An illusion.

201
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:22,110
I hear you're well versed in the art of warfare.

202
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:23,160
Yes.

203
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:26,490
What is the greatest weapon in the battlefield?
-Courage.

204
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:28,580
Which is the most difficult moment in life?

205
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:30,450
Awaiting results after examination.

206
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:32,260
And the biggest gift?

207
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:36,780
Blessings!

208
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:47,480
Come, My Queen.

209
00:27:54,270 --> 00:28:00,330
To grace this occasion...

210
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:06,200
The Queen is arriving.

211
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:12,740
To play a round of Ghoomar...

212
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:18,530
We welcome you our Queen.

213
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:28,750
Join us in a round of Ghoomar.

214
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:31,560
Spin around as we play the Ghoomar.

215
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:34,450
Your beloved is waiting for you too.

216
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:37,660
You blush in a new bride's glow.

217
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:40,950
Your heart skips a beat.

218
00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:46,750
Your anklets tinkle as you walk.

219
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:51,580
Come, My Queen...

220
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:55,030
...let's play a round of Ghoomar!

221
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:58,120
Adorning the veil of love...

222
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:03,150
...she spins in the dance of Ghoomar.

223
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:06,700
Without a care in the world...

224
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:09,900
...she spins in the dance of Ghoomar.

225
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:11,870
Her beloved is the most special.

226
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:18,120
She spins in the dance of Ghoomar.

227
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,410
I am lucky indeed...

228
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:45,700
I went to Singhal looking for pearls and found you.

229
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:48,780
I am lucky too...

230
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:53,780
I was hunting for a deer and found a lion instead.

231
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:58,030
I want to give you every happiness
that you enjoyed in Singhal...

232
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,740
...but I can't give you this one thing...

233
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:06,120
I cannot give you the ocean in this desert.

234
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:10,050
Your eyes are deeper than the ocean.

235
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:17,240
Mewar seems to be growing on you.

236
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:22,110
Mewar has found a place in my heart.

237
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:33,990
What happened?

238
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:36,580
Is someone watching us?

239
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:42,780
Must be the moon,
envious of all your extols.

240
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:11,990
Who could it be?

241
00:34:12,410 --> 00:34:13,700
I smell sandalwood.

242
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,820
And there is only one person in Chittor
who uses this fragrance.

243
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:49,830
Why have I been summoned
at this hour, My Lord?

244
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:52,240
An offender needs to be punished.

245
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,200
Is that all?

246
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:58,160
This could have waited till morning.

247
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:01,950
The crime is serious,
the verdict must be given now.

248
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:05,330
Who is the culprit?

249
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,030
You!

250
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:13,990
The one whose piousness
Mewar vouches for, is a culprit?

251
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:19,030
The one who taught you to be
the King you are today, is a culprit?

252
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:22,530
What is my crime, My Lord?

253
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:30,580
You dared to pry upon the King
when alone with his Queen.

254
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:33,580
This is a lie.
What proof do you have?

255
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:35,590
Sujaan Singh.
- Yes, My Lord.

256
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:45,350
That wound is from my dagger.
And your blood is all the proof one needs.

257
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:49,700
I thought you were my mentor, I believed in you.

258
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:52,910
I thought you were pious, but you
turned out to be a wolf in sheep's guise.

259
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:57,330
I can sentence you to death right now...

260
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,820
...but killing a Brahmin is against my principles.

261
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:06,240
Imprison him. The darkness of the dungeon
might teach him some decency.

262
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:09,030
-Pardon me, My King.
But I would like to say something.

263
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:13,530
When one's piousness is tainted,
he should be distanced from the land.

264
00:36:14,330 --> 00:36:16,490
There's only one punishment for his crime.

265
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,990
Banishment.

266
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,370
I agree with the Queen.

267
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:25,530
You question my piousness?

268
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:43,980
There, I have swallowed this humiliation.

269
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:47,990
But this fire raging in my heart
will reduce Chittor to ashes.

270
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:54,120
Before I leave, won't you
touch my feet and take my blessings?

271
00:36:57,910 --> 00:37:00,410
Sujaan Singh.
-Yes, My Lord.

272
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:20,240
I am going far away from this land.

273
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:23,520
But if I don't bring Mewar down to it knees...

274
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:27,280
...then you may assume,
that Raghav Chetan never existed.

275
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:30,530
He was a mere thought that disappeared in thin air.

276
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:42,200
Uncle, since you gave the dominion of Kara to
Uncle Alauddin, his attitude has completely changed.

277
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:45,410
He attacked Deogiri without your permission...

278
00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:49,910
...and instead of returning to Delhi with the loot,
he rode straight to Kara.

279
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:51,730
I agree with Itaat.

280
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:55,120
He may one day revolt against you.

281
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:58,330
While Alauddin wields
his sword for the Sultanate, My dear...

282
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:02,160
...we sit here and make idle talk.

283
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:05,250
But Uncle, you should be wary of him...

284
00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:09,350
Alauddin is just a tool to fill the coffers of Delhi.
And that's it.

285
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:12,120
I will set sail for Kara tomorrow.

286
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:17,330
And bring back what is rightfully mine.

287
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:19,700
-Glory be to God!

288
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:25,880
Your beauty is so enchanting,
it has turned these shackles to gold.

289
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:31,970
You will be very happy in my harem, Chitai.

290
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:35,740
You're a slave, not a King.

291
00:38:36,170 --> 00:38:38,710
You can never make the Princess of Deogiri happy.

292
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,490
Well said!

293
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:45,280
Such arrogance inspite of all these atrocities!

294
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,410
You have won my heart.

295
00:38:55,490 --> 00:38:56,910
Chief!
-Hmm...

296
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,620
Your plan has succeeded.

297
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:00,030
Splendid!

298
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:03,870
You wanted the Sultan
to come to Kara, and he has.

299
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:10,280
Long live the Khiljis!

300
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,990
-Long live!

301
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,240
Alauddin welcomes the Sultan of Delhi.

302
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:17,200
Stay blessed!

303
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:19,280
I am elated, as well as surprised.

304
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:22,200
What brings you to Kara without prior notice?

305
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:26,370
That's exactly my question to you.

306
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:31,660
Why have you come to Kara
instead of returning to Delhi with the loot?

307
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,330
So the Sultan doesn't trust me anymore?

308
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:39,490
I've won all these treasures only for you.

309
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:42,530
And this stone?

310
00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:45,530
It's precious.

311
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:48,530
A gift I gave myself.

312
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,780
Glory be to God!

313
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:03,740
This precious gem belongs in the Sultan's crown.

314
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:06,700
But don't be disheartened Alauddin.

315
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:11,360
I've brought a precious gift for you too.

316
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,450
This slave!

317
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:22,200
Especially bought for you.

318
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:25,580
He has the guile of a wolf and
the agility of a cheetah.

319
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:31,280
He will serve you in every way possible.

320
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:33,830
You can put him to test.

321
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:34,740
Hmm...

322
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:37,250
What's the name?

323
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:38,700
Malik Kafur, Sire.

324
00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:41,160
Not your's. The perfume you're wearing.

325
00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:43,030
Jannat-ul-Firdaus.

326
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:46,240
What can you do for me?

327
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:48,030
Anything.

328
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:51,160
I can give my life for you.

329
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:52,950
Can you take a life for me?

330
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:55,330
Yes, Sire.
-Hmm.

331
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,830
Then kill these men.

332
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:01,100
Kill them?

333
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:06,480
They are my ministers!

334
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:17,540
Jokes apart.
I want you to march South with your army.

335
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,490
Anything else, Sire?

336
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:38,030
What have you done?

337
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:39,970
You wanted me to put him to test.

338
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:43,790
Uncle, I am really pleased with your gift.

339
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:48,410
But don't be disheartened.
I have a gift for you too.

340
00:41:48,490 --> 00:41:49,530
Ikhtiyaar!

341
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:51,180
My dearest Uncle!

342
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:57,240
Long live the Khiljis!!

343
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,620
Long live!

344
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:48,370
So finally you did revolt against the Sultanate?

345
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:55,650
History will never forgive you for
murdering my Uncle.

346
00:42:55,730 --> 00:42:59,530
What will history say Amir Khusrau?

347
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:02,030
History will term it the need of the hour.

348
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,950
You're absolutely right.

349
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:06,700
Itaat, my boy...

350
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:12,430
...the Sultanate needs fresh blood to expand
it's frontiers and to keep it's people happy.

351
00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:16,370
And that is why I have seized the throne.

352
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:23,650
And now, Jalaluddin Khilji should be
buried in a manner befitting a Sultan.

353
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:47,830
Sultan of Delhi, Alauddin Khilji...

354
00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:49,660
Long live!

355
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:52,740
Sultan of Delhi, Alauddin Khilji...

356
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:55,200
Long live!

357
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:09,870
I am the new Sultan!

358
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:16,780
This is the precious stone which
your father took from me...

359
00:44:16,870 --> 00:44:18,740
...and today I took away his throne.

360
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:22,490
It's the tradition of every Sultanate.

361
00:44:23,770 --> 00:44:28,660
There's one more tradition,
to bow before the Sultan.

362
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,160
Hmm...

363
00:44:31,990 --> 00:44:33,370
No...no...

364
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:36,700
Stand up.

365
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:47,200
May the Sultan's glory prevail.

366
00:44:49,950 --> 00:44:51,950
Why do you look upset?

367
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:55,910
You're now the Empress of India!

368
00:44:56,410 --> 00:44:57,950
And your husband...

369
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:00,410
See.

370
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:01,660
See what?

371
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:03,660
This crown?

372
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:07,870
I've seen it many a times before,
on my father's head.

373
00:45:08,390 --> 00:45:10,490
This crown is unfaithful.

374
00:45:12,030 --> 00:45:13,660
Always changing heads.

375
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:18,200
From your father's head to mine.
And now on yours!

376
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:30,050
On this joyous occasion,
make unabashed love to your Sultan.

377
00:45:31,990 --> 00:45:33,950
Now!

378
00:46:04,870 --> 00:46:05,740
Kafur!

379
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:08,830
Malik Kafur!

380
00:46:09,030 --> 00:46:10,200
Yes, Sire!

381
00:46:15,990 --> 00:46:16,870
Yes, Sire?

382
00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:19,490
Can you hear these strains of flute,
or is it just me?

383
00:46:19,690 --> 00:46:20,950
I do hear it.

384
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:23,990
Who is playing the flute at this hour?

385
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:25,880
Should I silence him for good?

386
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:30,780
No. His notes are precious.
Bring him to me tomorrow.

387
00:46:30,990 --> 00:46:31,910
Yes, Sire.

388
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:35,300
Any other service?

389
00:46:59,970 --> 00:47:01,260
Exquisite!

390
00:47:01,510 --> 00:47:03,010
Ethereal!

391
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:08,110
I can conquer everything precious,
except for your talent.

392
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:12,970
What did you say your name was?
Raghav Chetan.

393
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:17,640
Whoever you are.
Wherever you've come from...

394
00:47:18,970 --> 00:47:21,470
...now on you will be the pride of my court.

395
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:24,890
What are you looking at?

396
00:47:24,970 --> 00:47:26,290
Your past!

397
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:30,980
Ostrich feathers smeared with blood.

398
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:34,840
A red stone studded crown.

399
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:38,280
A crown that will rule the world!

400
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,340
Alexander the Great!

401
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:43,450
You will be the next Alexander!

402
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:50,050
But this is only possible when she is with you.

403
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:51,590
Who?

404
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:54,180
She's an illusion!

405
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:57,850
A creation of God.
Her face glows like moonlight.

406
00:48:00,390 --> 00:48:03,010
Her luminous beauty radiates far and beyond.

407
00:48:03,470 --> 00:48:06,550
She is the essence of life.

408
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:10,930
A mere glimpse of her shadow
would make you desire her.

409
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:13,820
Such beauty can exist only in dreams.

410
00:48:19,490 --> 00:48:24,490
I assure you. One look at her and you'll
never be able to get her off your mind.

411
00:48:25,430 --> 00:48:28,050
She will change your destiny.

412
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:29,970
If you win her over...

413
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:32,090
...Mewar will be yours!

414
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:33,970
India will be yours!

415
00:48:34,470 --> 00:48:36,490
The world will be at your feet,
even paradise!

416
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:39,260
Without her, you'll have nothing.

417
00:48:40,270 --> 00:48:42,510
Whatever she touches, turns to gold!

418
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:46,180
She will make you immortal!

419
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:49,970
She is the most precious.
But just as impossible to possess.

420
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:52,720
What's the name of Alauddin's destiny?

421
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:56,070
The Queen of Chittor, Padmavati.

422
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:01,790
Padmavati!

423
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:07,440
Greetings to King Ratan Singh of Mewar
from the Sultan of Delhi.

424
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:11,890
I send this invitation to you
on the occasion of my birthday.

425
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:14,800
Please grace the event along with your family.

426
00:49:14,890 --> 00:49:20,020
Share a meal and enjoy our hospitality.

427
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:22,580
So that like other kings...

428
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:27,550
...you and Mewar stay protected under the sovereignty
of Sikandar-e-Sani (Alexander-the-Second).

429
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:31,760
Your well-wisher, the Sultan of Delhi, Alauddin Khilji.

430
00:49:33,590 --> 00:49:35,090
Read it once again.

431
00:49:41,230 --> 00:49:43,950
Greetings from the Sultan...

432
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:57,760
Please inform your Sultan, we have more steel
in our nerves than in his entire armoury.

433
00:49:59,050 --> 00:50:01,430
We're safe without his refuge.

434
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:07,010
Long live the Khiljis.
-Hmm.

435
00:50:07,330 --> 00:50:11,420
Sultan, The King of Chittor
has declined your invitation.

436
00:50:16,070 --> 00:50:18,260
Then summon the troops and declare war.

437
00:50:18,870 --> 00:50:20,680
You should fear God, Sultan.

438
00:50:20,930 --> 00:50:22,680
Padmavati is someone's wife.

439
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:27,220
Malik Kafur, ask the Empress
what will she serve for dinner.

440
00:50:28,230 --> 00:50:30,390
Venison, Kabuli pulao,
korma, aloo bukhara, shahi...

441
00:50:30,470 --> 00:50:32,970
With a feast like that
I've no appetite left for fear.

442
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:34,390
Hmm?

443
00:50:38,050 --> 00:50:42,390
It's hard to believe,Sikandar-e-Sani will wage war for a woman.

444
00:50:42,470 --> 00:50:45,510
I am done extending my boundaries.
It's time to extend my arms.

445
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:49,430
A war in the name of beauty!

446
00:51:09,090 --> 00:51:10,180
What's the matter Tejveer?

447
00:51:10,770 --> 00:51:13,140
Why have you rushed to the fort from the frontier?

448
00:51:13,890 --> 00:51:14,970
I have a message.

449
00:51:15,050 --> 00:51:19,570
Sultan Alauddin Khilji and his army
are on their way to attack Chittor.

450
00:52:23,510 --> 00:52:25,570
The Khilji army will reach Chittor soon, My Lord.

451
00:52:25,650 --> 00:52:28,510
I know. We will welcome them
in true Rajput manner.

452
00:52:28,910 --> 00:52:32,390
Alert the troops
and fill the granaries with supplies.

453
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:35,140
But the people are scared.
-There is nothing to fear.

454
00:52:35,470 --> 00:52:39,180
Gather all women and children from the villages
and bring them inside the fort.

455
00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:42,550
Send a message to all the neighbouring Kingdoms...

456
00:52:42,630 --> 00:52:45,550
...that if we all unite, Alauddin can be defeated.

457
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:47,590
Otherwise, he will annihilate us one by one.

458
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:48,720
Yes, My Lord!

459
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:22,760
My Lord?

460
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:27,040
Attack!

461
00:53:51,260 --> 00:53:54,240
Malik! Now this war is justified.

462
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:56,180
Absolutely, Sultan.

463
00:53:58,290 --> 00:54:01,050
Commander Ulugh Khan, what is your opinion?
Should we send some of our troops?

464
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:01,930
Certainly, Sire.

465
00:54:02,010 --> 00:54:06,720
But Ulugh Khan, it's impossible
to scale the walls of Chittor.

466
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:09,640
Whoever tried, has only faced defeat.

467
00:54:09,890 --> 00:54:13,010
Khiljis have never accepted defeat.

468
00:54:13,990 --> 00:54:16,470
Send some troops before sunset.

469
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:19,640
Let's gauge the ability of these Rajputs.

470
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:42,640
I don't understand their tactic of
sending a handful of soldiers, My Lord.

471
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:45,590
With your permission, should we engage them?

472
00:54:46,010 --> 00:54:47,900
Let them come.

473
00:55:27,130 --> 00:55:28,890
You summoned me, Sultan?

474
00:55:29,790 --> 00:55:32,930
It's time to kill you!

475
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:36,180
Our decision to attack was not correct.

476
00:55:36,970 --> 00:55:38,510
I had warned Ulugh Khan...

477
00:55:38,590 --> 00:55:44,220
Let the universe be warned, the Rajput Sun
will soon be eclipsed by the Khilji Crescent.

478
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:45,510
Pardon me, Sultan.

479
00:55:46,050 --> 00:55:49,010
But passion isn't enough
to break down the walls of Chittor.

480
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:59,470
This passion is what helped me
conquer half of India.

481
00:55:59,550 --> 00:56:01,430
The walls of Chittor cannot stop me.

482
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,380
But the real question is...

483
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:07,990
...if Padmavati doesn't turn out
to be as precious then...

484
00:56:09,970 --> 00:56:13,790
...the number of soldiers that have died today...

485
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:18,570
I'll cut you into the same number of pieces!

486
00:56:20,430 --> 00:56:24,970
The Sultan is getting hungry.
Bring me food.

487
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:37,360
-Looks like Alauddin has set up
all of Delhi here, My Lord!

488
00:56:38,410 --> 00:56:42,430
This is his strategy.
Show your might and shatter the enemy's morale.

489
00:56:43,430 --> 00:56:44,970
When is Diwali (Festival of Lights)?

490
00:56:45,050 --> 00:56:46,390
Next week, My Lord.

491
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:49,680
This year's Diwali celebrations
will be so grand...

492
00:56:49,910 --> 00:56:52,260
...that they will lose half the battle
watching us rejoice.

493
00:56:52,690 --> 00:56:53,550
Yes, My Lord.

494
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:49,910
Queen, why are you sitting here all alone?

495
00:57:51,310 --> 00:57:54,930
All of Chittor is celebrating Diwali.
Everyone's looking for you.

496
00:57:55,230 --> 00:57:57,180
They have lost their minds!

497
00:57:57,970 --> 00:58:02,220
The enemy has us surrounded
and we're celebrating Diwali!

498
00:58:02,540 --> 00:58:04,510
Why do you think of them as our enemy?

499
00:58:05,830 --> 00:58:08,970
Think of them as the new guards of Chittor.

500
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:15,450
They can't leave, or come inside,
but can only stand guard.

501
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:25,720
Long live the Khiljis!
-Hmm.

502
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:28,720
Sultan, if you're busy we'll come back later.

503
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:32,220
No, these are some historical records.

504
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:35,680
I was burning the ones
that don't mention my name.

505
00:58:36,350 --> 00:58:38,330
Some of these are
written by you too Khusrau.

506
00:58:38,410 --> 00:58:40,010
But Sire...

507
00:58:40,090 --> 00:58:45,390
I want history to remember only me!

508
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:50,930
Ulugh Khan, have you cut off all
supplies of food and water to Chittor?

509
00:58:51,010 --> 00:58:51,550
Yes, Sire.

510
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:53,820
Did you block their secret tunnels?
-Yes.

511
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:56,180
And plundered the neighbouring villages?
-Yes, Sire.

512
00:58:56,720 --> 00:59:04,840
Now send a message to all the Rajput kings
that helping Mewar will invite the Sultan's wrath.

513
00:59:05,140 --> 00:59:06,180
Yes, Sire.

514
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:07,430
Dismissed.

515
00:59:07,690 --> 00:59:13,140
Sultan, it's been days since any combat.
The soldiers are getting restless.

516
00:59:13,220 --> 00:59:14,800
But the war is on!

517
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:20,300
Between their hunger and our patience.

518
00:59:21,670 --> 00:59:26,090
But we must motivate our soldiers.
Keep them entertained.

519
00:59:27,990 --> 00:59:29,140
Wrestling!

520
00:59:30,340 --> 00:59:31,890
Announce a wrestling bout.

521
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:34,220
I will also fight tomorrow.

522
00:59:36,470 --> 00:59:38,760
Let's wrestle!

523
01:00:31,550 --> 01:00:35,430
Sultan!

524
01:00:39,310 --> 01:00:43,010
Hunting games in the morning,
wrestling in the evening...

525
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:45,140
Music and debauchery at night!

526
01:00:45,970 --> 01:00:49,170
It's a unique way to keep the army's spirits up.

527
01:00:50,030 --> 01:00:51,590
But you must consider, Sultan...

528
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:55,720
It's been two months since
we've been away from Delhi.

529
01:00:56,030 --> 01:00:58,430
But we're getting closer to Padmavati.

530
01:01:00,270 --> 01:01:02,000
Like the beauties of Egypt...

531
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:10,140
...here's a celestial beauty too
whose heart beats for you.

532
01:01:31,550 --> 01:01:42,140
In the land where beauty lies,
beats a heart that yearns for love.

533
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:58,010
I feel a deep burning desire within.

534
01:03:49,610 --> 01:03:51,050
What news have you brought Sujaan Singh?

535
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:52,970
When are the troops of other Kingdoms arriving?

536
01:03:53,050 --> 01:03:58,050
Every Kingdom has refused to support us.

537
01:03:58,620 --> 01:04:01,010
No one wants enmity with Alauddin.

538
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:03,140
What should we do now Gora Singh?

539
01:04:09,820 --> 01:04:12,640
Declare war.

540
01:04:16,890 --> 01:04:20,050
My Lord, please reconsider.

541
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:24,040
The decision is made.
Chittor will fight it's own battle.

542
01:05:06,990 --> 01:05:08,200
Sultan!

543
01:05:10,010 --> 01:05:11,010
Sultan!

544
01:05:11,470 --> 01:05:13,920
Wake up, Sultan!

545
01:05:14,340 --> 01:05:16,420
The Rajputs have set all our camps on fire!

546
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:19,560
Then put out the fire.
Wake me up when it is done.

547
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:22,220
Let's go, Sultan...
-You fool, my birds!

548
01:05:22,300 --> 01:05:24,050
They are precious!
They shouldn't be harmed.

549
01:05:24,970 --> 01:05:27,010
Stop joking...

550
01:05:33,470 --> 01:05:36,340
Here are your cages!

551
01:06:08,330 --> 01:06:10,140
Long live the Khiljis.

552
01:06:11,750 --> 01:06:14,010
The troops are growing restless, Sultan.

553
01:06:14,690 --> 01:06:19,960
Our camps, food and other
reserves have burnt to ashes.

554
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:23,470
The troops are dying of thirst.

555
01:06:25,010 --> 01:06:31,840
I have a request to make, Sire.
If you could meet with the troops once.

556
01:06:33,460 --> 01:06:36,890
Your army is on the verge of mutiny.

557
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:56,180
We won't stay here any longer.

558
01:06:56,260 --> 01:06:59,530
We will go back to Delhi!

559
01:07:02,850 --> 01:07:05,180
Whoever wants to go back, step forward.

560
01:07:05,340 --> 01:07:08,510
Embrace your Sultan and return to Delhi.

561
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:12,200
Ulugh Khan?

562
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:46,010
We Khiljis saw a dream together.

563
01:07:46,630 --> 01:07:50,390
That one day our flag
will soar all over the world.

564
01:07:50,930 --> 01:07:55,640
We swore to stand by each other,
come what may.

565
01:07:57,090 --> 01:08:03,760
And during these troubled times,
you want to give up!

566
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:08,680
Then forget our dream!

567
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:22,970
Long live the Khiljis.
-Long live!

568
01:08:29,890 --> 01:08:33,720
Sikandar-e-Sani...
-Long live!

569
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:53,890
My Lord, Greetings on Holi (Festival of Colours)!

570
01:08:54,090 --> 01:08:56,430
Wish you the same.

571
01:08:56,760 --> 01:08:58,640
I am just returning from the granary.

572
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:00,390
We only have a few days' supply left.

573
01:09:00,550 --> 01:09:02,680
But this should remain only between us.

574
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:05,390
Our people shouldn't know.

575
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:07,590
Our difficulties are growing, My Lord.

576
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:10,050
Difficulties will also grow for our enemy.

577
01:09:11,300 --> 01:09:15,050
This scorching heat will force
Alauddin to retreat.

578
01:09:15,930 --> 01:09:17,430
Just a few more days.

579
01:09:17,890 --> 01:09:22,390
Please enjoy Holi. I'll go and wish
the new Queen on her first Holi here.

580
01:09:25,230 --> 01:09:26,930
Please don't ignore the reality, My Lord.

581
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:28,590
This is a matter of grave concern.

582
01:09:30,930 --> 01:09:32,550
You seem to have forgotten, Gora Singh.

583
01:09:33,380 --> 01:09:37,090
One who braves any situation, is a Rajput.

584
01:09:38,140 --> 01:09:42,720
One who dares to walk
on burning embers, is a Rajput.

585
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:47,270
One who accepts all challenges and
emerges victorious, is a Rajput.

586
01:09:47,930 --> 01:09:55,550
The one who fights the enemy
till his last breath, is a Rajput.

587
01:09:56,890 --> 01:09:57,970
Sultan!

588
01:10:01,210 --> 01:10:03,260
These people have lost their minds!

589
01:10:03,530 --> 01:10:07,720
They celebrate despite the siege.
I see colours flying from the fort!

590
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:12,230
-Colours are bound to fly in Chittor.
Today is Holi!

591
01:10:13,070 --> 01:10:15,840
People colour each other and express their love.

592
01:10:15,930 --> 01:10:18,180
And even embrace their enemies?

593
01:10:18,590 --> 01:10:19,550
Yes, Sire.

594
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:22,140
Then let me play with the enemy too!

595
01:10:22,350 --> 01:10:24,710
With colours or blood?

596
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:34,390
Before this weather turns against us,
send a message of truce to the fort.

597
01:10:35,720 --> 01:10:37,470
Truce with Chittor?

598
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:40,430
Why did your face turn pale?
-Absolutely not!

599
01:10:41,140 --> 01:10:42,010
I will deliver this message...

600
01:10:42,090 --> 01:10:44,840
Not you, Malik Kafur will go.

601
01:10:45,430 --> 01:10:46,010
As you wish.

602
01:10:46,090 --> 01:10:48,550
So today is Holi!

603
01:10:48,850 --> 01:10:51,090
Someone colour me too.

604
01:11:40,220 --> 01:11:47,800
The Festival of Colours is here.

605
01:11:57,260 --> 01:12:00,550
I will play Holi with my beloved.

606
01:12:00,630 --> 01:12:04,800
And colour him with my love.

607
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:55,010
Chief, look!

608
01:13:58,930 --> 01:14:01,100
Should I knock him down?

609
01:14:01,510 --> 01:14:03,010
Let him come, Badal.

610
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:17,560
This is Malik Kafur, My Lord.

611
01:14:17,930 --> 01:14:21,260
Alauddin's most trusted.
Some even call him his consort.

612
01:14:25,470 --> 01:14:28,760
Greetings to King Ratan Singh
from the Sultan of Delhi.

613
01:14:29,470 --> 01:14:35,140
I've understood that the Rajputs of Mewar
don't bow their heads or swords.

614
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:38,260
Your determination is truly commendable.

615
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:41,180
I would like to extend my
hand in friendship towards you.

616
01:14:41,810 --> 01:14:47,140
Before returning to Delhi, I would like to
experience Chittor's hospitality.

617
01:14:48,180 --> 01:14:52,850
I hope you will accept my message of truce.

618
01:14:54,510 --> 01:14:56,260
I will definitely meet Alauddin.

619
01:14:56,510 --> 01:14:59,810
Marvellous!
The Sultan will be very pleased!

620
01:15:00,260 --> 01:15:02,140
But before we meet,
I have certain conditions.

621
01:15:02,430 --> 01:15:04,010
We accept all your conditions.

622
01:15:04,430 --> 01:15:06,160
At least listen to the conditions.

623
01:15:16,850 --> 01:15:20,890
This proposition could be a conspiracy.

624
01:15:23,470 --> 01:15:24,890
Could be.

625
01:15:26,300 --> 01:15:29,430
Then why invite the Sultan to the fort?

626
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:33,060
I accepted his proposal and rejected it as well.

627
01:15:33,140 --> 01:15:35,310
How is that?
-I proposed two conditions.

628
01:15:35,470 --> 01:15:37,890
First, his army must return to Delhi.

629
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:45,560
Second, if he would like to meet me,
he must come to the fort alone and unarmed.

630
01:15:45,680 --> 01:15:48,100
What if he accepts your conditions?

631
01:15:49,150 --> 01:15:52,510
A man who came all the way from Delhi
and spent six months in the scorching heat...

632
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:54,260
...would definitely accept your conditions.

633
01:15:55,260 --> 01:15:56,310
I don't think so.

634
01:15:56,680 --> 01:15:59,970
Lord Ram too never thought that
Raavan will come disguised as a sage.

635
01:16:05,380 --> 01:16:07,930
Greetings, My Lord.
Pardon me for my untimely interruption.

636
01:16:08,010 --> 01:16:09,140
What is it Gora Singh?

637
01:16:09,220 --> 01:16:11,010
The Sultan has sent a message.

638
01:16:11,420 --> 01:16:13,100
He has accepted both our conditions.

639
01:16:18,390 --> 01:16:19,680
Let him come.

640
01:16:32,510 --> 01:16:36,260
Prayer chants...

641
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:42,810
Is the army ready to return to Delhi?

642
01:16:43,010 --> 01:16:45,810
Is the Sultan really sending
the army away from Chittor?

643
01:16:45,890 --> 01:16:49,390
Away from Chittor's sight
but not from their land!

644
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:50,930
Pardon me, Sultan.

645
01:16:51,010 --> 01:16:54,720
But entering the enemy's fort
unarmed can be dangerous.

646
01:17:09,640 --> 01:17:10,640
Danger!

647
01:17:17,430 --> 01:17:18,890
I accept!

648
01:17:21,310 --> 01:17:25,970
Every danger that takes Alauddin closer to Padmavati.

649
01:17:28,350 --> 01:17:30,010
I accept.

650
01:17:36,220 --> 01:17:37,720
I accept.

651
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:57,810
By the way Sultan,
Delhi's throne is in danger too.

652
01:17:58,140 --> 01:17:59,560
Itaat Khan!

653
01:18:00,470 --> 01:18:05,720
His eyes are full of hatred for you
and greed for the throne.

654
01:18:06,680 --> 01:18:08,350
He wants to be the next Sultan.

655
01:18:21,810 --> 01:18:27,930
Every star wants to be the moon
but never succeeds.

656
01:18:28,010 --> 01:18:34,560
Like I am so close to you,
but can never take Padmavati's place.

657
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:41,040
Queen Padmavati!

658
01:21:03,560 --> 01:21:05,600
Welcome to the fort, Sultan.

659
01:21:05,680 --> 01:21:08,010
King Ratan Singh!

660
01:21:08,890 --> 01:21:11,680
Pardon me, but I am the Commander of Mewar's army.

661
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:14,640
Gora Singh.

662
01:21:15,220 --> 01:21:18,970
So where is your King Ratan Singh hiding?

663
01:21:19,060 --> 01:21:21,180
He's waiting for you inside.

664
01:21:54,760 --> 01:21:59,390
I feel elated today!

665
01:22:00,390 --> 01:22:03,680
I feel on top of the world today!

666
01:22:08,180 --> 01:22:08,970
Wonderful!

667
01:22:09,390 --> 01:22:12,970
Pardon me, but I am overwhelmed to see you.

668
01:22:14,140 --> 01:22:17,680
After months of waiting,
we finally meet!

669
01:22:17,930 --> 01:22:22,930
Now that you're here,
how would you like to be welcomed?

670
01:22:23,100 --> 01:22:24,810
Like a dear friend!

671
01:22:36,220 --> 01:22:37,850
I've got you a precious gift!

672
01:22:38,140 --> 01:22:41,350
You're gifting a sword to a friend?

673
01:22:41,890 --> 01:22:46,390
It was one of your conditions, wasn't it?
To come alone and unarmed.

674
01:22:47,770 --> 01:22:50,390
Here. Now I am unarmed.

675
01:22:54,470 --> 01:22:56,140
I've heard it's very beautiful...

676
01:22:57,390 --> 01:22:59,770
...the Fort of Chittor!

677
01:23:00,460 --> 01:23:03,640
God has truly blessed Rajputs with abundance.

678
01:23:03,970 --> 01:23:06,430
Abundant skills! Such grandeur!

679
01:23:07,350 --> 01:23:09,310
And an unmatched enemy too!

680
01:23:12,310 --> 01:23:13,100
Shall we?

681
01:23:22,430 --> 01:23:25,430
Prayer before meal.

682
01:24:11,260 --> 01:24:12,560
-Your move.

683
01:24:14,100 --> 01:24:14,760
Sultan!

684
01:24:14,850 --> 01:24:15,810
Hmm...

685
01:24:19,850 --> 01:24:24,890
Careful King.
Your Queen is in danger!

686
01:24:32,720 --> 01:24:33,760
There...

687
01:24:35,730 --> 01:24:37,560
I saved my Queen.

688
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:38,720
Hmm...

689
01:24:38,810 --> 01:24:39,970
What are you looking at?

690
01:24:40,260 --> 01:24:42,180
It's almost sundown.

691
01:24:42,260 --> 01:24:45,520
I guess Chittor and Delhi will have to
reconcile in this game as well!

692
01:24:48,440 --> 01:24:50,180
Well then, allow me to take your leave.

693
01:24:50,350 --> 01:24:51,140
As you please.

694
01:24:53,060 --> 01:24:55,260
But before I leave you must
introduce me to your family.

695
01:24:55,720 --> 01:24:58,970
I've introduced you to everyone.
This is my family.

696
01:24:59,060 --> 01:25:00,100
Yes, of course they are.

697
01:25:00,180 --> 01:25:02,760
But I was referring to the
pride of Chittor...

698
01:25:03,930 --> 01:25:05,000
Queen Padmavati.

699
01:25:08,310 --> 01:25:12,100
What's wrong?
Was my request unreasonable?

700
01:25:14,180 --> 01:25:17,430
That was a disgraceful thing to say Alauddin.

701
01:25:18,470 --> 01:25:23,970
We treat our guests like God in Chittor,
otherwise you would be beheaded right away!

702
01:25:31,220 --> 01:25:34,310
Now the King is in danger too!

703
01:25:36,220 --> 01:25:37,140
Check.

704
01:25:48,930 --> 01:25:53,010
Reconsider your decision, My Queen.

705
01:25:53,220 --> 01:25:56,140
I will never agree to this.
This is wrong.

706
01:25:56,840 --> 01:25:59,220
My decision is right for Mewar, Kunwar Baisa.

707
01:25:59,540 --> 01:26:01,220
But, the King...

708
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:08,060
Which decision of yours is right?

709
01:26:08,850 --> 01:26:11,560
-I am aware...
-You may be the Queen of Mewar but...

710
01:26:11,640 --> 01:26:13,560
...you have no right to take political decisions.

711
01:26:13,640 --> 01:26:14,850
It is my right!

712
01:26:15,350 --> 01:26:19,720
Especially, if I am the reason
for Chittor to go to war.

713
01:26:19,810 --> 01:26:22,760
So let there be a war!
We will fight them in the battlefield.

714
01:26:23,930 --> 01:26:27,310
But never make the mistake of taking
these decisions yourself.

715
01:26:28,140 --> 01:26:29,680
Never, My Queen.

716
01:26:31,260 --> 01:26:33,100
You made a mistake too.

717
01:26:35,100 --> 01:26:37,510
When you drew your sword,
you should've beheaded him.

718
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:39,970
You had your opportunity to change history.

719
01:26:41,220 --> 01:26:42,930
What are you saying, My Queen?

720
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:47,350
You know that I could've never struck
an unarmed guest in the fort.

721
01:26:48,140 --> 01:26:49,430
Even if it's the Devil himself.

722
01:26:50,850 --> 01:26:55,010
History can turn its page
but Rajputs don't budge from their principles.

723
01:27:03,010 --> 01:27:05,510
Then take your sword and behead me.

724
01:27:07,390 --> 01:27:09,560
Rajput principles and honour
will remain intact.

725
01:27:09,640 --> 01:27:13,470
No one will ever understand
your decision of showing him your face.

726
01:27:13,680 --> 01:27:15,180
Future generations will hold you accountable.

727
01:27:15,260 --> 01:27:16,560
So let them.

728
01:27:17,720 --> 01:27:21,760
If I can save even one life by showing my face,
then I accept this humiliation.

729
01:27:24,290 --> 01:27:27,140
Let me fulfill my duties as the Queen.

730
01:27:33,060 --> 01:27:35,430
Wait here.
The King shall join you shortly.

731
01:27:36,100 --> 01:27:37,060
Here?

732
01:27:40,860 --> 01:27:43,720
Lord Shiva drank poison
to save the world.

733
01:27:44,200 --> 01:27:47,260
Today you're taking this
difficult decision for Mewar.

734
01:27:48,060 --> 01:27:49,970
Keep this with you, My Queen.

735
01:27:50,260 --> 01:27:52,970
This holy smoke will protect you
from the Sultan's evil-eye.

736
01:27:55,930 --> 01:27:57,180
King Ratan Singh!

737
01:27:57,640 --> 01:28:00,390
A thought crossed my mind while waiting...

738
01:28:03,850 --> 01:28:05,310
Gora Singh...

739
01:28:06,850 --> 01:28:08,100
Yes, My Lord.

740
01:28:35,460 --> 01:28:37,100
You may leave, Alauddin.

741
01:28:41,140 --> 01:28:44,350
Yes, I can.

742
01:28:46,350 --> 01:28:53,100
But before I return to Delhi,
allow me to show you my hospitality as well.

743
01:28:55,100 --> 01:28:56,140
Tomorrow.

744
01:28:57,390 --> 01:28:58,560
I'll be waiting.

745
01:29:20,810 --> 01:29:22,220
Keep your sword with you.

746
01:29:23,310 --> 01:29:25,930
I've been invited for a meal,
not for battle.

747
01:29:26,720 --> 01:29:30,100
A storm is expected outside.
Think about this again.

748
01:29:31,140 --> 01:29:32,430
Do you have to go?

749
01:29:32,640 --> 01:29:37,180
Would you like history to remember that
Alauddin Khilji came to Chittor unarmed...

750
01:29:37,890 --> 01:29:40,890
...but King Ratan Singh
was too scared to venture out.

751
01:29:41,180 --> 01:29:43,010
I understand your concern.

752
01:29:43,850 --> 01:29:45,970
But he is all alone.
His army has gone back.

753
01:29:47,100 --> 01:29:48,890
But it can come back too.

754
01:29:54,910 --> 01:29:56,930
I shall be back before the moon rises.

755
01:29:57,810 --> 01:29:58,430
Hmm.

756
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:43,160
Sultan!

757
01:30:44,810 --> 01:30:45,510
Oh...

758
01:30:47,310 --> 01:30:50,100
Welcome, my friend!

759
01:30:50,540 --> 01:30:52,600
I thought you might not
show up in this storm.

760
01:30:52,890 --> 01:30:55,100
Storms like these can never stop me.

761
01:30:55,350 --> 01:30:56,720
Of course!

762
01:30:58,810 --> 01:30:59,850
Take a seat.

763
01:31:01,060 --> 01:31:01,640
Here?

764
01:31:01,720 --> 01:31:02,640
Yes.

765
01:31:05,680 --> 01:31:09,350
Today is my last day in Chittor.
I am overwhelmed.

766
01:31:09,850 --> 01:31:10,720
Hmm...

767
01:31:11,330 --> 01:31:13,140
I have so many memories of this place.

768
01:31:13,220 --> 01:31:19,680
Many of my soldiers died here,
right before my eyes.

769
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:22,760
Do you remember?

770
01:31:23,260 --> 01:31:25,510
The day you stood watching from the fort.

771
01:31:27,890 --> 01:31:29,140
Poor men!

772
01:31:30,470 --> 01:31:31,930
Poor Dilnawaz!!

773
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:34,970
My precious little bird!

774
01:31:36,720 --> 01:31:42,640
The day you burnt our tents,
he too perished in that fire.

775
01:31:44,660 --> 01:31:50,600
Had he been alive, you would have
heard his screams in this storm.

776
01:31:56,080 --> 01:31:58,140
Anyway...

777
01:32:00,870 --> 01:32:04,600
I feel a strange connection to this soil.

778
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:07,930
I want to take it back with me...

779
01:32:10,060 --> 01:32:11,830
...and you too!

780
01:32:24,680 --> 01:32:27,560
So this is the Khilji hospitality?

781
01:32:28,190 --> 01:32:29,560
Your principles?

782
01:32:31,170 --> 01:32:34,720
I made a mistake
of trusting you again Alauddin.

783
01:32:35,220 --> 01:32:39,140
Even God doesn't trust Alauddin!

784
01:32:42,010 --> 01:32:43,680
You broke my trust too!

785
01:32:44,520 --> 01:32:47,430
You dropped the curtains so quick that
I couldn't even see the Queen's face.

786
01:32:48,420 --> 01:32:50,890
Now please don't refuse to come with me.

787
01:32:51,510 --> 01:32:54,390
Because you're the bait that will
draw Queen Padmavati to Delhi.

788
01:32:54,470 --> 01:32:58,720
And if that doesn't happen,
I will take Chittor away from you.

789
01:32:59,010 --> 01:33:01,010
You will take away Chittor?

790
01:33:01,890 --> 01:33:05,220
You can take me away from Chittor,
but not my pride.

791
01:33:05,640 --> 01:33:08,810
You can steal a diamond,
but not it's sparkle.

792
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:11,060
Imprison him.

793
01:33:15,560 --> 01:33:22,310
You may imprison me, but can you
contain the storm rising from Chittor?

794
01:33:23,470 --> 01:33:26,010
-Long live the Khiljis!

795
01:33:26,640 --> 01:33:28,310
Long live!

796
01:33:37,720 --> 01:33:39,930
Greetings, My Lord!

797
01:33:59,720 --> 01:34:01,970
My Queen, please return to the Palace.

798
01:34:02,180 --> 01:34:04,000
A storm is gathering outside.

799
01:34:04,310 --> 01:34:08,310
And do not worry.
God's blessings are with the King.

800
01:34:08,390 --> 01:34:10,100
He will return safe and sound.

801
01:34:10,180 --> 01:34:11,640
No, Kunwar Baisa.

802
01:34:13,140 --> 01:34:14,810
I will wait here until the moon rises.

803
01:34:15,350 --> 01:34:18,630
But the moon won't rise, My Queen.
Tonight is a new moon!

804
01:34:53,810 --> 01:34:55,060
My Lord!

805
01:34:55,560 --> 01:34:58,850
Gora Singh, are you looking for your King?

806
01:34:59,180 --> 01:35:01,760
The storm blew him away to Delhi.

807
01:35:02,260 --> 01:35:04,100
He's been banished from his own kingdom!

808
01:35:06,460 --> 01:35:11,260
So you're the one who
brought Alauddin to Chittor!

809
01:35:14,010 --> 01:35:14,970
Traitor!

810
01:35:15,060 --> 01:35:18,060
If you even lay a finger on me,
your King will lose his life.

811
01:35:18,640 --> 01:35:20,760
There's a message for Queen Padmavati.

812
01:35:21,930 --> 01:35:27,100
If she wishes to see her King alive,
she must come there!

813
01:35:42,850 --> 01:35:55,180
O Motherland! Give us the strength;
to defend the pride of Rajputs.

814
01:35:56,350 --> 01:36:07,880
The hills of Mewar;
uphold our honour now.

815
01:36:22,880 --> 01:36:26,950
Hurry! The Queen has called us.

816
01:36:32,200 --> 01:36:35,280
Queen Nagmati has asked all the women...

817
01:36:35,560 --> 01:36:36,650
What's this?

818
01:36:37,320 --> 01:36:39,530
Why are you smearing mud on the mirrors?

819
01:36:40,110 --> 01:36:43,820
Until the King returns,
I won't see my face in the mirror.

820
01:36:43,900 --> 01:36:45,860
But, My Queen...
-What is it?

821
01:36:47,070 --> 01:36:49,400
Queen Nagmati has called
all the women.

822
01:36:50,070 --> 01:36:51,070
And you too.

823
01:37:12,780 --> 01:37:14,030
Why have you called us?

824
01:37:14,110 --> 01:37:15,030
Go away!

825
01:37:15,740 --> 01:37:17,420
Queen, did you call me?

826
01:37:17,500 --> 01:37:19,570
At least let me grieve in peace!

827
01:37:20,980 --> 01:37:25,320
If you hadn't banished the Royal Guru,
he wouldn't have joined hands with Alauddin.

828
01:37:25,400 --> 01:37:27,740
And Chittor would not be under threat!

829
01:37:28,710 --> 01:37:32,400
Today our King is in the enemy's clutches
and it's entirely your fault!

830
01:37:33,450 --> 01:37:34,600
Your beauty is to be blamed!

831
01:37:35,780 --> 01:37:37,900
What about the beholder?

832
01:37:39,400 --> 01:37:40,320
And his sinful gaze?

833
01:37:40,570 --> 01:37:44,150
They too are at fault.
And Mewar is paying the price for that.

834
01:37:44,590 --> 01:37:46,280
But you should face punishment too!

835
01:37:46,450 --> 01:37:50,650
How to punish someone
who is not at fault?

836
01:37:51,350 --> 01:37:54,780
Poison her? Throw her in the well?
Or imprison her?

837
01:37:54,860 --> 01:37:59,030
We should accept the Sultan's condition
and send Padmavati there.

838
01:38:01,650 --> 01:38:05,320
My Queen! How can you say that
being a woman yourself?

839
01:38:05,990 --> 01:38:07,360
Send her there?

840
01:38:07,990 --> 01:38:10,820
Hand her over to the Sultan?
Impossible!

841
01:38:12,110 --> 01:38:16,110
If we don't comply, neither our King
nor Mewar will survive!

842
01:38:16,200 --> 01:38:17,780
-My Queen!

843
01:38:19,740 --> 01:38:22,150
If the time comes
for such desperate measures...

844
01:38:22,910 --> 01:38:28,740
...then every woman in Chittor will
jump into the fire to protect her dignity.

845
01:38:29,490 --> 01:38:31,610
We'll perform Jauhar!
(Mass self-immolation).

846
01:38:32,900 --> 01:38:37,030
But we will never let our Queen
set foot out of this fort.

847
01:38:39,240 --> 01:38:42,040
How do I explain my grief to you all?

848
01:38:47,210 --> 01:38:48,290
I shall go.

849
01:38:50,940 --> 01:38:52,740
What are you saying, My Queen?

850
01:38:52,990 --> 01:38:56,240
Even the Goddess had to descend
from her abode to slay the demons.

851
01:38:58,550 --> 01:39:02,610
Who am I? A mere mortal.
I will only cross the threshold of Chittor.

852
01:39:04,540 --> 01:39:06,360
And you forget, My Queen.

853
01:39:07,570 --> 01:39:11,240
Rajput women are just as much
warriors as their men.

854
01:39:42,530 --> 01:39:43,900
-My Lord!

855
01:39:44,240 --> 01:39:48,240
I had told you!
I will bring Mewar down to its knees.

856
01:39:48,850 --> 01:39:52,360
I can feel your pain.
That's why I play the flute.

857
01:39:52,630 --> 01:39:54,280
Raag Yaman!
(Classical melody)

858
01:39:54,570 --> 01:39:57,700
Did it alleviate some of your sorrows?

859
01:39:57,780 --> 01:39:59,320
It can't.

860
01:40:00,270 --> 01:40:03,450
Your music once felt like sandalwood.

861
01:40:04,070 --> 01:40:04,740
And now?

862
01:40:04,820 --> 01:40:06,070
It stinks!

863
01:40:07,360 --> 01:40:08,860
Stinks of treason.

864
01:40:09,650 --> 01:40:12,740
You've lost your crown,
but not your pride.

865
01:40:12,820 --> 01:40:17,340
Not until I have the enemy's head at my feet.

866
01:40:17,420 --> 01:40:19,030
That's impossible!

867
01:40:19,650 --> 01:40:25,990
Raghav Chetan's fury has turned
your stars unfavourable for you.

868
01:40:27,500 --> 01:40:30,540
You will have to bow before the Sultan.

869
01:40:32,860 --> 01:40:35,740
Play on!Yaman.

870
01:40:54,440 --> 01:40:55,740
Greetings, My Queen.

871
01:40:57,070 --> 01:41:00,530
This sword had sworn to protect Mewari pride.

872
01:41:00,860 --> 01:41:03,150
But you've decided to go there.

873
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:04,780
You have embarrassed us.

874
01:41:05,570 --> 01:41:07,610
Take this sword and behead me.

875
01:41:08,070 --> 01:41:10,650
This is the only way to bring our King back.

876
01:41:10,860 --> 01:41:16,030
Don't you trust
our ability to bring our King back?

877
01:41:16,110 --> 01:41:17,570
I do!

878
01:41:17,890 --> 01:41:22,240
But not every war is won with might.
This time we'll have to use a different strategy.

879
01:41:22,320 --> 01:41:24,640
Our swords...
-Send a message to the Sultan.

880
01:41:24,720 --> 01:41:27,070
I don't agree with your decision.

881
01:41:27,490 --> 01:41:29,700
As your brother...

882
01:41:30,160 --> 01:41:34,950
This is not a request from a sister,
but an order of the Queen of Mewar!

883
01:41:40,070 --> 01:41:44,650
For the sake of King of Mewar's safety,
Queen Padmavati has agreed to come here.

884
01:41:45,070 --> 01:41:47,030
Congratulations Sultan!
Your wish has come true.

885
01:41:47,110 --> 01:41:49,070
Keep reading...
-Yes.

886
01:41:49,660 --> 01:41:51,450
But she has few conditions.

887
01:41:51,740 --> 01:41:54,400
The Queen will bring
eight hundred maids along.

888
01:41:54,490 --> 01:41:55,570
Agreed.

889
01:41:56,200 --> 01:42:00,360
They will stay at the women's chamber,
where no men can go.

890
01:42:00,570 --> 01:42:01,740
Agreed.

891
01:42:02,240 --> 01:42:07,900
Upon her arrival, she will meet the King first.
And meet the Sultan only after the King is released.

892
01:42:08,240 --> 01:42:09,900
Agreed.

893
01:42:09,990 --> 01:42:11,650
And her last condition...

894
01:42:13,860 --> 01:42:16,110
This is not possible, Sultan.

895
01:42:16,200 --> 01:42:18,400
What does she want?

896
01:42:18,490 --> 01:42:25,360
That palanquins won't leave Chittor until
Raghav Chetan's severed head is delivered to her.

897
01:42:27,110 --> 01:42:29,280
Agreed!

898
01:42:31,030 --> 01:42:32,650
This is unfair, Sultan.

899
01:42:33,320 --> 01:42:35,740
Don't forget that Queen Padmavati
will soon be yours only because of me...

900
01:42:35,820 --> 01:42:37,280
Agreed!

901
01:42:48,400 --> 01:42:50,240
Greetings, My Queen.

902
01:42:51,160 --> 01:42:52,240
What happened, Gora Singh?

903
01:42:52,320 --> 01:42:54,400
Khiljis have sent a reply to your message.

904
01:42:55,110 --> 01:42:57,780
Alauddin has accepted all your conditions.

905
01:42:58,740 --> 01:43:00,940
And has also sent a gift for you.

906
01:43:09,030 --> 01:43:12,550
Forgive me, My Queen.
We doubted your acumen.

907
01:43:13,200 --> 01:43:16,700
You eliminated our enemy
sitting here in Chittor.

908
01:43:16,900 --> 01:43:18,990
And now it's the Sultan's turn.

909
01:43:21,200 --> 01:43:23,110
But it's an impossible task without your support.

910
01:43:23,490 --> 01:43:31,450
We swear on the Almighty.
Every Rajput sword will now obey your command.

911
01:43:32,530 --> 01:43:35,740
Then take out the palanquins.
We will leave tomorrow.

912
01:43:35,950 --> 01:43:37,200
As you say, My Queen.

913
01:43:37,860 --> 01:43:41,360
I haven't seen the King's face in a long time.

914
01:44:33,740 --> 01:44:37,240
My heart is aloof from the world!

915
01:44:37,420 --> 01:44:40,780
My heart is aloof from the world!

916
01:44:40,860 --> 01:44:42,000
Well said!

917
01:44:42,080 --> 01:44:45,200
Ever since I'm consumed by love!

918
01:44:45,280 --> 01:44:46,570
Well said! Very nice!

919
01:44:46,650 --> 01:44:48,240
Now pay attention, Khusrau.

920
01:44:48,780 --> 01:44:51,950
All my heart strings are tugged.

921
01:44:52,300 --> 01:44:55,490
I've lost all slumber and peace.

922
01:44:56,150 --> 01:44:59,860
My eyes are clouded with dreams!

923
01:45:00,400 --> 01:45:03,320
Well said! Marvellous!

924
01:45:04,650 --> 01:45:06,030
Did you notice?

925
01:45:06,450 --> 01:45:11,120
Our most renowned poet,
Amir Khusrau praised my poetry.

926
01:45:11,200 --> 01:45:13,900
But it seems Itaat Khan didn't quite like it.

927
01:45:14,490 --> 01:45:17,990
Sultan, I don't understand such poetry.

928
01:45:18,110 --> 01:45:20,530
Because you don't understand love!

929
01:45:20,900 --> 01:45:22,850
You're not a poet, you're a coward!

930
01:45:26,950 --> 01:45:30,070
There's no reason to feel offended
by the Sultan's words.

931
01:45:30,150 --> 01:45:34,030
That was no joke, it was an insult Ashfaq.
I cannot tolerate this anymore.

932
01:45:34,110 --> 01:45:35,530
Now either the Sultan will live or me.

933
01:45:35,610 --> 01:45:36,860
What do you want to say?

934
01:45:37,070 --> 01:45:42,530
The court will celebrate tonight.
It's the right time to seize the throne!

935
01:46:17,450 --> 01:46:20,850
My heart is soaring in the skies!

936
01:46:24,490 --> 01:46:28,070
My heart is soaring in the skies!

937
01:46:31,570 --> 01:46:35,030
My beloved!

938
01:46:42,280 --> 01:46:45,860
Ever since I'm consumed by love!

939
01:46:45,950 --> 01:46:52,320
My heart is aloof from the world!

940
01:49:13,110 --> 01:49:16,610
May Allah accept our prayers.
-Amen.

941
01:49:16,960 --> 01:49:18,630
Physician!

942
01:49:18,840 --> 01:49:20,950
How is the Sultan doing?

943
01:49:21,780 --> 01:49:23,200
He is still unconscious.

944
01:49:23,360 --> 01:49:24,320
Hmm...

945
01:49:24,400 --> 01:49:28,900
The arrows were poisoned.
But by Allah's grace he's still breathing.

946
01:49:29,610 --> 01:49:34,740
Prayer chants...

947
01:49:47,780 --> 01:49:50,830
Uncle, I am here to inquire about your health.

948
01:50:06,440 --> 01:50:12,700
You killed my Uncle for the throne.
And I killed you, Uncle!

949
01:50:13,530 --> 01:50:16,280
Now Itaat Khan will be the new Sultan.

950
01:50:47,480 --> 01:50:54,820
To become the Sultan,
you need strong ambition and a stronger will!

951
01:51:04,700 --> 01:51:06,610
Praise be to Allah!

952
01:51:06,900 --> 01:51:08,950
The Sultan is conscious again!

953
01:51:09,030 --> 01:51:12,360
Praise be to Allah!

954
01:51:13,530 --> 01:51:15,610
Long live the Sultan!

955
01:51:15,700 --> 01:51:17,110
Long live!

956
01:51:26,800 --> 01:51:27,990
Greetings, My Queen.

957
01:51:28,320 --> 01:51:29,740
The palanquins are ready to leave.

958
01:51:29,990 --> 01:51:31,950
By tonight we must...
-Tomorrow morning.

959
01:51:33,320 --> 01:51:37,070
We will reach when the
Khilji army is busy praying.

960
01:51:39,570 --> 01:51:41,610
It will be easier to get to the King.

961
01:51:41,860 --> 01:51:44,740
What are you doing, My Queen?

962
01:51:44,820 --> 01:51:46,950
The map of Khilji's fort.

963
01:51:47,900 --> 01:51:51,990
When Rajputs don the saffron colour,
they bathe their enemy in blood.

964
01:51:59,490 --> 01:52:00,530
Sultan!

965
01:52:01,950 --> 01:52:03,280
Congratulations!

966
01:52:03,360 --> 01:52:05,490
You fool!
Mind the wounds.

967
01:52:05,900 --> 01:52:07,400
There's good news!

968
01:52:07,610 --> 01:52:10,360
The palanquins from Chittor
have reached our borders.

969
01:52:10,730 --> 01:52:14,570
Queen Padmavati will reach
by tomorrow morning.

970
01:52:14,900 --> 01:52:16,150
Glory be to God!

971
01:52:17,280 --> 01:52:18,650
Glory be to God!

972
01:52:20,070 --> 01:52:23,450
She's arriving at a time when I am not
in a condition to welcome her personally.

973
01:52:23,530 --> 01:52:29,530
Don't worry Sultan. I will personally
escort her to you, with great fanfare!

974
01:52:29,610 --> 01:52:34,950
I will welcome her in the Sultan's absence.
Not you!

975
01:52:35,280 --> 01:52:37,220
If the Sultan wishes so.

976
01:52:37,300 --> 01:52:39,900
Even I don't want any man
to go near Queen Padmavati.

977
01:52:39,990 --> 01:52:41,610
Her decision is apt.

978
01:52:41,790 --> 01:52:43,280
As you wish, Sire!

979
01:52:43,610 --> 01:52:48,320
The Empress of India will welcome
the Queen of Chittor.

980
01:52:49,320 --> 01:52:50,320
Wonderful!

981
01:52:55,780 --> 01:53:04,010
Islamic call to Prayer...

982
01:53:31,440 --> 01:53:36,980
Inform the Queen of Chittor that Mehrunisa,
Empress of India, is here to welcome her.

983
01:53:51,350 --> 01:53:53,060
You're truly a miracle of God!

984
01:53:53,140 --> 01:53:56,020
Such beauty can even make
angels have a change of heart.

985
01:53:56,520 --> 01:53:58,270
The Sultan is only human.

986
01:53:58,560 --> 01:53:59,940
And a culprit too.

987
01:54:01,940 --> 01:54:04,940
As per my conditions,
I will first meet the King.

988
01:54:05,310 --> 01:54:10,190
And until he is set free,
Gora and Sujaan Singh will be by my side.

989
01:54:11,520 --> 01:54:12,730
Please come this way.

990
01:54:18,810 --> 01:54:21,020
All maids, step out of the palanquins.

991
01:55:24,850 --> 01:55:25,600
Malik...

992
01:55:25,690 --> 01:55:26,810
Yes, Sire?

993
01:55:27,230 --> 01:55:30,690
Can you see any wound
other than my bleeding heart?

994
01:55:30,770 --> 01:55:31,770
No.

995
01:55:31,980 --> 01:55:36,620
Remember, no guard should be around,
when the Queen arrives.

996
01:55:36,700 --> 01:55:41,140
Be rest assured, Sire.
Your solitude will not be interrupted.

997
01:55:48,560 --> 01:55:58,230
Islamic Prayer...

998
01:55:59,730 --> 01:56:03,190
Greetings, Your Highness.

999
01:56:13,020 --> 01:56:15,740
My King!

1000
01:56:20,350 --> 01:56:23,100
Has Mewar bowed down to the enemy?

1001
01:56:24,750 --> 01:56:25,470
No.

1002
01:56:25,550 --> 01:56:27,730
Have you accepted the Sultan's conditions?

1003
01:56:29,240 --> 01:56:29,890
No.

1004
01:56:29,980 --> 01:56:32,730
Then why are you here?

1005
01:56:33,810 --> 01:56:35,190
I am here to set you free.

1006
01:56:35,440 --> 01:56:37,060
Mewar needs you.

1007
01:56:40,560 --> 01:56:42,810
Empress, now that I have arrived.
Please release him.

1008
01:56:42,890 --> 01:56:44,140
Most certainly.

1009
01:56:44,800 --> 01:56:49,820
Hajuriya, please inform the Sultan
that I will bring the Queen to him shortly.

1010
01:56:49,900 --> 01:56:51,190
Certainly.

1011
01:56:53,880 --> 01:56:56,640
Now listen to me carefully.
We don't have much time.

1012
01:56:57,060 --> 01:56:59,310
I will take you both to the secret tunnel.

1013
01:56:59,640 --> 01:57:01,940
It will get you across our borders.

1014
01:57:02,020 --> 01:57:04,060
Why are you helping us?

1015
01:57:05,140 --> 01:57:07,940
I am doing this for myself.

1016
01:57:08,390 --> 01:57:11,270
I am saving my Sultan from
committing a heinous crime.

1017
01:57:19,860 --> 01:57:23,440
-The prayers will soon be over.
We need to hurry!

1018
01:57:23,520 --> 01:57:28,350
You need to leave before the guards are back.

1019
01:57:29,100 --> 01:57:30,270
Wait, My Queen.

1020
01:57:31,270 --> 01:57:33,100
I won't leave without meeting Alauddin.

1021
01:57:33,900 --> 01:57:36,140
That could be dangerous for you.

1022
01:57:36,440 --> 01:57:37,770
Your life could be in danger too.

1023
01:57:37,850 --> 01:57:39,140
Allah is my protector.

1024
01:57:39,310 --> 01:57:42,140
For God's sake you must forsake this thought.

1025
01:57:42,390 --> 01:57:48,390
Empress Mehrunisa, I am a Rajput.
We never leave with our backs turned.

1026
01:58:25,850 --> 01:58:27,100
Oh!

1027
01:58:28,310 --> 01:58:32,890
King Ratan Singh!
How did you get to my court?

1028
01:58:32,970 --> 01:58:37,350
I had warned you.
You won't be able to stop the storm rising from Chittor.

1029
01:58:38,350 --> 01:58:45,020
I am so unfortunate. Each time I dream of
meeting Queen Padmavati, you interrupt me.

1030
01:58:45,100 --> 01:58:51,600
And you're so unfortunate that
I cannot show you my hospitality today.

1031
01:58:51,680 --> 01:58:54,940
You were never worthy of being a host.

1032
01:58:55,810 --> 01:58:57,940
Now you are not even worth
being my enemy.

1033
01:58:58,020 --> 01:59:00,140
But you're still worthy, aren't you?

1034
01:59:00,940 --> 01:59:02,310
Here...

1035
01:59:02,640 --> 01:59:05,560
Today is your opportunity.
Pick up this sword and sever my head.

1036
01:59:05,720 --> 01:59:11,280
Because if you leave me alive today,
you'll regret it forever.

1037
01:59:11,360 --> 01:59:14,270
You're lucky your enemy is a Rajput.

1038
01:59:18,270 --> 01:59:21,140
We don't attack the wounded and helpless.

1039
01:59:21,940 --> 01:59:27,140
You are so nice!
And so are your ethics!

1040
01:59:27,230 --> 01:59:29,770
You should learn some ethics too Alauddin.

1041
01:59:30,670 --> 01:59:32,020
They will make you into a human being.

1042
01:59:32,330 --> 01:59:36,850
My dear, there are no rules in love and war.

1043
01:59:36,990 --> 01:59:40,390
Without rules, your battle will be
remembered as a blemish in history.

1044
01:59:40,480 --> 01:59:42,230
I will set that page in history on fire.

1045
01:59:42,310 --> 01:59:47,190
History isn't just written on paper
which you can burn.

1046
01:59:48,060 --> 01:59:53,440
The day you're able to lift that sword
we shall meet in the battlefield.

1047
01:59:56,060 --> 02:00:04,640
I am leaving with my pride, my Queen,
from your fort and right in front of your eyes.

1048
02:00:06,060 --> 02:00:09,140
These wounds will take time to heal.

1049
02:00:10,060 --> 02:00:13,270
Until then my sword hangs over your head.

1050
02:00:23,690 --> 02:00:25,230
Ulugh Khan!

1051
02:00:25,890 --> 02:00:28,690
Ulugh Khan!

1052
02:00:29,310 --> 02:00:33,350
The Sultan has issued orders.
Troops will be here any moment.

1053
02:00:34,100 --> 02:00:36,190
Please leave immediately through the tunnel.

1054
02:00:40,310 --> 02:00:41,400
Gora Singh, let's go.

1055
02:00:41,480 --> 02:00:42,850
You proceed, My Lord.

1056
02:00:43,060 --> 02:00:45,770
I'll stop the enemy's army from following you.

1057
02:00:46,230 --> 02:00:47,310
We shall meet at Chittor.

1058
02:00:48,150 --> 02:00:49,230
Hail Almighty!

1059
02:00:51,230 --> 02:00:52,440
Hail Almighty!

1060
02:00:56,810 --> 02:00:58,190
Dilawar!

1061
02:00:58,940 --> 02:01:00,140
Dilawar!

1062
02:01:00,840 --> 02:01:03,190
Dilawar! Seal the gates!

1063
02:01:03,270 --> 02:01:04,670
What happened Commander?

1064
02:01:04,750 --> 02:01:07,230
We've been deceived.
The enemy is within the fort.

1065
02:01:07,310 --> 02:01:10,140
Charge!

1066
02:01:30,770 --> 02:01:31,940
Goodbye.

1067
02:01:42,770 --> 02:01:45,270
Charge!

1068
02:01:54,440 --> 02:01:55,970
War Cry!

1069
02:02:14,640 --> 02:02:16,100
Bad news, Sultan.

1070
02:02:16,440 --> 02:02:18,600
The Empress has foiled our plans.

1071
02:02:19,330 --> 02:02:21,850
Queen Padmavati and Ratan Singh
have escaped.

1072
02:02:21,940 --> 02:02:27,600
Is love written in my destiny?

1073
02:02:32,850 --> 02:02:36,060
Can you write it for me?

1074
02:02:37,500 --> 02:02:38,890
No.

1075
02:03:23,100 --> 02:03:27,690
The glorious warriors
who wielded their swords.

1076
02:03:28,850 --> 02:03:34,190
The brave-hearts who fought valiantly.

1077
02:03:37,190 --> 02:03:46,100
We salute the fearless Gora and Badal...

1078
02:03:46,740 --> 02:03:52,100
Who guarded the honour of Mewar.

1079
02:04:07,810 --> 02:04:09,020
Sultan.

1080
02:04:09,560 --> 02:04:11,310
Now what should we call her?

1081
02:04:11,810 --> 02:04:14,640
Empress or a traitor?

1082
02:04:39,640 --> 02:04:42,440
My own people have deceived me.

1083
02:04:44,690 --> 02:04:47,390
Itaat's arrows have injured me all over.

1084
02:04:47,480 --> 02:04:51,100
But your disloyalty broke my heart.

1085
02:04:52,810 --> 02:04:57,310
I loved you immensely but you betrayed me.

1086
02:04:57,840 --> 02:05:02,850
You took away my life's biggest dream.

1087
02:05:03,890 --> 02:05:06,330
Now I shall take away your identity...

1088
02:05:06,630 --> 02:05:11,310
...your imperial title,
the joy out of your life.

1089
02:05:13,810 --> 02:05:19,770
Before I leave for Chittor,
my last wish for you.

1090
02:05:20,520 --> 02:05:23,640
As I loved you immensely.

1091
02:05:26,270 --> 02:05:29,140
May you stay happy, prosperous...

1092
02:05:30,060 --> 02:05:31,600
...and blessed always.

1093
02:05:40,640 --> 02:05:41,600
Malik!

1094
02:05:41,980 --> 02:05:43,310
Yes, Sire.

1095
02:05:44,260 --> 02:05:48,520
Before my rage buries her alive...

1096
02:05:49,920 --> 02:05:52,100
...take her to the dungeons.

1097
02:05:52,310 --> 02:05:54,270
As you say.

1098
02:05:55,770 --> 02:05:58,850
Before I leave, I'll make a wish for you too.

1099
02:05:59,890 --> 02:06:02,100
May all your dreams realise.

1100
02:06:04,190 --> 02:06:07,730
But your dream of getting Padmavati
shall never come true.

1101
02:06:38,190 --> 02:06:41,230
-All hail Queen Padmavati!

1102
02:06:41,550 --> 02:06:44,770
All hail King Ratan Singh!

1103
02:07:01,440 --> 02:07:02,520
-My Queen...

1104
02:07:02,810 --> 02:07:06,310
The King and Queen Padmavati
have entered the fort.

1105
02:07:06,640 --> 02:07:08,890
Everyone's making preparations
to welcome them.

1106
02:07:08,980 --> 02:07:10,890
When everyone's busy welcoming them.

1107
02:07:11,600 --> 02:07:12,600
Then what should I do?

1108
02:07:12,690 --> 02:07:14,850
Welcome them.
What else?

1109
02:07:15,060 --> 02:07:18,190
Queen Padmavati achieved
what she set out for.

1110
02:07:18,270 --> 02:07:19,810
That is no ordinary feat.

1111
02:07:20,060 --> 02:07:23,190
So I'd suggest that you come along
and welcome them too!

1112
02:07:23,760 --> 02:07:25,390
You're not going anywhere, Kesar.

1113
02:07:26,890 --> 02:07:30,140
Go and get me a needle and thread.

1114
02:07:30,790 --> 02:07:34,000
I will. But first I must touch
Queen Padmavati's feet.

1115
02:07:38,060 --> 02:07:40,730
My Lord, we have all heard the legend of Savitri.

1116
02:07:41,060 --> 02:07:45,890
Who fought the Lord of Death
and brought her husband back to life.

1117
02:07:46,600 --> 02:07:50,230
Today I've started believing in that tale.

1118
02:08:03,140 --> 02:08:05,600
All hail Queen Padmavati!

1119
02:08:05,690 --> 02:08:07,190
Welcome back, My Queen!

1120
02:08:15,390 --> 02:08:18,060
Today you must not cheer for us...

1121
02:08:18,530 --> 02:08:22,520
But those martyrs,
who laid down their lives for Mewar.

1122
02:08:23,770 --> 02:08:27,230
Those who sacrificed their lives to save ours.

1123
02:08:28,480 --> 02:08:30,350
As long as Chittor exists...

1124
02:08:30,730 --> 02:08:33,310
...Gora and Badal's names will be remembered.

1125
02:08:33,390 --> 02:08:37,520
All hail the late Commander, Gora Singh!

1126
02:08:37,600 --> 02:08:41,350
All hail the brave Badal Singh!

1127
02:08:44,230 --> 02:08:46,100
Congratulations, My Queen.

1128
02:08:46,770 --> 02:08:48,440
You brought our King back.

1129
02:08:49,440 --> 02:08:52,440
You can look in the mirror again.

1130
02:08:53,100 --> 02:08:56,080
Now everyone will worship
you like a Goddess...

1131
02:08:56,160 --> 02:08:57,730
We couldn't save Badal!

1132
02:09:00,690 --> 02:09:04,390
The Rajputs who lay down their lives
in the battlefield never die.

1133
02:09:05,100 --> 02:09:06,390
They become immortal!

1134
02:09:07,190 --> 02:09:11,140
It was my son's duty to fight for Mewar.

1135
02:09:11,640 --> 02:09:13,520
He attained martyrdom.

1136
02:09:15,060 --> 02:09:18,600
Shedding tears for him...

1137
02:09:20,710 --> 02:09:23,640
I finally realised why Rajputs
are called brave-hearts...

1138
02:09:25,060 --> 02:09:27,420
...because they have such brave mothers.

1139
02:09:30,140 --> 02:09:33,730
This evening has come after a long time.

1140
02:09:35,670 --> 02:09:38,280
You must look your best
when you meet the King.

1141
02:09:56,390 --> 02:10:00,440
Khusrau, the river of love,
runs in strange directions.

1142
02:10:00,690 --> 02:10:04,980
Whoever takes a plunge, drowns,
And those who drown, find a shore.

1143
02:10:05,060 --> 02:10:06,270
Marvellous!

1144
02:10:07,940 --> 02:10:10,560
You're fortunate that you can narrate your pain...

1145
02:10:10,640 --> 02:10:13,890
...while I feel suffocated.

1146
02:10:15,170 --> 02:10:17,890
I cannot bear this failure anymore.

1147
02:10:17,980 --> 02:10:20,730
Sultan, what can I do to ease your pain?

1148
02:10:21,330 --> 02:10:24,100
As soon as we reach Chittor,
write a message.

1149
02:10:24,730 --> 02:10:29,190
Maybe you can narrate
my emotions with your poetic touch.

1150
02:10:29,600 --> 02:10:30,940
What do I write, Sultan?

1151
02:10:31,020 --> 02:10:32,690
That...

1152
02:10:33,140 --> 02:10:36,310
I will only wait for one more night.

1153
02:10:36,850 --> 02:10:39,100
Fulfill the Sultan's wish, or else...

1154
02:10:39,850 --> 02:10:41,720
...be ready to face his wrath.

1155
02:11:01,810 --> 02:11:03,350
-There you are!

1156
02:11:03,810 --> 02:11:08,020
What I feared has come true.
Alauddin has returned.

1157
02:11:08,580 --> 02:11:10,980
This time with an even bigger army!

1158
02:11:20,810 --> 02:11:23,060
You rubbed salt on his wounds.

1159
02:11:24,310 --> 02:11:25,850
This was bound to happen.

1160
02:12:59,890 --> 02:13:02,770
Be patient Sultan.
They will reply soon.

1161
02:13:03,690 --> 02:13:06,020
Give the Rajputs some time to think.

1162
02:13:06,100 --> 02:13:08,390
How much more time do they want?

1163
02:13:08,480 --> 02:13:13,600
They'll have no option but to present
Queen Padmavati to you by tomorrow morning.

1164
02:13:16,980 --> 02:13:20,100
I will wait from now on...

1165
02:13:22,100 --> 02:13:23,520
Under the scorching heat?

1166
02:13:23,600 --> 02:13:28,390
I don't want to miss the moment when
the doors of the fort open and she comes out.

1167
02:13:28,470 --> 02:13:31,940
I want to be the first one to see her.

1168
02:13:45,440 --> 02:13:54,230
Sanskrit Prayer chants...

1169
02:14:08,560 --> 02:14:12,250
Hail the Goddess!

1170
02:14:28,310 --> 02:14:29,560
What happened?

1171
02:14:30,500 --> 02:14:33,230
My sword looks stunning in your hands.

1172
02:14:33,940 --> 02:14:36,690
The sword is the most
precious jewel of warriors.

1173
02:14:39,470 --> 02:14:41,770
It's our pride.

1174
02:14:42,140 --> 02:14:44,690
If it's our pride,
then why are your eyes moist?

1175
02:14:45,640 --> 02:14:47,890
Do you fear that I might
not return from this war?

1176
02:14:48,190 --> 02:14:51,140
Padmavati has never feared anything in her life.

1177
02:14:53,980 --> 02:14:56,060
Can I ask you for something tonight?

1178
02:14:56,930 --> 02:15:00,850
There's nothing more you can ask for
except for my heart.

1179
02:15:01,360 --> 02:15:02,270
I can.

1180
02:15:09,520 --> 02:15:11,140
The right of Jauhar.

1181
02:15:14,690 --> 02:15:18,090
I cannot even die without your permission.

1182
02:15:54,400 --> 02:15:58,710
One heart.

1183
02:15:59,710 --> 02:16:04,340
One life.

1184
02:16:05,510 --> 02:16:19,070
I shall sacrifice for you.

1185
02:16:21,980 --> 02:16:26,360
There's me.

1186
02:16:26,610 --> 02:16:31,780
And my faith.

1187
02:16:31,860 --> 02:16:43,650
I shall sacrifice for you.

1188
02:16:44,070 --> 02:16:49,780
One heart.

1189
02:18:39,040 --> 02:18:40,110
Fire!

1190
02:19:15,010 --> 02:19:18,720
What is this?
I've never seen a weapon like this before!

1191
02:19:49,210 --> 02:19:51,480
It's time for me to leave.

1192
02:19:54,280 --> 02:19:55,570
Hmm.

1193
02:20:35,830 --> 02:20:38,610
It's the right time to move
our army forward, Sultan.

1194
02:20:38,690 --> 02:20:39,690
Not yet.

1195
02:20:40,980 --> 02:20:43,190
The walls of the fort are crumbling.

1196
02:20:44,050 --> 02:20:50,360
Soon they will have no choice
but to face us in the battlefield.

1197
02:21:59,480 --> 02:22:03,980
My Lord, the army is waiting
for your orders to attack.

1198
02:22:04,070 --> 02:22:05,440
No, Sujaan Singh.

1199
02:22:05,650 --> 02:22:06,980
I will go alone.

1200
02:22:07,610 --> 02:22:08,070
But My Lord...

1201
02:22:08,150 --> 02:22:11,690
This battle is between Alauddin and me.

1202
02:22:16,190 --> 02:22:19,400
Sire, why is he riding alone?

1203
02:22:19,480 --> 02:22:21,690
To fight the Sultan, what else?

1204
02:22:22,120 --> 02:22:23,070
Shall I go...?

1205
02:22:23,150 --> 02:22:24,110
No.

1206
02:22:25,190 --> 02:22:27,900
Only a diamond can cut diamond.

1207
02:24:41,500 --> 02:24:46,610
In every age, a war for righteousness
is fought between good and evil.

1208
02:24:47,090 --> 02:24:49,650
Like the one between Lord Ram and Raavan,

1209
02:24:50,020 --> 02:24:54,070
between the Pandavas and Kauravas
and now between the Rajputs and Khiljis.

1210
02:24:55,780 --> 02:24:58,230
And each time, the good triumphs.

1211
02:24:59,320 --> 02:25:04,440
Today, thousands of Rajputs have set out
to protect our dignity.

1212
02:25:05,190 --> 02:25:11,650
Chittor's walls have always shielded us.
But today our soldiers stand guard.

1213
02:25:15,960 --> 02:25:17,940
For us, they are no less than God.

1214
02:25:19,600 --> 02:25:24,860
-When a Rajput fights for his motherland,
the echo of his sword resonates through the ages.

1215
02:25:26,900 --> 02:25:29,030
-Whenever darkness engulfs the earth,

1216
02:25:29,710 --> 02:25:35,860
-Rajputs sacrifice their lives to spread light
and uphold truth and freedom.

1217
02:25:55,860 --> 02:25:58,780
No, Malik Kafur.
This is against the rules of warfare.

1218
02:25:58,860 --> 02:26:01,400
All is fair for the Sultan's victory.

1219
02:27:13,510 --> 02:27:16,980
You could've at least fought
this battle with integrity.

1220
02:27:18,370 --> 02:27:20,650
There's only one rule in the battlefield...

1221
02:27:22,500 --> 02:27:23,980
Victory!

1222
02:27:37,570 --> 02:27:38,940
Attack!

1223
02:27:41,730 --> 02:27:43,170
Charge!

1224
02:27:58,110 --> 02:28:04,320
-If our brave-hearts attain martyrdom today,
the enemy would still not be victorious.

1225
02:28:05,880 --> 02:28:09,820
Chittor will witness another war,
one that is unseen and unheard of.

1226
02:28:10,030 --> 02:28:11,930
And that war will be fought by us women!

1227
02:28:14,230 --> 02:28:18,900
Our enemies shall watch how we
turn our agony into victory.

1228
02:28:19,890 --> 02:28:25,690
It is time to reignite the holy fire that stood witness
to our oath, that only death will do us apart.

1229
02:28:27,900 --> 02:28:33,400
We shall offer ourselves to the holy fire
and perform Jauhar!

1230
02:28:38,390 --> 02:28:43,320
Those who lust for our body,
would not even get their hands on our shadows!

1231
02:28:44,460 --> 02:28:49,360
Our bodies will be reduced to ashes,
but our pride and honour will remain immortal.

1232
02:28:50,150 --> 02:28:54,820
And that will be the biggest defeat
of Alauddin's life!

1233
02:28:56,070 --> 02:28:57,320
My Queen...

1234
02:28:57,740 --> 02:28:59,690
Our King is no more!

1235
02:29:10,530 --> 02:29:12,900
The time has come
to don the veil of fire.

1236
02:29:16,280 --> 02:29:18,440
Shut the gates of the fort.

1237
02:29:20,070 --> 02:29:23,030
Shut the gates!

1238
02:30:41,900 --> 02:30:44,530
Charge!

1239
02:31:13,360 --> 02:31:16,070
Charge!

1240
02:34:34,920 --> 02:34:40,490
Hail the Goddess!

1241
02:38:21,240 --> 02:38:25,900
Queen Padmavati's Jauhar was
the biggest defeat of Alauddin's life.

1242
02:38:26,150 --> 02:38:28,440
And Chittor's greatest victory.

1243
02:38:29,330 --> 02:38:36,490
Centuries later, the tale of her
valour and sacrifice echoes in the heart of India.

1244
02:38:37,190 --> 02:38:44,070
To this day, she is worshipped as the Goddess Queen,
the destroyer of evil.
