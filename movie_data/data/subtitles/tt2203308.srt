1
00:01:12,272 --> 00:01:14,104
And now, friends.

2
00:01:14,141 --> 00:01:16,200
It's an honor to
introduce to all of you..

3
00:01:16,276 --> 00:01:18,108
...the nation's heart-throb.

4
00:01:18,212 --> 00:01:20,010
The one and only.

5
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:26,019
Singer, music-composer,
and song-writer.. Rahul Jayekar.

6
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:29,089
We're bringing you live
updates about this concert.

7
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:32,092
As you can see, the ambiance
is ready, the stage is set.

8
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:34,058
And the fans have
been waiting for..

9
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:35,289
...Rahul Jayekar for
the past two hours.

10
00:01:41,068 --> 00:01:43,036
Mr. Deepak. He won't make it.

11
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:45,070
I am Aryan. I'm a singer too.

12
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,164
Ohh! Get lost!
- Let me go on the stage.

13
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:49,072
Sir. Listen to me.

14
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,076
Sir, I've been struggling
for five years..

15
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:51,110
...all thanks to people like these.

16
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,169
<i>Sir, I am ready.
Take me in, please.</i>

17
00:01:54,014 --> 00:01:55,243
Struggle for 10 more years.

18
00:01:56,016 --> 00:01:57,074
Turn authentic.

19
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,051
And if I'm still alive,
you can come meet me.

20
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,211
Okay. Get lost now.

21
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:02,985
Hello. Where's Vivek..

22
00:02:03,023 --> 00:02:05,048
Vivek! Vivek!

23
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,059
Tell me honestly..

24
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,095
<i>...am I going to have a show or not?</i>

25
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:12,226
Please. Get this show
done for the last time.

26
00:02:13,033 --> 00:02:15,297
That announcer's
tired of announcing..

27
00:02:16,003 --> 00:02:17,061
...sir's arrival on stage.

28
00:02:17,171 --> 00:02:18,297
"He's coming now!"

29
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:20,234
"He's on his way!"

30
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:23,100
Please. Don't ruin my show.

31
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,115
Rahul.

32
00:02:31,218 --> 00:02:32,276
Time to go on stage.

33
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:37,121
What's the problem, Vivek?

34
00:02:37,224 --> 00:02:38,988
They paid me for this.

35
00:02:39,193 --> 00:02:40,251
I'm here to sing.

36
00:02:41,061 --> 00:02:43,029
And I won't leave without singing.

37
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:49,235
In fact, those who expect nothing..

38
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,195
...are the more responsible ones.

39
00:02:55,142 --> 00:02:56,109
Let's go.

40
00:02:58,078 --> 00:03:01,013
After countless album songs,
and live concerts..

41
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:07,017
If anyone tries to create a scene,
just ignore him.

42
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:09,018
If anything goes wrong..

43
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:10,248
...the security here will handle it.

44
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,257
Listen.

45
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:14,158
Just control yourself.

46
00:03:16,263 --> 00:03:20,029
<i>RJLRJL R!</i>

47
00:03:20,067 --> 00:03:21,125
Ask the boys to be ready.

48
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:25,035
We're going to give them a show.
- Your wait's over.

49
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:28,175
And we're going to call on stage..

50
00:03:28,242 --> 00:03:31,075
...your favorite, RJ.

51
00:03:31,245 --> 00:03:35,204
That is, Rahul Jayekar.

52
00:04:05,045 --> 00:04:13,045
"Bless me with your grace."

53
00:04:51,058 --> 00:04:53,220
"Give me thoughts."

54
00:04:54,061 --> 00:04:56,189
"Give me oaths and promises."

55
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:02,161
"Give directions to my prayers."

56
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:05,102
"Give my heart refuge.”

57
00:05:05,239 --> 00:05:08,106
"Give me new reasons."

58
00:05:08,242 --> 00:05:14,147
"Give my dreams wings to fly."

59
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:20,144
"Bless me with your grace."

60
00:05:21,088 --> 00:05:25,218
"Take a look at me as well."

61
00:05:25,292 --> 00:05:30,230
"Are you listening?"

62
00:05:31,231 --> 00:05:37,000
"I am crying."

63
00:05:37,204 --> 00:05:42,074
"Are you listening?"

64
00:05:42,142 --> 00:05:47,103
<i>"Why I am crying."</i>

65
00:05:52,152 --> 00:05:55,122
He's drunk! RJ!

66
00:06:28,021 --> 00:06:32,982
"Destiny's are lost."

67
00:06:34,027 --> 00:06:39,022
"“The path's forlorn."

68
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:45,033
"'Come and take me away."

69
00:06:45,205 --> 00:06:50,166
<i>“That's all I pray for."</i>

70
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:56,278
"It's your safekeeping.”

71
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:04,081
"You belong to me."

72
00:07:06,193 --> 00:07:11,996
"Bless me with your grace."

73
00:07:12,132 --> 00:07:17,002
"Take a look at me as well."

74
00:07:17,037 --> 00:07:21,235
"Are you listening?"

75
00:07:22,276 --> 00:07:28,045
"I am crying."

76
00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:34,210
"Are you listening?"

77
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,250
RJ!

78
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:48,996
Come, come.

79
00:07:59,012 --> 00:08:00,138
What are you waiting for?
Get the camera.

80
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,270
Hurry up.

81
00:08:02,015 --> 00:08:03,039
Take the shot!

82
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:09,021
Get up. - Rahul, leave.

83
00:08:10,123 --> 00:08:12,990
<i>You have ruined me.
1 won't spare you, RJ.</i>

84
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:13,993
Rahul, let be.

85
00:08:14,061 --> 00:08:15,995
Get out.

86
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:20,227
I don't want security.
I don't want it.

87
00:08:21,068 --> 00:08:22,194
Wait.

88
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:27,070
Let's go - Yes sir.

89
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:31,011
I know, these things
happen in cheap shows.

90
00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:32,044
Anyway.

91
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:33,204
We'll discuss this
back at the hotel.

92
00:08:36,283 --> 00:08:39,014
I want to stay alone!

93
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:40,983
Go somewhere far away.

94
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:42,988
<i>But, do you have a
problem if I come with you?</i>

95
00:08:43,056 --> 00:08:44,114
No, there's no problem.

96
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:47,092
I just want to go away
from this commotion. - What?

97
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:50,029
There's not much
of commotion left now.

98
00:08:52,132 --> 00:08:53,156
It's almost over, Rahul.

99
00:08:54,301 --> 00:08:58,135
After doing shows at London,
New York, Australia..

100
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:00,164
...now you don't have work.

101
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:04,009
No one wants to work with you.

102
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,215
Music directors. Film industry,
stage shows, pop albums.

103
00:09:09,249 --> 00:09:10,239
You've nothing.

104
00:09:12,152 --> 00:09:16,089
No one's going to support
a drunk artist for too long.

105
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:19,157
No one's going to tolerate that.

106
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,222
And now, it's come to this..

107
00:09:22,262 --> 00:09:24,230
...that we've to perform
in small cities.

108
00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:28,999
And pardon me,
this is what happens in such shows.

109
00:09:30,037 --> 00:09:32,028
There's a lot that
happens in my heart too.

110
00:09:32,272 --> 00:09:34,104
So what? - Nothing.

111
00:09:34,308 --> 00:09:36,072
Just stop drinking.

112
00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:39,977
We haven't lost anything yet.

113
00:09:41,215 --> 00:09:42,239
You were a star yesterday.

114
00:09:43,016 --> 00:09:45,075
And you still are.
- Are you finished?

115
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:46,219
Can I go?

116
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:49,279
Yeah, go on.

117
00:09:50,157 --> 00:09:51,181
But, this isn't Mumbai.

118
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:53,020
Sir your car.

119
00:09:55,162 --> 00:09:56,152
Where will you go?

120
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:57,288
In this strange city?

121
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:02,127
If you meet with an accident
in this state, you'll end up dead.

122
00:10:03,036 --> 00:10:05,095
You know me well, Vivek.

123
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,201
I don't drink to die.

124
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:10,167
<i>But, I would die for a drink.</i>

125
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:15,106
So see you, Vivek. - Rahul.

126
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:31,187
"The time's standing still."

127
00:10:32,266 --> 00:10:37,170
"How did this happen.”

128
00:10:38,205 --> 00:10:43,234
I want you to come in my life."

129
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:49,241
"Like a wish comes true."

130
00:10:50,017 --> 00:10:55,148
"You're the satisfaction
of my soul.”

131
00:10:55,289 --> 00:10:59,283
"You're my faith."

132
00:11:00,027 --> 00:11:04,055
And this award
goes to Rahul Jaykar!

133
00:11:05,132 --> 00:11:10,161
"Bless me with your grace."

134
00:11:11,104 --> 00:11:15,268
"Take a look at me as well."

135
00:11:16,076 --> 00:11:19,046
Rahul Jaykar has been honored
with the best male singer award.

136
00:11:19,112 --> 00:11:22,013
RJ the most popular Indian singer.

137
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:28,011
RJ's new song is super hit.

138
00:11:30,257 --> 00:11:38,257
RJ! RJ! RJ!

139
00:11:39,133 --> 00:11:44,162
"Are you listening?"

140
00:11:45,072 --> 00:11:49,202
"I am crying."

141
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:55,009
"Are you listening?"

142
00:11:55,282 --> 00:11:59,185
"I am crying."

143
00:11:59,253 --> 00:12:04,282
"You are listening, aren't you?"

144
00:12:05,192 --> 00:12:10,289
"I am crying."

145
00:12:11,165 --> 00:12:16,069
"You are listening, aren't you?"

146
00:12:16,103 --> 00:12:23,976
"I am crying."

147
00:12:42,162 --> 00:12:43,994
Oh no!

148
00:12:45,165 --> 00:12:46,189
Sorry!
Are you okay?

149
00:12:47,067 --> 00:12:48,057
What okay?

150
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:49,159
It's a sunny day, right?

151
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:51,260
So, you're driving
with your goggles.

152
00:12:52,106 --> 00:12:54,074
You made me drop
all the vegetables.

153
00:12:54,141 --> 00:12:57,042
I just lost 86 rupees. - 86 rupees.

154
00:13:02,082 --> 00:13:06,110
It's a lot of money.
- What are you looking at?

155
00:13:07,154 --> 00:13:09,145
Pick up the remaining tomatoes.
Come on.

156
00:13:09,223 --> 00:13:10,190
Yes.

157
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,251
Three were crushed under the car.

158
00:13:19,032 --> 00:13:23,094
I'll send you the money.
Give me your address.

159
00:13:24,037 --> 00:13:27,996
No. You should be taught a lesson.

160
00:13:28,242 --> 00:13:29,209
Bend down.

161
00:13:29,276 --> 00:13:32,143
Bend down!
And pick them all up.

162
00:13:33,213 --> 00:13:34,180
Sorry.

163
00:13:49,229 --> 00:13:51,163
They are spoilt now.

164
00:14:01,175 --> 00:14:02,142
Forget it.

165
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,270
I am sorry Ms..

166
00:14:08,015 --> 00:14:09,244
That was two days ration.

167
00:14:10,217 --> 00:14:11,241
You ruined it.

168
00:14:31,171 --> 00:14:33,139
Make me a large.
- The bar's closed.

169
00:14:34,308 --> 00:14:36,174
Make me a drink. - The bar's..

170
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:40,271
Mr. RJ sir, you!

171
00:14:41,281 --> 00:14:44,012
Sir, I'm a big fan.

172
00:14:44,051 --> 00:14:45,246
Make me a drink.

173
00:14:46,053 --> 00:14:48,044
Sir. - I'm okay.

174
00:14:48,322 --> 00:14:49,289
Make me a drink.

175
00:14:50,057 --> 00:14:53,027
I am sorry, sir.
But the bar's closed.

176
00:14:53,093 --> 00:14:55,027
The owner's father
passed away, so..

177
00:14:56,196 --> 00:14:57,254
Father's dead.

178
00:14:59,133 --> 00:15:00,225
<i>So, where can I get a drink?</i>

179
00:15:01,034 --> 00:15:03,002
<i>Sir, I can give you
drink mixed with coke.</i>

180
00:15:03,137 --> 00:15:05,162
No one will know.

181
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,098
Forget it.

182
00:15:09,243 --> 00:15:11,302
Someone's father is dead.
Why cheat.

183
00:15:14,181 --> 00:15:16,013
Then, can you tell
me if there's a bar around.

184
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:17,050
I'll be grateful.

185
00:15:18,018 --> 00:15:18,985
Bar?

186
00:15:19,052 --> 00:15:22,078
Oh yes, there's a beer
bar just a few paces ahead.

187
00:15:23,023 --> 00:15:24,081
It stays open until 2 o'clock.

188
00:15:24,158 --> 00:15:27,059
But, that place
isn't your standards.

189
00:15:28,262 --> 00:15:30,128
I'm not up to my standards, either.

190
00:15:30,264 --> 00:15:31,231
What?

191
00:15:34,168 --> 00:15:35,192
Nothing.

192
00:15:36,236 --> 00:15:37,203
Thank you.

193
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:45,178
"Destiny's are lost."

194
00:15:45,212 --> 00:15:50,241
"“The path's forlorn."

195
00:15:51,185 --> 00:15:56,282
"'Come and take me away."

196
00:15:57,124 --> 00:16:01,994
<i>“That's all I pray for."</i>

197
00:16:02,229 --> 00:16:08,066
"It's your safekeeping.”

198
00:16:08,202 --> 00:16:14,141
"You belong to me."

199
00:16:20,113 --> 00:16:23,014
"Give me thoughts."

200
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:25,211
"Give me oaths and promises."

201
00:16:26,053 --> 00:16:31,253
"Give directions to my prayers."

202
00:16:32,025 --> 00:16:34,187
"Give my heart refuge.”

203
00:16:34,294 --> 00:16:37,093
"Give me new reasons."

204
00:16:38,031 --> 00:16:43,197
"Give my dreams wings to fly."

205
00:16:44,171 --> 00:16:50,008
"Bless me with your grace."

206
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:54,206
"Take a look at me as well."

207
00:16:55,015 --> 00:16:59,145
"Are you listening?"

208
00:17:00,287 --> 00:17:05,191
"I am crying."

209
00:17:06,226 --> 00:17:11,027
"Are you listening?"

210
00:17:11,165 --> 00:17:16,103
<i>"Why I am crying."</i>

211
00:17:29,116 --> 00:17:30,174
Keep this inside.

212
00:17:30,284 --> 00:17:32,218
What are you doing?
- He's here.

213
00:17:33,187 --> 00:17:35,019
Who? - Don't know.

214
00:17:35,255 --> 00:17:37,053
He was drunk and driving.

215
00:17:37,191 --> 00:17:39,125
I barely managed to escape.

216
00:17:40,227 --> 00:17:43,026
He's no-good.
Just enjoying for free.

217
00:17:43,097 --> 00:17:44,189
Don't look at him.

218
00:17:45,165 --> 00:17:47,031
Forget it. The manager's watching.

219
00:17:49,102 --> 00:17:50,194
Go on.

220
00:18:01,215 --> 00:18:07,052
"The time's standing still."

221
00:18:07,187 --> 00:18:12,091
"How did this happen.”

222
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:18,257
"I want you came in my life."

223
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:24,003
"Like a wish comes true."

224
00:18:24,271 --> 00:18:30,074
"You're the satisfaction
of my soul.”

225
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:36,115
"You're my faith."

226
00:18:40,053 --> 00:18:45,184
"Bless me with your grace."

227
00:18:46,026 --> 00:18:50,156
"Take a look at me as well."

228
00:18:50,197 --> 00:18:55,033
"Are you listening?"

229
00:18:56,136 --> 00:19:00,232
"I am crying."

230
00:19:02,109 --> 00:19:06,205
"Are you listening?"

231
00:19:07,081 --> 00:19:12,144
<i>"Why I am crying."</i>

232
00:19:29,303 --> 00:19:31,135
Salim, he's right here.

233
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:32,161
I'm going to yell at him.

234
00:19:32,206 --> 00:19:34,140
He's coming, isn't here?
He's here, right?

235
00:19:35,109 --> 00:19:36,167
Look, I..

236
00:19:37,111 --> 00:19:38,272
Hello. - Hello, sir..

237
00:19:39,012 --> 00:19:41,140
RJ. - Yes.

238
00:19:41,248 --> 00:19:44,218
Rahul... Jayekar! - Yes.

239
00:19:45,085 --> 00:19:48,146
This song.. - You, at our hotel?

240
00:19:49,223 --> 00:19:54,127
<i>And, I was singing your song. - No.</i>

241
00:19:54,228 --> 00:19:57,163
<i>Salil. I said such rubbish.</i>

242
00:19:57,197 --> 00:20:00,064
I want to talk to you.
- Sir, sorry..

243
00:20:00,167 --> 00:20:02,158
<i>Sit. - And,
I made you do such stupid things.</i>

244
00:20:02,269 --> 00:20:05,102
Pick up vegetables..
- Be quiet for a minute.

245
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:11,041
What's your name?

246
00:20:12,112 --> 00:20:14,012
Aarohi Keshav Shirke.

247
00:20:15,015 --> 00:20:15,982
Aarohi.

248
00:20:18,152 --> 00:20:21,213
<i>You've a great voice.
- No, I was just..</i>

249
00:20:21,288 --> 00:20:23,222
Just listen.

250
00:20:25,225 --> 00:20:26,192
Yes.

251
00:20:27,127 --> 00:20:29,152
You sung my song better than me.

252
00:20:32,132 --> 00:20:34,157
I just realized my flaws.

253
00:20:35,302 --> 00:20:38,067
<i>The mistakes I made in my songs.</i>

254
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:42,265
I never felt any
of my song like this.

255
00:20:43,177 --> 00:20:45,043
You're joking.

256
00:20:46,113 --> 00:20:47,080
No.

257
00:20:48,115 --> 00:20:50,982
I never joke when concerns singing.

258
00:20:54,021 --> 00:20:55,989
Rahul! Rahul!

259
00:20:56,256 --> 00:20:57,246
Are you mad?

260
00:20:58,025 --> 00:20:59,993
I found your car crashed,
in the middle of the road.

261
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,994
Whether you're dead or alive,
you could've have..

262
00:21:03,063 --> 00:21:04,189
What are you doing here?

263
00:21:05,099 --> 00:21:05,998
Let's go.

264
00:21:06,033 --> 00:21:07,023
Let's go from here.

265
00:21:07,234 --> 00:21:09,999
Rahul, let's go.
- Don't go, Aarohi.

266
00:21:11,105 --> 00:21:12,004
Let's go.

267
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:13,029
Let's leave.

268
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,106
He's a drunkard.

269
00:21:15,242 --> 00:21:18,234
He was just trying
to convince her..

270
00:21:19,012 --> 00:21:19,240
Yes, let's go.

271
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:22,180
Is 1 am. And,
the police can raid any moment.

272
00:21:22,216 --> 00:21:24,150
But, he's such a big artist.

273
00:21:25,018 --> 00:21:26,042
If we leave..

274
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,211
He won't know. Let's go.

275
00:21:28,255 --> 00:21:30,986
Deepak's looking all over for you.

276
00:21:31,158 --> 00:21:33,149
We've four more shows to do.
If this continues..

277
00:21:34,061 --> 00:21:35,222
...we'll have to
return all the money.

278
00:21:35,295 --> 00:21:37,195
We will return the money, Vivek.

279
00:21:37,297 --> 00:21:39,163
What are you saying Rahul?

280
00:21:39,233 --> 00:21:42,168
Listen. I've to go
back to Mumbai tomorrow.

281
00:21:43,137 --> 00:21:47,005
This singer, Aarohi.. - Who?

282
00:21:47,107 --> 00:21:48,040
Where's everyone?

283
00:21:48,075 --> 00:21:49,008
Forget it, let's go.

284
00:21:49,042 --> 00:21:51,170
Rahul, let's go. - Wait.

285
00:21:52,045 --> 00:21:55,106
Where's everyone? - They all left.

286
00:21:58,118 --> 00:22:00,018
<i>I want that girl's address.</i>

287
00:22:00,053 --> 00:22:01,282
Where does she stay? - Kolhapanaji!

288
00:22:02,089 --> 00:22:04,080
I'm going. - What?

289
00:22:04,191 --> 00:22:05,249
Give me the car keys.

290
00:22:06,026 --> 00:22:07,084
What are you doing? - Give it.

291
00:22:07,261 --> 00:22:09,025
What's going on?

292
00:22:09,263 --> 00:22:12,028
What are you doing?
- Pay for the whiskey.

293
00:22:12,099 --> 00:22:13,066
Rahul!

294
00:22:14,067 --> 00:22:15,228
<i>Rahul! How will I go home?</i>

295
00:22:31,318 --> 00:22:34,185
"You've a great voice.'

296
00:22:36,256 --> 00:22:38,987
'You sung my song better than me."

297
00:22:46,066 --> 00:22:48,000
'l just realized my flaws."

298
00:22:49,069 --> 00:22:51,163
'The mistakes I made in my songs.'

299
00:22:52,172 --> 00:22:55,233
<i>I never felt any
of my song like this.'</i>

300
00:23:08,055 --> 00:23:16,055
Aarohi!

301
00:23:24,071 --> 00:23:26,062
Hi. - Oh, God!

302
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:29,007
<i>I want to talk to you, come down.</i>

303
00:23:30,144 --> 00:23:31,111
Come down.

304
00:23:32,179 --> 00:23:34,170
I can't come. - Fine, I'm coming.

305
00:23:36,116 --> 00:23:41,020
No. no. no. - What?

306
00:23:45,125 --> 00:23:47,059
I'm coming. - Come down.

307
00:24:22,029 --> 00:24:23,053
What are you doing?

308
00:24:24,098 --> 00:24:25,998
What happened?

309
00:24:26,166 --> 00:24:27,133
Come on.

310
00:24:28,068 --> 00:24:30,264
What happened?

311
00:24:31,271 --> 00:24:32,238
Come here.

312
00:24:33,107 --> 00:24:34,199
What are you doing?

313
00:24:36,276 --> 00:24:39,041
I'm not allowed
to meet anyone here.

314
00:24:39,146 --> 00:24:42,116
If the bar's management sees me..

315
00:24:42,116 --> 00:24:44,210
...he'll deduct a day's salary.
- Sorry.

316
00:24:45,252 --> 00:24:47,152
I had to come.

317
00:24:49,022 --> 00:24:52,981
We couldn't complete
our conversation at the bar..

318
00:24:53,127 --> 00:24:54,094
What?

319
00:24:54,261 --> 00:24:55,228
So...

320
00:24:59,266 --> 00:25:03,169
You want to be a singer?
- Who said that?

321
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:04,237
You did.

322
00:25:06,206 --> 00:25:09,141
You were looking at Lata's picture.

323
00:25:11,011 --> 00:25:13,070
Just like a child
looks at the moon.

324
00:25:15,015 --> 00:25:16,107
Wants to touch it.

325
00:25:18,152 --> 00:25:21,247
That look told me everything.

326
00:25:24,091 --> 00:25:26,025
Everyone looks at the moon.

327
00:25:28,295 --> 00:25:31,060
What good is that? - The beginning.

328
00:25:32,199 --> 00:25:34,065
Of every successful journey.

329
00:25:35,302 --> 00:25:40,103
You know,
the best artists in the world..

330
00:25:41,241 --> 00:25:44,006
...are the ones who
have their own style.

331
00:25:45,012 --> 00:25:47,071
A style,
that doesn't come from imitation.

332
00:25:48,315 --> 00:25:51,012
A style, that's born with them.

333
00:25:53,153 --> 00:25:54,985
And, you've got that.

334
00:25:56,023 --> 00:25:57,115
That special thing.

335
00:25:58,092 --> 00:26:01,187
I wonder what's that thing..

336
00:26:02,196 --> 00:26:04,255
...that you heard,
but the others can't.

337
00:26:05,232 --> 00:26:09,260
I tried really hard.

338
00:26:12,206 --> 00:26:14,174
But, no one gave me a chance.

339
00:26:15,042 --> 00:26:16,134
<i>That's why I am here.</i>

340
00:26:18,212 --> 00:26:20,112
<i>Because,
1 want to make you successful.</i>

341
00:26:21,014 --> 00:26:23,142
<i>I want to make you the greatest
singer of this millennium.</i>

342
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:33,026
Look I... not the
kind of girl you think.

343
00:26:35,129 --> 00:26:37,996
I don't say these
things to those girls.

344
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:45,034
But, what to do?

345
00:26:46,173 --> 00:26:47,231
Il think ll am in love.

346
00:26:49,109 --> 00:26:50,201
I've gone crazy.

347
00:26:51,211 --> 00:26:55,239
Now, whether it's the art
or the artist, that's yet to say.

348
00:26:57,251 --> 00:26:58,241
We'll know.

349
00:27:01,121 --> 00:27:03,215
But, only after you're sober.

350
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:14,097
Listen. - What?

351
00:27:15,002 --> 00:27:16,128
You won't work in that bar.

352
00:27:17,237 --> 00:27:19,035
You'll leave that job.

353
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,232
<i>Because I say so.</i>

354
00:27:26,146 --> 00:27:27,238
Do you believe me?

355
00:27:35,155 --> 00:27:36,122
Listen.

356
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,227
What?

357
00:27:43,063 --> 00:27:44,030
Nothing.

358
00:27:47,234 --> 00:27:48,292
Just like that.

359
00:28:07,221 --> 00:28:09,053
Aarohi, are you okay?

360
00:28:10,257 --> 00:28:12,282
<i>Yes. I am fine.</i>

361
00:28:21,001 --> 00:28:22,059
25,000!

362
00:28:22,302 --> 00:28:25,237
<i>That's what I spent
to bring you here.</i>

363
00:28:26,173 --> 00:28:30,041
I suggest,
you pay up and you can leave.

364
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,047
What?

365
00:28:34,214 --> 00:28:35,238
Don't have it.

366
00:28:36,183 --> 00:28:37,173
Go.

367
00:28:41,255 --> 00:28:42,245
Shankar sir.

368
00:28:44,291 --> 00:28:46,157
It's the question of my life.

369
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,152
Please let me go.

370
00:28:49,163 --> 00:28:51,996
I'll return your money
once I get to Mumbai.

371
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:56,092
No one's going to pay
even 200 for this face.

372
00:28:56,303 --> 00:28:57,998
What do you think?

373
00:28:58,072 --> 00:29:00,097
This is no orphanage.

374
00:29:01,075 --> 00:29:03,009
Pay up and leave.

375
00:29:03,177 --> 00:29:05,111
You take up 50 percent.

376
00:29:06,146 --> 00:29:07,204
And, what are we left with?

377
00:29:07,281 --> 00:29:09,272
We've to buy food
with our own money.

378
00:29:10,184 --> 00:29:13,051
It'll take me months
to arrange that kind of money.

379
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,178
Yeah! Exactly.

380
00:29:14,221 --> 00:29:18,089
That's why you steal
money from the money-bag.

381
00:29:18,292 --> 00:29:20,124
What else do you expect me to do?

382
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:23,093
You cut 100 rupees
for minor mistakes.

383
00:29:23,163 --> 00:29:24,995
200 for coming late.

384
00:29:25,099 --> 00:29:26,260
And my salary.. - Babu!

385
00:29:27,034 --> 00:29:28,195
What's wrong with her?

386
00:29:28,302 --> 00:29:30,270
She's constantly
saying "'l want to go".

387
00:29:31,038 --> 00:29:32,096
She was fine until yesterday.

388
00:29:32,239 --> 00:29:34,173
That singer RJ that
came to bar yesterday..

389
00:29:34,241 --> 00:29:36,073
...is the one that provoked her.

390
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:37,134
That he'll make her a singer.

391
00:29:37,211 --> 00:29:39,043
Give her a chance to sing in films.

392
00:29:39,179 --> 00:29:41,045
Since then.. - I see.

393
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:44,047
RJ. That singer.

394
00:29:45,219 --> 00:29:46,243
Just a minute.

395
00:29:48,088 --> 00:29:49,055
Look.

396
00:29:49,156 --> 00:29:51,181
His picture's in the papers.

397
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:54,218
He had a fight
with a man yesterday.

398
00:29:55,162 --> 00:29:58,154
He left before the show started.

399
00:29:59,066 --> 00:30:01,296
The organizer of the
show was crying on camera.

400
00:30:02,136 --> 00:30:04,036
There are many other
stories about him.

401
00:30:04,138 --> 00:30:05,230
But, no news about his work.

402
00:30:07,274 --> 00:30:09,242
He'll get you work.

403
00:30:11,111 --> 00:30:15,275
A man that's living off
his hit songs of yesteryear..

404
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:18,280
...can only pass time with you.

405
00:30:19,152 --> 00:30:20,176
Do you know why?

406
00:30:20,287 --> 00:30:22,278
Because you're worth it.

407
00:30:34,201 --> 00:30:37,227
Hello, sir... you..

408
00:30:40,274 --> 00:30:43,039
I am here for this girl..

409
00:30:43,143 --> 00:30:46,044
...because she's going
to a great singer.

410
00:30:47,047 --> 00:30:50,108
<i>But, I can see her future, not you.</i>

411
00:30:52,219 --> 00:30:53,277
One more thing.

412
00:30:55,222 --> 00:30:56,246
You run a bar.

413
00:30:58,025 --> 00:30:59,151
You live off singers.

414
00:31:01,061 --> 00:31:02,256
Learn to respect singers.

415
00:31:04,198 --> 00:31:06,064
Ones that sing at your bar.

416
00:31:07,234 --> 00:31:10,101
And the ones,
whose songs help you run your bar.

417
00:31:11,171 --> 00:31:12,138
Get that.

418
00:31:15,008 --> 00:31:17,102
Vivek, throw the money on his face.

419
00:31:18,178 --> 00:31:20,237
He isn't worthy of any respect.

420
00:31:22,282 --> 00:31:24,046
Let's go, Aarohi.

421
00:31:30,157 --> 00:31:32,057
Okay. Goodbye.

422
00:31:34,128 --> 00:31:35,994
What's all this, Rahul?

423
00:31:37,064 --> 00:31:38,088
This is it.

424
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,159
I pray to Allah that
you're never heart-broken.

425
00:31:42,302 --> 00:31:44,236
If that happens, don't hesitate.

426
00:31:45,005 --> 00:31:48,202
I'll get you work,
and won't taunt you either.

427
00:32:04,224 --> 00:32:06,022
No, no, it's fine.

428
00:32:12,132 --> 00:32:13,156
I'll drop you.

429
00:32:14,268 --> 00:32:15,235
No.

430
00:32:16,036 --> 00:32:19,267
<i>The place I stay,
isn't your standards.</i>

431
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,048
I've noted my number, address..

432
00:32:28,082 --> 00:32:29,208
...and my manager's
number in your diary.

433
00:32:29,216 --> 00:32:32,208
So, call me when you get a new sim.

434
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:33,987
Okay.

435
00:32:34,121 --> 00:32:35,111
Don't forget.

436
00:32:37,291 --> 00:32:39,988
Thank you. - For what?

437
00:32:40,227 --> 00:32:42,059
For giving me new hope.

438
00:32:44,231 --> 00:32:45,995
Bye. - Bye.

439
00:32:58,212 --> 00:32:59,179
Listen.

440
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:01,147
What?

441
00:33:02,015 --> 00:33:02,982
Nothing.

442
00:33:06,086 --> 00:33:07,144
Just like that.

443
00:33:32,146 --> 00:33:34,012
Father!

444
00:33:35,215 --> 00:33:36,182
Aarohi.

445
00:33:41,021 --> 00:33:42,182
You're back. - Yes.

446
00:33:44,191 --> 00:33:46,285
I was thinking about you. - Really?

447
00:33:47,094 --> 00:33:48,186
I even called you in my dreams.

448
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:51,293
Your mother yelled at me. - Why?

449
00:33:52,032 --> 00:33:55,058
She called me crazy. - Father.

450
00:33:58,272 --> 00:34:01,037
But, you left for three months,
didn't you?

451
00:34:01,241 --> 00:34:05,075
And in one month..
- I'll tell you everything.

452
00:34:05,212 --> 00:34:07,010
But where's mother?

453
00:34:07,081 --> 00:34:08,105
At the station.

454
00:34:08,248 --> 00:34:10,046
Today's Thursday.

455
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:12,141
She's gone to buy the
Maharashtra Rajya Lottery.

456
00:34:13,053 --> 00:34:15,021
She's been buying lottery
tickets for the past two years.

457
00:34:15,055 --> 00:34:17,183
But she's never won anything
more than 100 rupees.

458
00:34:19,026 --> 00:34:20,050
Enough!

459
00:34:21,095 --> 00:34:23,223
The daughter's back and
the father can't stop yapping.

460
00:34:24,031 --> 00:34:24,998
Mother.

461
00:34:29,236 --> 00:34:31,136
Why didn't you say you're coming?

462
00:34:31,271 --> 00:34:33,239
I would've prepared
something for you.

463
00:34:34,108 --> 00:34:37,169
We live off on fritters.

464
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:42,171
But now that you're here,
we'll make something nice.

465
00:34:43,016 --> 00:34:45,986
Give me 100 rupees..

466
00:34:46,053 --> 00:34:48,181
...I'll get something
from the market.

467
00:34:49,056 --> 00:34:50,251
We'll make something good today.

468
00:34:54,128 --> 00:34:58,031
Mother, I..

469
00:34:59,032 --> 00:35:01,194
...didn't get paid. - Why?

470
00:35:02,169 --> 00:35:04,035
I met someone.

471
00:35:05,105 --> 00:35:08,166
He said he'll give me a
chance to be a singer, in films.

472
00:35:09,243 --> 00:35:15,148
So I.. - You believed him.
And quit your job.

473
00:35:35,302 --> 00:35:40,035
Mom.

474
00:35:41,208 --> 00:35:43,040
Everything will be okay.

475
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:44,234
Trust..

476
00:35:45,212 --> 00:35:47,078
It's just a matter of few days.

477
00:35:47,181 --> 00:35:50,082
<i>Once I start working.. - $0?</i>

478
00:35:51,185 --> 00:35:53,051
I only have 300 rupees.

479
00:35:54,021 --> 00:35:55,045
300 rupees..

480
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:58,024
Your father doesn't earn a penny.

481
00:35:58,192 --> 00:36:02,129
He.. keeps repairing everyone's
radio and TV's for free.

482
00:36:02,196 --> 00:36:04,164
What are you saying?
- Let me speak.

483
00:36:05,065 --> 00:36:07,159
Is this why I sent
you to the best teachers?

484
00:36:09,069 --> 00:36:10,195
Taught you to speak good Hindi.

485
00:36:11,071 --> 00:36:12,197
So that you can become a great..

486
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:15,108
I stitched clothes
to pay for your fees.

487
00:36:17,111 --> 00:36:19,307
Finally you found a job,
but you quit that as well.

488
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:21,147
And..

489
00:36:24,151 --> 00:36:26,085
<i>I don't win.. the jackpot either.</i>

490
00:36:28,122 --> 00:36:29,180
I thought if you get some money..

491
00:36:29,256 --> 00:36:31,122
<i>.1 will manage a few months.</i>

492
00:36:32,226 --> 00:36:35,218
Now, I'll have to
borrow from someone.

493
00:36:35,262 --> 00:36:37,026
No, mom.

494
00:36:37,164 --> 00:36:39,030
Let's see whether anyone
will lend me money or not. -Mom.

495
00:36:39,099 --> 00:36:42,228
Mom. Mom. Listen to me. - Aarohi.

496
00:36:44,038 --> 00:36:45,164
Let her go.

497
00:36:47,174 --> 00:36:50,235
Actually, it's not her fault.

498
00:36:51,211 --> 00:36:54,181
She's always seen poverty.

499
00:36:55,315 --> 00:36:58,080
<i>And I never gave
her anything either.</i>

500
00:36:58,252 --> 00:36:59,219
But look.

501
00:37:00,287 --> 00:37:04,121
All our hopes are with you.

502
00:37:05,225 --> 00:37:07,250
We want good things for you.

503
00:37:13,067 --> 00:37:14,034
Father.

504
00:37:14,201 --> 00:37:17,102
First time someone's
believed in me.

505
00:37:17,304 --> 00:37:20,103
<i>First time I believed in someone.</i>

506
00:37:20,274 --> 00:37:24,040
He came all the way from Goa,
only for me.

507
00:37:25,279 --> 00:37:28,146
And he's gone to talk
to someone for me, father.

508
00:37:28,215 --> 00:37:30,081
Uncle, I'm not joking.
- Deadlines, boys.

509
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:31,117
There's a girl

510
00:37:34,121 --> 00:37:35,111
Thank God!

511
00:37:36,023 --> 00:37:37,081
Get married, straighten up!

512
00:37:37,124 --> 00:37:39,058
No, no, no, it's not that.

513
00:37:39,093 --> 00:37:40,060
No. - No.

514
00:37:40,294 --> 00:37:44,231
This girl's a very,
very, very, very good singer.

515
00:37:45,199 --> 00:37:47,224
I would've believed you
if you had said "very" once.

516
00:37:47,267 --> 00:37:49,065
Please cancel my
appointment for tomorrow.

517
00:37:49,169 --> 00:37:51,035
She was singing in a bar.

518
00:37:51,171 --> 00:37:53,162
Bar.. you mean where
you were obviously..

519
00:37:54,241 --> 00:37:55,208
Yes..

520
00:37:56,043 --> 00:37:57,169
But, what a voice.

521
00:37:57,211 --> 00:37:59,270
I had an entire bottle,
but I couldn't get drunk.

522
00:38:00,047 --> 00:38:01,208
Can you imagine?
- 15 minutes.

523
00:38:01,281 --> 00:38:04,273
<i>Basically, I want you to
give her a chance to sing in films.</i>

524
00:38:05,018 --> 00:38:06,213
Or, make an album.

525
00:38:07,187 --> 00:38:09,121
<i>She's superb, uncle.
I can write that in blood.</i>

526
00:38:09,223 --> 00:38:10,247
Do you have any blood left?

527
00:38:11,091 --> 00:38:12,024
Where is she?

528
00:38:12,026 --> 00:38:13,084
She stays here in Mumbai.

529
00:38:14,094 --> 00:38:15,152
She's from a poor family..

530
00:38:15,195 --> 00:38:18,028
...and performs out of
the city to make a living.

531
00:38:18,132 --> 00:38:19,190
In these small bars.

532
00:38:20,034 --> 00:38:21,263
But I am not going
to let that happen again.

533
00:38:22,169 --> 00:38:23,295
I really want to help her, uncle.

534
00:38:24,104 --> 00:38:25,162
She's a superstar.

535
00:38:28,242 --> 00:38:30,108
Superstar? - Yeah!

536
00:38:36,316 --> 00:38:42,187
A star, is someone whose songs,
and voice..

537
00:38:43,223 --> 00:38:46,249
...makes you want to..
Whistle.

538
00:38:48,195 --> 00:38:49,253
Whistle.

539
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:53,029
Just like people used
to whistle at your performance.

540
00:38:53,066 --> 00:38:54,158
You were the star. You.

541
00:38:54,268 --> 00:38:56,032
She's better than me.

542
00:38:57,071 --> 00:39:00,006
She's amazing.
I'm telling you, she's amazing.

543
00:39:01,175 --> 00:39:02,142
Call her.

544
00:39:04,111 --> 00:39:06,102
I'll first hear
her and then decide.

545
00:39:06,213 --> 00:39:07,237
You're serious? - Yes.

546
00:39:08,148 --> 00:39:09,115
Yes.

547
00:39:11,151 --> 00:39:13,051
Thank you, uncle.

548
00:39:13,253 --> 00:39:15,153
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

549
00:39:15,222 --> 00:39:17,190
Out. Get out.

550
00:39:17,257 --> 00:39:18,224
Thank you.

551
00:39:19,293 --> 00:39:21,990
Listen to him. He's a good man.

552
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:29,101
Excuse me, give me a simcard.
- Take this.

553
00:39:38,045 --> 00:39:40,309
You are leaving Deepak's show?

554
00:39:43,183 --> 00:39:45,049
You will forget to sing.

555
00:39:55,162 --> 00:39:57,028
Be careful.
Careful, please.

556
00:39:57,097 --> 00:39:58,064
Careful.

557
00:39:59,233 --> 00:40:01,201
Don't you dare tell
anyone about this!

558
00:40:02,035 --> 00:40:04,231
If any journalist or media-person asks you about him..

559
00:40:05,038 --> 00:40:07,200
...then say,
he's gone to London for a show.

560
00:40:08,242 --> 00:40:12,179
In the meanwhile, nobody comes in,
nobody talks to him.

561
00:40:12,246 --> 00:40:13,270
You get that.

562
00:40:21,121 --> 00:40:22,213
Hello. - Hello.

563
00:40:23,157 --> 00:40:26,024
Can I talk to Mr.
Rahul? My name's Aarohi.

564
00:40:26,126 --> 00:40:28,094
He asked me to call me.

565
00:40:28,195 --> 00:40:31,221
I'm a singer, we met in Goa
and he said.. - Rahul isn't here.

566
00:40:32,199 --> 00:40:34,258
He's gone to London, for his shows.

567
00:40:34,301 --> 00:40:37,202
And he'll return after 20-25 days.
- 20-25 days?

568
00:40:39,206 --> 00:40:41,174
Yes, but just listen to me..

569
00:40:42,109 --> 00:40:44,009
Hello! Hello!

570
00:40:52,252 --> 00:41:00,252
"It's your fault, my heart!"

571
00:41:04,164 --> 00:41:11,127
"Why did you trust him?"

572
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:16,271
"All the promises were fake."

573
00:41:19,046 --> 00:41:22,209
"The one you followed here."

574
00:41:23,183 --> 00:41:31,183
"Beloved's nowhere."

575
00:41:36,196 --> 00:41:42,033
"Now, stop seeing those dreams."

576
00:41:42,169 --> 00:41:47,005
'Now, shatter those
dreams yourself."

577
00:41:47,041 --> 00:41:51,274
"Beloved's nowhere."

578
00:41:52,012 --> 00:41:53,138
We don't have evidence..

579
00:41:54,181 --> 00:41:55,239
...whether Deepak's involved or not.

580
00:41:56,083 --> 00:41:58,108
<i>But I swear Rahul.</i>

581
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:02,180
I will find out whoever he is and..

582
00:42:06,093 --> 00:42:07,254
Did Aarohi call?

583
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:11,097
Not yet.

584
00:42:11,131 --> 00:42:12,223
Is your phone on?

585
00:42:15,269 --> 00:42:16,236
2417,

586
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:28,205
Tell this girl that
it's a wrong number.

587
00:42:30,184 --> 00:42:31,208
Hello. - Hello.

588
00:42:31,318 --> 00:42:33,082
Hello, is Rahul back.

589
00:42:33,287 --> 00:42:34,277
I am sorry, this is a wrong number.

590
00:42:35,122 --> 00:42:36,089
What?

591
00:42:36,323 --> 00:42:38,087
Hello. Hello.

592
00:42:39,293 --> 00:42:47,293
"There's punishment
for every mistake."

593
00:42:51,171 --> 00:42:56,200
"If you're destined for sadness."

594
00:42:56,277 --> 00:43:02,011
"“There's always a reason."

595
00:43:03,217 --> 00:43:08,246
"All my pain has
conjured in my tears."

596
00:43:09,156 --> 00:43:13,992
"My tears don't
stop trickling down."

597
00:43:14,061 --> 00:43:22,061
"Beloved's nowhere."

598
00:43:29,043 --> 00:43:31,171
Okay. Give the money.

599
00:43:35,149 --> 00:43:37,174
See you. Goodbye.

600
00:43:53,167 --> 00:43:56,137
This fracture showed
me the importance of my legs.

601
00:43:56,203 --> 00:43:57,193
Take care.

602
00:44:01,175 --> 00:44:02,233
Great.

603
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:04,077
Good news.

604
00:44:04,178 --> 00:44:06,010
It's time to celebrate.

605
00:44:07,014 --> 00:44:08,243
I'll have a drink with you as well.

606
00:44:10,217 --> 00:44:12,117
Where to? - To look for Aarohi.

607
00:44:14,021 --> 00:44:14,988
Come on.

608
00:44:15,089 --> 00:44:17,183
Excuse me, is this Rahul's house?

609
00:44:17,291 --> 00:44:19,123
Yes, this is his home.

610
00:44:19,193 --> 00:44:21,059
But, sir's out of town.

611
00:44:21,061 --> 00:44:22,256
I don't know when he's coming back.

612
00:44:26,166 --> 00:44:29,136
Vivek sir said he'll be
coming back after 20-25 days.

613
00:44:30,170 --> 00:44:32,036
It's been two months now.

614
00:44:32,072 --> 00:44:33,062
He hasn't returned.

615
00:44:33,107 --> 00:44:34,199
<i>What can I do if he hasn't?</i>

616
00:44:34,241 --> 00:44:36,107
I'll let you know
once he comes back.

617
00:44:36,176 --> 00:44:37,143
Please leave.

618
00:44:43,217 --> 00:44:45,185
Please give this top
Rahul sir when he returns.

619
00:44:49,056 --> 00:44:50,217
Tell him Aarohi was here.

620
00:44:51,258 --> 00:44:53,022
I tried calling him many times.

621
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:54,221
I'll give it to
him once he returns.

622
00:44:54,261 --> 00:44:56,025
Please go now.

623
00:45:27,094 --> 00:45:29,028
Coming!

624
00:45:32,266 --> 00:45:33,995
What happend?

625
00:45:36,270 --> 00:45:37,999
Sister-in-law, Salim.

626
00:45:38,105 --> 00:45:39,971
Aarohi. What's wrong?

627
00:45:41,041 --> 00:45:42,008
Salim.

628
00:45:42,109 --> 00:45:43,235
What's wrong? Who is it?

629
00:45:51,118 --> 00:45:52,210
What's wrong, Aarohi?

630
00:45:53,053 --> 00:45:54,179
I want a job.

631
00:45:57,124 --> 00:46:01,254
Any place. Good, bad or cheap.

632
00:46:02,196 --> 00:46:03,186
Just get me work.

633
00:46:04,098 --> 00:46:06,123
I need money, Salim.

634
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:08,132
Come in.

635
00:46:12,072 --> 00:46:14,234
Sir. A girl gave this.

636
00:46:17,177 --> 00:46:18,008
When did she come?

637
00:46:18,045 --> 00:46:19,103
Yesterday evening.

638
00:46:19,146 --> 00:46:21,205
She said she called
you two-three times.

639
00:46:21,282 --> 00:46:23,250
Maybe she spoke to Vivek sir.

640
00:46:24,051 --> 00:46:27,021
<i>She looked decent, so I told you.</i>

641
00:46:28,288 --> 00:46:30,222
Thank you. - Welcome sir.

642
00:46:36,029 --> 00:46:37,190
What the hell is wrong with you?

643
00:46:37,264 --> 00:46:39,130
<i>Don't ask why I did that?</i>

644
00:46:39,266 --> 00:46:40,233
You know.

645
00:46:42,002 --> 00:46:44,266
I told that girl never
to sing in a bar again.

646
00:46:45,039 --> 00:46:47,064
I told her she'll
be a successful singer.

647
00:46:47,107 --> 00:46:49,075
I told her she will be a star.

648
00:46:51,178 --> 00:46:52,270
I went to her hotel, Vivek.

649
00:46:53,013 --> 00:46:54,071
She didn't come to me.

650
00:46:54,181 --> 00:46:55,239
And what did you do?

651
00:46:56,050 --> 00:46:57,142
You humiliated her.

652
00:46:57,251 --> 00:46:59,015
You hid her calls from me.

653
00:46:59,319 --> 00:47:01,014
You lied to her.

654
00:47:02,056 --> 00:47:05,219
You treated her like an enemy.
- Yes, because I'm your friend.

655
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:08,058
I've been with you for years.

656
00:47:08,262 --> 00:47:10,230
You could've shown
some respect for me.

657
00:47:10,297 --> 00:47:13,995
And for any darn girl..
- She's no ordinary girl!

658
00:47:16,069 --> 00:47:17,195
<i>This is why I did it.</i>

659
00:47:18,138 --> 00:47:19,264
So that you stay away from her.

660
00:47:20,307 --> 00:47:22,207
<i>I didn't want this to happen, man!</i>

661
00:47:24,011 --> 00:47:26,070
First alcohol, then drugs.

662
00:47:26,213 --> 00:47:29,183
<i>And now.. - Whatever I do
with my life is my problem, Vivek.</i>

663
00:47:29,249 --> 00:47:30,080
No!

664
00:47:30,117 --> 00:47:31,243
This isn't your personal problem.

665
00:47:31,318 --> 00:47:33,047
I've been with you for 10 years.

666
00:47:33,187 --> 00:47:35,178
I looked after you, your career.

667
00:47:35,255 --> 00:47:37,986
I saw your success, your downfall.

668
00:47:38,092 --> 00:47:42,029
<i>But, I can't see you
handing over your success..</i>

669
00:47:42,096 --> 00:47:44,087
...which you need the most now,
to some girl.

670
00:47:44,298 --> 00:47:47,996
I can't see you doing
this for someone else instead.

671
00:47:48,235 --> 00:47:51,170
I feel sad. It hurts me.

672
00:47:51,271 --> 00:47:55,003
To know that you've stopped
recognizing your talent.

673
00:47:55,275 --> 00:47:58,176
You've forgotten your own voice.

674
00:47:59,012 --> 00:48:00,980
One that's unmatched.

675
00:48:01,181 --> 00:48:02,148
Why?

676
00:48:02,283 --> 00:48:04,217
Why don't you see yourself?

677
00:48:04,284 --> 00:48:06,218
Why don't you hear yourself?

678
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:08,186
You call me your enemy.

679
00:48:09,256 --> 00:48:12,248
Just.. look at yourself.

680
00:48:15,229 --> 00:48:16,253
You're right.

681
00:48:18,165 --> 00:48:20,224
But the truth is,
ll don't want anything.

682
00:48:21,201 --> 00:48:25,229
Fame, fortune,
success, money, respect.

683
00:48:26,073 --> 00:48:28,235
It should all go to
the one that deserves it.

684
00:48:29,243 --> 00:48:32,008
Give the bread to the
one that's hungry for it.

685
00:48:33,013 --> 00:48:35,243
And I've seen that in that girl.

686
00:48:37,084 --> 00:48:38,245
<i>And I no longer have that.</i>

687
00:48:39,219 --> 00:48:41,017
And I've admitted this truth.

688
00:48:41,221 --> 00:48:42,279
You should too.

689
00:48:43,223 --> 00:48:45,214
Your friend can't pay
you your salary anymore.

690
00:48:46,093 --> 00:48:48,221
RJ. - You're a free man, Vivek.

691
00:48:49,263 --> 00:48:51,231
You can go anywhere you want.

692
00:49:05,012 --> 00:49:05,979
Hello.

693
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:08,014
<i>Can I talk to Aarohi, please?</i>

694
00:49:08,048 --> 00:49:10,016
She's performing? - Where?

695
00:49:10,117 --> 00:49:11,209
Hotel Nightingale.

696
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:19,025
"What seemed like reality,
turned out to be an illusion."

697
00:49:19,093 --> 00:49:24,156
'A saga, that was bound
for a twist, has ended."

698
00:49:24,231 --> 00:49:27,064
"I forgot, so did she.”

699
00:49:27,167 --> 00:49:33,265
<i>“How do I tell
everyone about this?"</i>

700
00:49:34,108 --> 00:49:39,137
"I've slowly compromised myself."

701
00:49:40,013 --> 00:49:44,177
"I've slowly controlled myself."

702
00:49:44,251 --> 00:49:52,251
"Beloved's nowhere."

703
00:50:03,204 --> 00:50:11,204
"It's your fault, my heart!"

704
00:50:15,082 --> 00:50:21,180
"Why did you trust him?"

705
00:50:23,123 --> 00:50:24,181
Aarohi! Aarohi!

706
00:50:24,258 --> 00:50:25,191
Please let me explain.

707
00:50:25,259 --> 00:50:28,024
<i>Look. I work here.</i>

708
00:50:28,062 --> 00:50:29,188
Don't create a scene.

709
00:50:30,030 --> 00:50:31,191
I got this job with
great difficulty.

710
00:50:31,231 --> 00:50:33,131
<i>Damn the job,
1 want to speak to you.</i>

711
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:34,258
Why should 1?

712
00:50:35,169 --> 00:50:37,069
I've been waiting for two months.

713
00:50:37,171 --> 00:50:40,163
<i>First time I hurt my
parents and trusted someone.</i>

714
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:42,072
I started dreaming.

715
00:50:43,177 --> 00:50:45,111
Everything seemed true.

716
00:50:45,212 --> 00:50:46,236
What now?

717
00:50:48,215 --> 00:50:49,182
Go ahead.

718
00:50:50,184 --> 00:50:52,152
You can vent all your anger.

719
00:50:53,253 --> 00:50:55,153
I am your culprit.

720
00:50:57,224 --> 00:50:58,248
<i>But, I am not.</i>

721
00:51:00,227 --> 00:51:01,285
I waited for you.

722
00:51:02,262 --> 00:51:04,026
Get in.

723
00:51:04,131 --> 00:51:05,098
Come on. - What are you doing?

724
00:51:05,165 --> 00:51:07,133
Get in. - What are you doing?

725
00:51:07,268 --> 00:51:09,168
What are you doing? - Come on.

726
00:51:10,270 --> 00:51:12,068
I want to tell you a story.

727
00:51:15,008 --> 00:51:16,976
I don't want to hear your story.

728
00:51:23,017 --> 00:51:23,984
Let's go.

729
00:51:54,248 --> 00:51:56,182
If all that happened with you..

730
00:51:57,151 --> 00:51:59,017
...then, why didn't
they show it on TV?

731
00:51:59,053 --> 00:52:00,111
Aarohi, the TV..

732
00:52:01,021 --> 00:52:02,113
Please forget it.

733
00:52:02,323 --> 00:52:04,189
I want to keep my promise.

734
00:52:06,093 --> 00:52:08,061
In fact I brought
Sehgal uncle along.

735
00:52:09,029 --> 00:52:10,190
He's called you at his office.

736
00:52:13,133 --> 00:52:15,101
<i>But, I cannot quit this job.</i>

737
00:52:19,306 --> 00:52:21,104
I cannot take a risk again.

738
00:52:21,241 --> 00:52:22,231
Then don't..

739
00:52:23,043 --> 00:52:25,171
You can keep the job
until you're satisfied.

740
00:52:25,279 --> 00:52:28,078
But, you've believed me so far,
then why not another day.

741
00:52:31,218 --> 00:52:33,084
Be ready at 11 am tomorrow.

742
00:52:35,122 --> 00:52:36,089
Please.

743
00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:40,227
Please!

744
00:52:43,164 --> 00:52:44,996
You sing well, dear.

745
00:52:45,232 --> 00:52:46,199
You're talented.

746
00:52:47,067 --> 00:52:48,193
And you understand tunes.

747
00:52:49,069 --> 00:52:52,039
But, for playback
singing and albums..

748
00:52:52,306 --> 00:52:55,105
...you'll need some grooming.

749
00:52:55,242 --> 00:52:56,971
Just a little.

750
00:52:58,112 --> 00:53:01,082
Because singing in recording
studios with new songs..

751
00:53:01,181 --> 00:53:04,014
...can get a little overwhelming.
- Okay.

752
00:53:04,251 --> 00:53:08,119
Fine.. we'll start your
vocal training from next week.

753
00:53:09,056 --> 00:53:10,023
Yes, I'll do that.

754
00:53:10,090 --> 00:53:12,115
I'll train her. - Fantastic!

755
00:53:12,259 --> 00:53:13,988
What else do you want?

756
00:53:21,235 --> 00:53:23,260
So many awards, records.

757
00:53:25,072 --> 00:53:26,164
They're all yours.

758
00:53:27,074 --> 00:53:30,237
<i>They're mine, or not. I don't know.</i>

759
00:53:31,145 --> 00:53:32,112
What?

760
00:53:32,146 --> 00:53:33,170
Nothing.

761
00:53:34,148 --> 00:53:35,115
Don't worry.

762
00:53:35,182 --> 00:53:38,015
Someday you'll
come with your award.

763
00:53:38,185 --> 00:53:39,983
You'll have more awards than me.

764
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:41,087
I promise.

765
00:53:54,067 --> 00:53:55,034
What?

766
00:53:57,070 --> 00:53:58,037
Nothing.

767
00:54:00,241 --> 00:54:02,005
Just like that.

768
00:54:22,162 --> 00:54:23,186
I can't do it.

769
00:54:24,264 --> 00:54:26,096
Okay, listen. I will show you.

770
00:54:26,166 --> 00:54:27,224
It's in B flat.

771
00:54:29,236 --> 00:54:36,040
<i>“Just tell me,
whether I want it or not."</i>

772
00:54:38,112 --> 00:54:45,018
<i>“Show me the way to your heart,
whether I want it or not."</i>

773
00:54:48,222 --> 00:54:50,020
You sing so well.

774
00:54:51,025 --> 00:54:52,993
It's your training not me.

775
00:54:54,094 --> 00:54:55,220
Let's start singing.

776
00:54:56,163 --> 00:55:03,194
<i>“Just tell me,
whether I want it or not."</i>

777
00:55:05,172 --> 00:55:12,044
<i>“Show me the way to your heart,
whether I want it or not."</i>

778
00:55:14,181 --> 00:55:22,181
"Let me tell you, that
I don't have faith in my love."

779
00:55:23,157 --> 00:55:25,148
"still, the heart thought.."

780
00:55:25,226 --> 00:55:32,064
"..now that we're here,
why not ask.”

781
00:55:32,166 --> 00:55:38,264
<i>“Just tell me,
whether I want it or not."</i>

782
00:55:41,108 --> 00:55:48,014
<i>“Show me the way to your heart,
whether I want it or not."</i>

783
00:56:08,001 --> 00:56:16,001
"I never had such desires before."

784
00:56:17,010 --> 00:56:25,010
"I never tried this
hard to meet anyone.™

785
00:56:26,119 --> 00:56:33,025
<i>“Solve my confusion,
whether I want it or not."</i>

786
00:56:35,095 --> 00:56:42,024
<i>“Express it through your eyes,
whether I want it or not."</i>

787
00:56:43,036 --> 00:56:46,165
Aarohi! Aarohi! Aarohi!

788
00:56:49,143 --> 00:56:50,269
Ladies and Gentlemen.

789
00:56:51,045 --> 00:56:54,015
The time has come,
for me to introduce you all..

790
00:56:54,081 --> 00:56:57,016
...to the nightingale of India,
and our country's..

791
00:56:57,051 --> 00:56:59,019
...latest singing sensation.

792
00:56:59,086 --> 00:57:02,112
The beautiful,
the talented, the wonderful!

793
00:57:02,156 --> 00:57:05,990
Aarohi Keshav Shirke!

794
00:57:23,077 --> 00:57:24,044
Yes, dad.

795
00:57:24,111 --> 00:57:25,237
Rahul. How are you, son?

796
00:57:26,213 --> 00:57:28,272
Everything fine?
- Everything fine, dad.

797
00:57:30,017 --> 00:57:31,143
In fact, I'm really happy.

798
00:57:33,053 --> 00:57:34,111
<i>After along time.</i>

799
00:57:35,022 --> 00:57:37,013
You're in love, huh!

800
00:57:37,124 --> 00:57:41,186
"Just tell me..

801
00:57:43,063 --> 00:57:44,053
How did you know?

802
00:57:44,231 --> 00:57:45,995
I'm your father.

803
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:48,029
Come.

804
00:57:48,102 --> 00:57:51,037
When the son's in love,
the father knows.

805
00:57:52,039 --> 00:58:00,038
<i>“Show me the way to your heart,
whether I want it or not."</i>

806
00:58:17,131 --> 00:58:18,064
What happened?

807
00:58:18,065 --> 00:58:20,033
Sir, she needs five more minutes.

808
00:58:23,070 --> 00:58:25,004
It's been half an hour, Rahul.

809
00:58:25,205 --> 00:58:27,230
Is there a problem?
- No, sir. There's no problem.

810
00:58:36,283 --> 00:58:37,250
Aarohi.

811
00:58:41,021 --> 00:58:41,988
Come out.

812
00:58:50,164 --> 00:58:51,131
Let's go.

813
00:58:59,039 --> 00:59:00,302
I cannot sing.

814
00:59:03,210 --> 00:59:05,144
Aarohi, we all get nervous.

815
00:59:07,181 --> 00:59:08,148
I was too.

816
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:11,048
I ran away from the studio.

817
00:59:13,020 --> 00:59:13,987
It's okay.

818
00:59:14,288 --> 00:59:15,255
No.

819
00:59:19,026 --> 00:59:20,289
The bar was a different story.

820
00:59:22,196 --> 00:59:24,255
Making mistakes were okay.

821
00:59:26,133 --> 00:59:28,295
But, here..
amongst these big people..

822
00:59:29,036 --> 00:59:30,162
You're not alone.

823
00:59:32,239 --> 00:59:33,263
I am with you.

824
00:59:37,044 --> 00:59:38,102
Please, come out.

825
00:59:43,083 --> 00:59:45,017
I cannot sing.

826
00:59:54,061 --> 00:59:55,153
<i>Aarohi, I love you.</i>

827
00:59:59,032 --> 01:00:00,022
ll love you.

828
01:00:03,170 --> 01:00:05,104
I've waited too long for this day.

829
01:00:06,273 --> 01:00:08,002
More than you.

830
01:00:09,276 --> 01:00:11,244
Come out for me.

831
01:00:14,148 --> 01:00:15,115
Please.

832
01:00:36,136 --> 01:00:40,164
“I've small dreams."

833
01:00:41,041 --> 01:00:45,035
"Dreams have songs."

834
01:00:45,179 --> 01:00:49,207
"Songs have life."

835
01:00:50,050 --> 01:00:53,247
"Love and affection."

836
01:00:54,121 --> 01:00:58,183
"I don't dream any longer."

837
01:00:59,026 --> 01:01:02,985
“That's without you."

838
01:01:03,197 --> 01:01:11,196
<i>“I'm finally saying,
what I didn't so far."</i>

839
01:01:11,305 --> 01:01:19,305
“The heart trusts you,
more than me."

840
01:01:20,314 --> 01:01:25,081
"1 weave dreams about us,
in my empty moments."

841
01:01:25,152 --> 01:01:29,180
"You're in love with me."

842
01:01:29,323 --> 01:01:37,253
“I'll never ask you,
whether I want to or not."

843
01:01:39,033 --> 01:01:47,033
"I want to live in your dreams,
because I want to." - Fantastic.

844
01:01:49,209 --> 01:01:50,199
Really nice.

845
01:02:16,203 --> 01:02:18,001
Ladies and Gentlemen.

846
01:02:18,105 --> 01:02:21,234
Welcome to the Indian Music Awards.

847
01:02:23,177 --> 01:02:24,144
Finally!

848
01:02:24,278 --> 01:02:27,270
Uncle. Where's Rahul?
- We're waiting for you.

849
01:02:29,083 --> 01:02:30,175
When you can't
find Rahul anywhere..

850
01:02:30,250 --> 01:02:32,184
...you must always check the bar.

851
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:36,181
But, it's such a big day
of my life, he should be with me.

852
01:02:36,256 --> 01:02:38,020
I've been nominated.

853
01:02:38,092 --> 01:02:39,059
I understand..

854
01:02:39,126 --> 01:02:40,184
Mom and dad are here.

855
01:02:40,227 --> 01:02:41,217
I'll just..

856
01:02:42,029 --> 01:02:44,191
Come. Please come.

857
01:02:47,001 --> 01:02:48,992
Come on, he'll be here. Come on.

858
01:02:49,169 --> 01:02:51,137
Please.

859
01:02:52,206 --> 01:02:54,197
Aarohi! Aarohi!

860
01:02:57,244 --> 01:02:58,211
Come here.

861
01:03:00,214 --> 01:03:02,012
Looking for me?

862
01:03:02,216 --> 01:03:03,240
You scared me.

863
01:03:04,184 --> 01:03:06,050
Where were you? - Forget that.

864
01:03:06,086 --> 01:03:07,178
How do you feel?

865
01:03:08,021 --> 01:03:09,045
It's useless.

866
01:03:11,158 --> 01:03:13,252
Wonder where you
keep disappearing to?

867
01:03:15,062 --> 01:03:16,154
I was at the bar.

868
01:03:17,064 --> 01:03:20,193
If you drink so much, how
will you recognize me in the crowd?

869
01:03:21,068 --> 01:03:22,035
1 will.

870
01:03:23,304 --> 01:03:28,037
Amongst,
thousands, million, billions.

871
01:03:29,243 --> 01:03:33,180
I can forget myself, but not you.

872
01:03:38,218 --> 01:03:40,084
When did you fall so
deeply in love with me?

873
01:03:40,154 --> 01:03:41,087
Hi, ma'am!

874
01:03:41,155 --> 01:03:42,213
I'm from CNTV Live.

875
01:03:42,323 --> 01:03:44,257
<i>Do you mind if I
take a small interwiew?</i>

876
01:03:45,192 --> 01:03:46,250
Please. Just for five minutes.

877
01:03:47,027 --> 01:03:49,155
No, right now I.. - Just a second.

878
01:03:50,030 --> 01:03:51,054
Never do that.

879
01:03:51,265 --> 01:03:53,029
Okay. Never do that.

880
01:03:54,301 --> 01:03:58,033
Go. Time to touch the moon.

881
01:03:59,273 --> 01:04:00,263
Go get them.

882
01:04:08,015 --> 01:04:10,279
Ladies and Gentlemen.
Moving on the next award.

883
01:04:11,185 --> 01:04:13,244
Nidhi Chaudhary for "Aa jara"

884
01:04:15,189 --> 01:04:16,247
Listen. - Yes, sir.

885
01:04:17,124 --> 01:04:19,024
Did you get the bottle from home?
- No, sir.

886
01:04:19,093 --> 01:04:20,185
Then, why are you being a miser?
Pour some more.

887
01:04:20,260 --> 01:04:21,250
Sorry, sir.

888
01:04:24,298 --> 01:04:26,164
And award goes to..

889
01:04:27,267 --> 01:04:29,258
Aarohi Keshav Shirke.

890
01:04:43,283 --> 01:04:44,250
She won!

891
01:04:46,053 --> 01:04:47,020
Thank you.

892
01:04:48,222 --> 01:04:49,280
The girl sings well.

893
01:04:50,090 --> 01:04:51,057
She's very good.

894
01:04:51,125 --> 01:04:53,093
I heard she was offered
to sing in films too.

895
01:04:53,193 --> 01:04:54,251
But she refused.

896
01:04:55,129 --> 01:04:56,119
She'll say yes.

897
01:04:56,196 --> 01:04:58,130
Everyone wants to be a star.

898
01:05:01,268 --> 01:05:04,135
Of course, she will be.

899
01:05:04,238 --> 01:05:07,208
But, not a star, a maid.

900
01:05:09,043 --> 01:05:11,978
What's that singer's name?
That star.

901
01:05:12,046 --> 01:05:13,070
Rahul.

902
01:05:14,114 --> 01:05:16,082
She'll be his maid.

903
01:05:17,017 --> 01:05:18,212
And later, his nurse.

904
01:05:19,153 --> 01:05:21,121
Come on. He loves her.

905
01:05:22,022 --> 01:05:23,080
He's made her.

906
01:05:23,223 --> 01:05:26,249
She made it this
far because of him.

907
01:05:26,293 --> 01:05:29,092
<i>That's what I am
trying to tell you.</i>

908
01:05:29,263 --> 01:05:33,131
The higher she climbs
the ladder of success..

909
01:05:33,267 --> 01:05:36,100
...the lower she'll
fall because of Rahul.

910
01:05:36,270 --> 01:05:39,103
She belongs to a poor family,
after all.

911
01:05:40,207 --> 01:05:42,266
That's why RJ's taken her in.

912
01:05:43,143 --> 01:05:46,044
So that he can make her serve him.

913
01:05:46,246 --> 01:05:50,080
Keep her awake all night,
for his entertainment.

914
01:05:51,018 --> 01:05:54,147
To vent out the
anger of his failure.

915
01:05:55,089 --> 01:06:00,186
And as days will go by,
he will start hitting her.

916
01:06:01,261 --> 01:06:04,162
He'll beat her every day,
humiliate her.

917
01:06:06,066 --> 01:06:08,057
And once he falls sick..

918
01:06:08,268 --> 01:06:11,260
...she'll be cleaning his pukes.

919
01:06:13,107 --> 01:06:14,131
Remember this.

920
01:06:15,242 --> 01:06:17,267
Often, those who light the lamp..

921
01:06:18,078 --> 01:06:19,307
...are the ones that douse it later.

922
01:06:22,016 --> 01:06:26,010
There have been many
such stories in the industry.

923
01:06:26,153 --> 01:06:28,053
Another glass of whiskey.

924
01:06:52,112 --> 01:07:00,112
Rahul!

925
01:07:58,112 --> 01:08:01,047
Rahul. What are you doing?
Get down.

926
01:08:06,287 --> 01:08:09,052
Finally, you touched the moon.

927
01:08:10,291 --> 01:08:14,125
You were looking very beautiful
on the big screen with the award.

928
01:08:16,063 --> 01:08:20,091
Does this bottle
look nice in my hands?

929
01:08:28,309 --> 01:08:30,004
It doesn't.

930
01:08:33,214 --> 01:08:35,012
But what to do.

931
01:08:36,150 --> 01:08:38,244
I just can't let go.

932
01:08:46,093 --> 01:08:49,996
Rahul. - No, no, wait.

933
01:08:51,065 --> 01:08:53,193
<i>After I got my first
break without any struggle..</i>

934
01:08:55,202 --> 01:08:59,196
.-1 got fame, fortune, status.

935
01:09:01,275 --> 01:09:05,007
The world was at my feet.

936
01:09:05,279 --> 01:09:07,111
<i>But, I didn't know what to do.</i>

937
01:09:09,016 --> 01:09:10,177
I couldn't handle the fame..

938
01:09:12,152 --> 01:09:13,210
...OF my senses.

939
01:09:14,221 --> 01:09:16,121
That was the condition yesterday..

940
01:09:16,323 --> 01:09:18,257
...it's still the same today.

941
01:09:19,093 --> 01:09:20,219
And it'll always stay that way.

942
01:09:20,260 --> 01:09:23,093
Rahul. What are you doing?

943
01:09:24,265 --> 01:09:26,063
What are you doing?

944
01:09:26,133 --> 01:09:27,259
Why are you doing this?

945
01:09:31,038 --> 01:09:33,063
We'll have to end
this relation here.

946
01:09:35,242 --> 01:09:36,209
Now.

947
01:09:38,112 --> 01:09:39,204
Nothing's lost yet.

948
01:09:41,248 --> 01:09:43,148
We aren't so close.

949
01:09:44,084 --> 01:09:45,984
We can live without each other.

950
01:09:47,154 --> 01:09:49,020
You're successful now, Aarohi.

951
01:09:51,058 --> 01:09:52,253
You've everything.

952
01:09:54,128 --> 01:09:56,096
Go, live your life.

953
01:09:57,231 --> 01:09:59,063
My habits have scared me.

954
01:10:02,069 --> 01:10:04,060
I don't know my future.

955
01:10:05,172 --> 01:10:08,267
<i>What I might turn into.</i>

956
01:10:09,276 --> 01:10:11,244
<i>How I may treat you.</i>

957
01:10:13,013 --> 01:10:15,983
It doesn't take long for
one to turn into the devil.

958
01:10:17,284 --> 01:10:20,015
<i>So, why should I hold you back?</i>

959
01:10:23,023 --> 01:10:24,081
I can't do this.

960
01:10:39,273 --> 01:10:42,106
Then.. then..

961
01:10:43,244 --> 01:10:45,042
Leave this habit.

962
01:10:46,047 --> 01:10:47,014
Leave it.

963
01:10:48,115 --> 01:10:49,139
It's no good.

964
01:10:50,150 --> 01:10:51,982
I'll help you.

965
01:10:52,086 --> 01:10:53,178
I'll help you leave it.

966
01:10:53,254 --> 01:10:55,985
Just give me a chance..
- I can never leave it.

967
01:10:57,158 --> 01:11:01,152
It's like a wife,
that won't ever leave me alone.

968
01:11:02,296 --> 01:11:04,128
So, listen to me.

969
01:11:04,264 --> 01:11:06,130
You'll be happier without me.

970
01:11:08,102 --> 01:11:12,972
That means, you can live
with this habit, but not me.

971
01:11:15,276 --> 01:11:16,243
Rahul.

972
01:11:17,111 --> 01:11:20,206
Love is not a joke.
- But my life is.

973
01:11:22,249 --> 01:11:25,219
But, you always had this habit.

974
01:11:28,022 --> 01:11:31,981
If you were so scared,
why did you come so close?

975
01:11:33,160 --> 01:11:35,128
You should've stayed away.
- Exactly.

976
01:11:36,197 --> 01:11:38,131
<i>Until now, I was my own enemy!</i>

977
01:11:38,299 --> 01:11:41,166
<i>And before I become a
threat to you, just go away!</i>

978
01:11:47,041 --> 01:11:48,008
Fine.

979
01:11:50,044 --> 01:11:51,170
I am going.

980
01:11:52,313 --> 01:11:56,147
Away, from you and this success.

981
01:11:57,251 --> 01:12:00,186
Don't misjudge your success.

982
01:12:02,022 --> 01:12:04,081
Only a few fortune people get it.

983
01:12:05,092 --> 01:12:06,059
I know.

984
01:12:07,094 --> 01:12:10,257
And also that,
you were with me in my bad times.

985
01:12:11,298 --> 01:12:13,266
But if you're not with
me in my good times..

986
01:12:14,168 --> 01:12:16,034
<i>.Then I don't want it.</i>

987
01:12:36,023 --> 01:12:36,990
Aarohi!

988
01:12:37,191 --> 01:12:39,159
Aarohi! Aarohi!

989
01:12:40,027 --> 01:12:41,153
Aarohi, listen!

990
01:12:45,199 --> 01:12:50,160
I can't live without you."

991
01:12:50,237 --> 01:12:55,175
"I don't exist without you."

992
01:13:00,247 --> 01:13:05,242
I can't live without you."

993
01:13:06,020 --> 01:13:10,218
"I don't exist without you."

994
01:13:11,025 --> 01:13:19,025
'If I separate from you,
I'll lose myself."

995
01:13:23,170 --> 01:13:28,074
"Because it's you.. it's you."

996
01:13:28,275 --> 01:13:33,213
"You're my life."

997
01:13:34,048 --> 01:13:38,144
"My relief, my pain."

998
01:13:38,252 --> 01:13:44,055
"You're my love."

999
01:14:04,244 --> 01:14:12,244
"We can't stay away a moment."

1000
01:14:14,321 --> 01:14:19,259
"Il live only for you."

1001
01:14:20,027 --> 01:14:24,157
"All my time is devoted to you."

1002
01:14:24,231 --> 01:14:29,135
"I can't live a
moment without you."

1003
01:14:29,270 --> 01:14:36,233
"Each breath's just for you."

1004
01:14:37,177 --> 01:14:42,138
"Because it's you.. it's you."

1005
01:14:42,282 --> 01:14:48,016
"You're my life."

1006
01:14:48,055 --> 01:14:52,151
"My relief, my pain."

1007
01:14:52,259 --> 01:14:57,197
"You're my love."

1008
01:15:07,174 --> 01:15:09,142
Uncle one second wait uncle.

1009
01:15:14,148 --> 01:15:17,015
Yes uncle don't worry.

1010
01:15:17,184 --> 01:15:19,152
Aarohi! - Yes, mom.

1011
01:15:21,121 --> 01:15:27,026
Dear, you're getting in
a live-in relation with him.

1012
01:15:27,261 --> 01:15:30,094
Without marriage?

1013
01:15:32,066 --> 01:15:35,297
What's the world going to say?

1014
01:15:38,139 --> 01:15:41,165
This is my world..

1015
01:15:44,078 --> 01:15:45,307
...that's it.

1016
01:16:01,162 --> 01:16:06,123
"I lived only for you."

1017
01:16:06,167 --> 01:16:11,196
"I've surrendered myself."

1018
01:16:11,272 --> 01:16:16,142
"Your loyalty supported me."

1019
01:16:16,243 --> 01:16:22,012
"It cured all my pain."

1020
01:16:22,116 --> 01:16:27,054
"My destiny's tied with you."

1021
01:16:27,187 --> 01:16:32,091
"You made me complete.”

1022
01:16:35,095 --> 01:16:40,033
"Because it's you.. it's you."

1023
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:45,229
"You're my life."

1024
01:16:45,272 --> 01:16:50,039
"My relief, my pain."

1025
01:16:50,177 --> 01:16:55,115
"You're my love."

1026
01:16:55,216 --> 01:17:00,154
"Because it's you.. it's you."

1027
01:17:01,055 --> 01:17:05,185
"You're my life."

1028
01:17:06,093 --> 01:17:10,087
"My relief, my pain."

1029
01:17:11,031 --> 01:17:15,264
"You're my love."

1030
01:17:30,284 --> 01:17:31,251
Sir.

1031
01:17:33,020 --> 01:17:35,011
Sir, Vivek's here to see you.

1032
01:17:36,123 --> 01:17:37,284
He has won our heart.

1033
01:17:38,125 --> 01:17:40,116
And today for his new song..

1034
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:43,152
..."YARA' he is going to be
honored with the national award.

1035
01:17:44,031 --> 01:17:47,160
Now Aarohi's name will
be written in history.

1036
01:17:55,175 --> 01:17:56,142
Hi.

1037
01:18:00,214 --> 01:18:02,080
I came to apologize.

1038
01:18:07,221 --> 01:18:09,155
<i>What I did..</i>

1039
01:18:11,091 --> 01:18:13,185
ll shouldn't have done..
- Forget it.

1040
01:18:15,129 --> 01:18:16,096
Forget it.

1041
01:18:18,099 --> 01:18:21,034
I thought you would still
be angry.. - Forget it.

1042
01:18:22,069 --> 01:18:23,002
What will you drink?

1043
01:18:23,070 --> 01:18:25,266
Enough. Stop. What are you doing?

1044
01:18:34,148 --> 01:18:35,240
Is there any work?

1045
01:18:39,153 --> 01:18:40,120
What?

1046
01:18:40,221 --> 01:18:41,211
I want to work.

1047
01:18:41,322 --> 01:18:43,051
I am not alone.

1048
01:18:43,257 --> 01:18:44,224
There is.

1049
01:18:46,126 --> 01:18:48,185
There's a small-time producer.

1050
01:18:49,096 --> 01:18:50,188
They want to record a song.

1051
01:18:51,065 --> 01:18:53,159
Will you sing for them? - So what?

1052
01:18:54,201 --> 01:18:56,135
Music can't be compared with money.

1053
01:19:01,075 --> 01:19:02,099
This is just good.

1054
01:19:03,177 --> 01:19:04,201
Let's do this.

1055
01:19:04,311 --> 01:19:05,278
Let's just do this.

1056
01:19:06,013 --> 01:19:10,075
You know what, you're back.

1057
01:19:10,151 --> 01:19:12,210
You're back my friend.
You're back.

1058
01:19:18,025 --> 01:19:22,155
"It's not easy to be in love."

1059
01:19:22,229 --> 01:19:27,030
"To shed tears."

1060
01:19:27,167 --> 01:19:32,003
'Lovers are always
struck with grief."

1061
01:19:32,072 --> 01:19:36,134
"Not everyone's blessed with this
boon." - Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

1062
01:19:37,177 --> 01:19:39,111
Sir, the pitch is going flat.
Please up it a little.

1063
01:19:40,114 --> 01:19:41,172
One more. - Yes.

1064
01:19:41,215 --> 01:19:42,182
Come on.

1065
01:19:46,053 --> 01:19:50,183
"It's not easy to be in love."

1066
01:19:50,291 --> 01:19:53,158
"To shed tears." - Stop!
Stop! Stop!

1067
01:19:53,294 --> 01:19:55,058
Sir, again pitch problem, sir.

1068
01:19:55,129 --> 01:19:57,154
One more. - Okay.

1069
01:19:57,264 --> 01:19:59,028
Yeah. One more.

1070
01:20:05,106 --> 01:20:08,167
“It's not easy.." - Stop.

1071
01:20:08,209 --> 01:20:12,077
Do you want me to down it a little?
- No, no need.

1072
01:20:12,179 --> 01:20:14,079
Let's try again. - Yeah.

1073
01:20:15,215 --> 01:20:18,116
My voice.. One more.

1074
01:20:18,252 --> 01:20:19,219
Come on.

1075
01:20:28,095 --> 01:20:29,119
What's wrong?

1076
01:20:32,099 --> 01:20:33,191
Think it's funny?

1077
01:20:34,201 --> 01:20:35,225
Can you sing this song?

1078
01:20:37,271 --> 01:20:40,104
Can you?
Then sing it. - Sir..

1079
01:20:40,141 --> 01:20:43,008
Sing it..
- Sorry, sir. It.. Wasn't for you..

1080
01:20:43,077 --> 01:20:45,239
The tune's so strange, and you..

1081
01:20:48,215 --> 01:20:49,273
I need a break.

1082
01:20:50,217 --> 01:20:51,184
Sorry.

1083
01:21:02,129 --> 01:21:03,255
Rahul, I won't spare them.

1084
01:21:04,164 --> 01:21:06,132
I swear they won't
know what came their way.

1085
01:21:07,067 --> 01:21:08,193
Who do they think they are?

1086
01:21:09,303 --> 01:21:11,067
Let's go inside.

1087
01:21:11,171 --> 01:21:12,229
Come on, I'll show them.

1088
01:21:12,306 --> 01:21:14,001
Come on.

1089
01:21:18,279 --> 01:21:20,077
I've lost my voice.

1090
01:21:22,183 --> 01:21:23,241
I couldn't sing.

1091
01:21:28,022 --> 01:21:29,990
My vocal chords are fried.

1092
01:21:32,259 --> 01:21:33,283
That's not true.

1093
01:21:35,162 --> 01:21:36,129
It's okay.

1094
01:21:38,032 --> 01:21:39,124
It happens.

1095
01:21:40,267 --> 01:21:42,031
<i>Let's try again. - I am finished.</i>

1096
01:21:42,102 --> 01:21:50,102
"You.. leave me.."

1097
01:21:54,281 --> 01:22:02,281
“That can never happen..

1098
01:22:05,126 --> 01:22:09,996
...beloved."

1099
01:22:14,201 --> 01:22:15,259
He's back again.

1100
01:22:19,239 --> 01:22:22,265
These stars look
so ugly after they flop.

1101
01:22:24,078 --> 01:22:30,108
"I always mention about you."

1102
01:22:34,121 --> 01:22:40,185
<i>“I'm always concerned about you."</i>

1103
01:22:44,198 --> 01:22:51,264
<i>I am what you are."</i>

1104
01:22:54,274 --> 01:23:02,273
"You're the one that
gave me my style.”

1105
01:23:04,018 --> 01:23:08,979
"Because it's you.. it's you."

1106
01:23:09,190 --> 01:23:14,219
"You're my life."

1107
01:23:14,261 --> 01:23:18,994
"My relief, my pain."

1108
01:23:19,133 --> 01:23:24,071
"You're my love."

1109
01:23:24,271 --> 01:23:29,038
“It's you.. it's you."

1110
01:23:30,010 --> 01:23:34,971
"You're my pain, you're my cure."

1111
01:23:35,115 --> 01:23:39,143
"My relief, my pain."

1112
01:23:39,253 --> 01:23:45,056
"You're my love."

1113
01:24:16,157 --> 01:24:17,249
Sorry.

1114
01:24:19,026 --> 01:24:21,120
I tried,
but I couldn't come earlier.

1115
01:24:25,099 --> 01:24:26,191
How was the recording?

1116
01:24:27,234 --> 01:24:28,998
Nothing happened?

1117
01:24:29,303 --> 01:24:32,273
So, what did you do today?
- Nothing.

1118
01:24:33,107 --> 01:24:34,074
I was listening to my songs.

1119
01:24:34,141 --> 01:24:35,199
Trying to sing.

1120
01:24:36,110 --> 01:24:37,202
You don't get them these days.

1121
01:24:38,212 --> 01:24:39,179
You will.

1122
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:42,105
I will pray for you.

1123
01:24:43,017 --> 01:24:43,279
You can do that later.

1124
01:24:44,018 --> 01:24:46,043
But first, did you eat or..

1125
01:24:46,120 --> 01:24:48,088
...were you singing
on an empty stomach?

1126
01:24:56,297 --> 01:24:58,061
I am very hungry.

1127
01:25:00,034 --> 01:25:01,160
Let's go out.

1128
01:25:01,268 --> 01:25:03,236
Let's stay here. I've ordered food.

1129
01:25:03,304 --> 01:25:04,271
It'll be here soon.

1130
01:25:05,272 --> 01:25:08,037
Aarohi,
there were few calls for you.

1131
01:25:08,275 --> 01:25:10,004
Sehgal uncle called.

1132
01:25:10,110 --> 01:25:12,078
He spoke to someone for you.

1133
01:25:13,047 --> 01:25:15,106
There was a call
from a talent show.

1134
01:25:15,215 --> 01:25:17,047
For a judging job, or something..

1135
01:25:17,118 --> 01:25:19,212
And from a magazine as well.
For an interwiew.

1136
01:25:19,253 --> 01:25:22,018
I asked him to call tomorrow.

1137
01:25:22,189 --> 01:25:24,021
Rahul. - Yes.

1138
01:25:24,258 --> 01:25:25,248
Look at me.

1139
01:25:41,108 --> 01:25:42,269
Has anything changed?

1140
01:25:52,219 --> 01:25:54,210
Nothing's changed?

1141
01:25:56,123 --> 01:25:57,090
Come here.

1142
01:26:05,232 --> 01:26:06,199
Food.

1143
01:26:10,137 --> 01:26:11,298
How much? - How much? - 1560.

1144
01:26:12,273 --> 01:26:14,037
I got it. I got it.

1145
01:26:14,241 --> 01:26:16,073
How much? - 1560.

1146
01:26:18,212 --> 01:26:20,203
1560.

1147
01:26:22,082 --> 01:26:23,072
Keep the change. Thank you.

1148
01:26:23,217 --> 01:26:25,185
<i>Can I get an autograph? - Yes.</i>

1149
01:26:27,288 --> 01:26:28,983
Not yours, madam's.

1150
01:26:37,264 --> 01:26:38,993
I'll call her.

1151
01:26:48,175 --> 01:26:50,234
Aarohi, he wants your autograph.

1152
01:26:51,145 --> 01:26:54,080
Now. I'll give it later.

1153
01:26:57,151 --> 01:26:58,983
These moments are priceless.

1154
01:27:00,187 --> 01:27:02,053
They don't come back.

1155
01:27:02,289 --> 01:27:03,256
Go.

1156
01:27:04,258 --> 01:27:05,987
I'll do it, go.

1157
01:27:31,251 --> 01:27:33,151
I'm a big fan, madam.

1158
01:27:34,188 --> 01:27:35,986
I listen to all your songs, madam.

1159
01:27:36,023 --> 01:27:37,013
All of them.

1160
01:27:39,026 --> 01:27:40,050
Name? - Anil.

1161
01:27:40,294 --> 01:27:41,261
Anil.

1162
01:27:42,229 --> 01:27:44,197
<i>I had a great desire to meet you.</i>

1163
01:27:45,232 --> 01:27:47,030
I'm really happy.

1164
01:27:50,304 --> 01:27:52,170
Thank you, madam. Thank you.

1165
01:27:56,010 --> 01:27:58,172
Due to your tax problems,
your accounts have been sealed.

1166
01:27:59,113 --> 01:28:01,138
You've only few millions left.

1167
01:28:03,117 --> 01:28:04,278
But, you can't withdraw them.

1168
01:28:05,219 --> 01:28:07,210
I've struck a deal
for your house as well.

1169
01:28:08,122 --> 01:28:12,081
It's a penthouse,
so it'll sell easily.

1170
01:28:13,260 --> 01:28:14,250
It'll take some time.

1171
01:28:16,030 --> 01:28:17,293
Sorry, sir.
But your card is not working.

1172
01:28:21,201 --> 01:28:24,102
Just like that.. - No problem.

1173
01:28:25,039 --> 01:28:25,267
Thank you sir.

1174
01:28:26,006 --> 01:28:27,064
We're not that bad.

1175
01:28:27,241 --> 01:28:35,241
“It's you."

1176
01:29:03,143 --> 01:29:05,009
It's all over.

1177
01:29:06,247 --> 01:29:07,214
Rahul.

1178
01:29:09,083 --> 01:29:10,016
It's all over.

1179
01:29:10,084 --> 01:29:11,142
What's all this?

1180
01:29:12,252 --> 01:29:14,016
Nothing to drink.

1181
01:29:16,190 --> 01:29:17,214
It's all over.

1182
01:29:20,194 --> 01:29:22,094
It's all over.
- What are you doing?

1183
01:29:25,099 --> 01:29:31,300
It's all over.

1184
01:29:32,206 --> 01:29:36,006
It's all over. - Rahul.

1185
01:29:36,076 --> 01:29:37,100
It's all over.

1186
01:29:38,179 --> 01:29:40,147
Rahul. - It's all over.

1187
01:29:42,083 --> 01:29:44,051
It's all over.
- What are you doing?

1188
01:29:44,118 --> 01:29:47,179
Rahul. - It's all over.

1189
01:29:47,221 --> 01:29:49,189
It's all over. - Rahul.

1190
01:29:49,256 --> 01:29:51,088
Rahul. - It's all over.

1191
01:29:51,125 --> 01:29:53,253
What are you doing?

1192
01:29:54,028 --> 01:29:56,087
Nothing's over yet.

1193
01:29:56,230 --> 01:29:58,028
Nothing's over yet.
- It's all over.

1194
01:29:58,165 --> 01:30:00,224
Nothing's over yet.

1195
01:30:00,267 --> 01:30:01,996
Everything's okay.

1196
01:30:02,169 --> 01:30:04,297
I'll get water.

1197
01:30:46,046 --> 01:30:47,036
Rahul, water.

1198
01:31:00,160 --> 01:31:01,127

How are you?

1201
01:31:31,192 --> 01:31:33,024
What happened to your voice?

1202
01:31:33,093 --> 01:31:34,060
It's everything okay?

1203
01:31:34,161 --> 01:31:35,287
Why are you sounding so low.

1204
01:31:38,232 --> 01:31:39,256
What happened?

1205
01:31:41,202 --> 01:31:43,000
Hey rahul!

01:31:58,252 --> 01:31:59,242
I don't know.

1212
01:32:01,155 --> 01:32:02,247
I'm just a little lost.

1213
01:32:03,023 --> 01:32:05,082
Rahul you not alone.

1214
01:32:05,159 --> 01:32:07,025

We'll come back tomorrow.

You're not alone.

01:32:16,070 --> 01:32:17,196
I am not alone, dad.

01:32:22,176 --> 01:32:23,234

Ladies and gentlemen it's pleasure
to have all of you here on stage.

01:32:37,191 --> 01:32:41,150
It's the most important
day of my life.

1222
01:32:46,133 --> 01:32:52,095
25 great years of long struggle,
pain, success, failures.

Your love and good wishes.

1224

Now without wasting any more time.

01:33:01,015 --> 01:33:04,144
<i>And now, I call upon the stage.</i>

Do you have a invitation card?

Sorry, sorry.

Don't do this.

1258
01:36:47,174 --> 01:36:48,232
Stop it.

1259
01:36:48,309 --> 01:36:50,209
You're always hovering around me.

1260
01:36:50,277 --> 01:36:52,041
<i>What am I doing? Why am I doing it?</i>

1261
01:36:52,079 --> 01:36:54,104
<i>Am I asleep? Am I awake?
- Rahu), what are you doing?</i>

1262
01:36:54,148 --> 01:36:56,116
I'm fed up of this.

1263
01:36:56,250 --> 01:36:58,116
I was better-off before. - Rahul.

1264
01:36:58,185 --> 01:37:00,051
I was happier alone.
- Listen to me.

1265
01:37:00,120 --> 01:37:02,054
I feel suffocated
since you came here.

1266
01:37:02,122 --> 01:37:04,090
What are you doing, Rahul?
- Get lost.

1267
01:37:04,158 --> 01:37:05,990
Go!
- Rahul, listen to me.

1268
01:37:06,193 --> 01:37:09,094
Just go away!

1269
01:37:16,203 --> 01:37:18,069
Rahul, open the door.

1270
01:37:21,042 --> 01:37:22,009
Please.

1271
01:37:32,019 --> 01:37:33,987
We all fall weak, Rahul.

1272
01:37:36,090 --> 01:37:37,114
We're scared.

1273
01:37:39,260 --> 01:37:40,227
I was too.

1274
01:37:43,263 --> 01:37:46,198
I thought that was my life.

1275
01:37:49,103 --> 01:37:51,003
Then, you came in my life.

1276
01:37:56,110 --> 01:37:58,044
And changed everything.

1277
01:38:01,115 --> 01:38:04,244
You cannot leave me alone
after giving me all this.

1278
01:38:11,125 --> 01:38:17,223
I love you!

1279
01:38:19,199 --> 01:38:21,167
This is what you've
been waiting for.

1280
01:38:23,270 --> 01:38:24,237
It's here.

1281
01:38:26,173 --> 01:38:29,040
I am what you wanted to make me.

1282
01:38:31,178 --> 01:38:37,174
At least,
open the door for my sake.

1283
01:38:40,120 --> 01:38:41,087
Please.

1284
01:38:54,201 --> 01:38:58,195
At least, open the door..

1285
01:39:00,140 --> 01:39:08,140
"“Empty.. your eyes.”

1286
01:39:11,218 --> 01:39:19,218
<i>"1 wish you.. could fill my eyes."</i>

1287
01:39:21,061 --> 01:39:22,028
Help me.

1288
01:39:22,196 --> 01:39:30,196
"I wish you.. could fill
my eyes." - Please help me.

1289
01:39:33,040 --> 01:39:35,008
How can they disappear?
- I don't know.

1290
01:39:35,075 --> 01:39:37,134
We've recordings lined up,
shows have been organized.

1291
01:39:37,311 --> 01:39:39,040
Who is going to do it?

1292
01:39:39,080 --> 01:39:42,015
Find out where they are. - Yes sir.

1293
01:40:05,272 --> 01:40:11,006
"My beloved,
if you give me your pain."

1294
01:40:11,144 --> 01:40:16,981
"I swear I'll get better."

1295
01:40:21,322 --> 01:40:27,284
"My beloved,
if you give me your pain."

1296
01:40:28,062 --> 01:40:33,091
"I swear I'll get better."

1297
01:40:33,200 --> 01:40:41,200
"If you give me this gift.."

1298
01:40:44,178 --> 01:40:49,241
“I'll forsake all happiness.™

1299
01:40:50,117 --> 01:40:58,117
“I'll die."

1300
01:41:01,195 --> 01:41:07,032
"My beloved,
if you give me your pain."

1301
01:41:07,068 --> 01:41:13,132
"I swear I'll get better."

1302
01:41:29,156 --> 01:41:34,253
"I want to spend the rest of
my life, leaning on your shoulder."

1303
01:41:35,029 --> 01:41:40,160
“If my dream comes true,
I'll be so fortunate."

1304
01:41:40,201 --> 01:41:46,038
“It'll be your tears, and my eyes."

1305
01:41:46,073 --> 01:41:54,073
"If you give me your grief."

1306
01:42:02,222 --> 01:42:07,285
“I'll be filled with happiness.”

1307
01:42:08,162 --> 01:42:16,162
“I'll die."

1308
01:42:19,206 --> 01:42:25,077
"My beloved,
if you give me your pain."

1309
01:42:25,112 --> 01:42:30,107
"I swear I'll get better."

1310
01:42:30,151 --> 01:42:33,121
And now,
I'd like to invite on stage..

1311
01:42:33,187 --> 01:42:37,124
...the one that's
captivated our hearts.

1312
01:42:38,259 --> 01:42:43,095
I would like to call upon,
our favorite RJ.

1313
01:42:43,130 --> 01:42:45,189
That is Rahul Jayekar.

1314
01:42:45,299 --> 01:42:47,063
Clap!

1315
01:42:47,201 --> 01:42:55,201
RJ! RJ! RJ! RJ!

1316
01:43:04,085 --> 01:43:09,216
"Whether in happiness, or grief."

1317
01:43:09,289 --> 01:43:12,190
"“The heart always
called out to you."

1318
01:43:12,226 --> 01:43:15,093
"You made me, you shaped me up."

1319
01:43:15,162 --> 01:43:20,293
"The world looks up to God,
but you're my support.”

1320
01:43:21,035 --> 01:43:24,061
<i>“All I need is you."</i>

1321
01:43:26,173 --> 01:43:29,268
"No matter what it is."

1322
01:43:32,046 --> 01:43:34,140
<i>“All I need is you."</i>

1323
01:43:34,315 --> 01:43:37,148
"No matter what it is."

1324
01:43:37,184 --> 01:43:42,179
“I'll do it for you.

1325
01:43:43,023 --> 01:43:51,023
“I'll die."

1326
01:43:54,168 --> 01:44:00,005
"My beloved,
if you give me your pain."

1327
01:44:00,073 --> 01:44:05,204
"I swear I'll get better."

1328
01:44:05,212 --> 01:44:10,241
"My beloved,
if you give me your pain."

1329
01:44:11,118 --> 01:44:17,114
"I swear I'll get better."

1330
01:44:32,206 --> 01:44:34,231
The recording studio
called yesterday.

1331
01:44:36,110 --> 01:44:37,202
You didn't go for your recording.

1332
01:44:40,214 --> 01:44:42,080
Rahul needs me, and..

1333
01:44:44,018 --> 01:44:45,144
I want to look after him.

1334
01:44:46,253 --> 01:44:49,245
If I stay busy,
who will look after him?

1335
01:44:50,023 --> 01:44:51,149
He's going nowhere.

1336
01:44:51,259 --> 01:44:54,126
You'll be at loss, because
you don't know what you have here.

1337
01:44:55,029 --> 01:44:59,159
You can lose all this in a moment.

1338
01:45:00,101 --> 01:45:02,001
I tried explaining it to him.

1339
01:45:03,237 --> 01:45:05,205
I beg you.

1340
01:45:05,272 --> 01:45:07,240
Don't test me.

1341
01:45:23,123 --> 01:45:25,023
I'm tying you down, right?

1342
01:45:29,263 --> 01:45:31,095
Don't do this, Aarohi.

1343
01:45:32,032 --> 01:45:33,261
Don't miss your schedules.

1344
01:45:50,084 --> 01:45:52,018
I'll stay here, with you.

1345
01:45:55,022 --> 01:45:56,251
Otherwise you will be alone.

1346
01:45:57,291 --> 01:45:59,191
You will do whatever you wish.

1347
01:46:01,128 --> 01:46:03,096
I cannot take this risk.

1348
01:46:05,132 --> 01:46:07,226
<i>I won't break your trust this time.
- But, Rahul..</i>

1349
01:46:07,268 --> 01:46:09,999
And you won't waste
your life for me.

1350
01:46:10,037 --> 01:46:12,267
But, Rahul I..
- Aarohi, your failure..

1351
01:46:13,007 --> 01:46:14,236
...will be the biggest
defeat of my life.

1352
01:46:20,180 --> 01:46:23,241
I cannot see you
go down the same lane.

1353
01:46:25,019 --> 01:46:26,111
You'll never be Rahul Jayekar.

1354
01:46:27,154 --> 01:46:28,212
Not even for me.

1355
01:46:30,124 --> 01:46:31,114
Promise me.

1356
01:46:40,234 --> 01:46:42,100
Best of luck. Do well.

1357
01:46:44,104 --> 01:46:45,071
I am right here.

1358
01:46:45,105 --> 01:46:46,163
It's here just for you.

1359
01:46:48,075 --> 01:46:49,270
Ma'am we raedy for you.

1360
01:46:50,211 --> 01:46:52,202
Lovely Aarohi Shirke.

1361
01:46:53,113 --> 01:46:54,171
Okay.

1362
01:47:00,221 --> 01:47:01,188
Who's he?

1363
01:47:03,157 --> 01:47:04,147
<i>Yes I will come.</i>

1364
01:47:08,062 --> 01:47:09,029
See you.

1365
01:47:16,270 --> 01:47:17,999
Rahul Jayekar.

1366
01:47:23,210 --> 01:47:26,043
What's up, buddy? - Nothing much.

1367
01:47:27,081 --> 01:47:28,105
How are you?

1368
01:47:30,017 --> 01:47:30,984
Rocking.

1369
01:47:32,186 --> 01:47:33,278
What are you doing here?

1370
01:47:35,222 --> 01:47:37,020
Watching the show.

1371
01:47:38,292 --> 01:47:40,021
Good to see you.

1372
01:47:40,127 --> 01:47:42,118
You're doing well. - Yeah.

1373
01:47:56,243 --> 01:47:57,210
Rahul!

1374
01:48:01,148 --> 01:48:02,274
Sorry. Beer?

1375
01:48:11,092 --> 01:48:12,218
No, thanks. - Sure?

1376
01:48:18,199 --> 01:48:20,031
Yeah. Quit!

1377
01:48:22,270 --> 01:48:24,034
Pass me a diet coke.

1378
01:48:28,075 --> 01:48:29,099
Diet coke, huh!

1379
01:48:32,212 --> 01:48:35,182
Cheers.

1380
01:48:43,290 --> 01:48:44,257
Mr. Rahul.

1381
01:48:46,026 --> 01:48:48,256
Kunal Basu, I'm a journalist.

1382
01:48:50,031 --> 01:48:50,998
Okay.

1383
01:48:51,065 --> 01:48:52,294
I want an interwiew.

1384
01:48:54,135 --> 01:48:55,261
Exclusive interview.

1385
01:48:57,171 --> 01:49:01,074
About your personal life,
etcetera, etcetera.

1386
01:49:01,241 --> 01:49:03,209
Sorry, but I'm no
longer famous enough..

1387
01:49:03,277 --> 01:49:05,211
...for people to read about my life.

1388
01:49:06,180 --> 01:49:07,113
They know it all.

1389
01:49:07,147 --> 01:49:08,308
Not about your love-life.

1390
01:49:10,017 --> 01:49:12,281
<i>I mean, the thing between
you and Ms. Aarohi.</i>

1391
01:49:13,087 --> 01:49:15,112
Few people know about it.

1392
01:49:16,057 --> 01:49:18,082
I don't want to talk
about me and Aarohi.

1393
01:49:20,094 --> 01:49:21,255
You don't understand.

1394
01:49:23,264 --> 01:49:28,031
Aarohi's fans want to know
when she's getting married.

1395
01:49:28,302 --> 01:49:31,101
I told you this is
my personal matter..

1396
01:49:31,138 --> 01:49:33,072
<i>...and I don't want
to talk about it.</i>

1397
01:49:33,174 --> 01:49:36,075
Your personal life's
public property as well.

1398
01:49:37,111 --> 01:49:38,169
No, it's not.

1399
01:49:39,146 --> 01:49:40,113
Thank you.

1400
01:49:45,152 --> 01:49:46,119
Mr. Rahul.

1401
01:49:47,021 --> 01:49:51,083
You don't know what
people say about you two.

1402
01:49:51,292 --> 01:49:53,090
That's nothing new.

1403
01:49:53,227 --> 01:49:58,063
People also say that,
Aarohi used to sing in beer bars.

1404
01:49:58,199 --> 01:50:02,227
And you supported her
just to have some fun.

1405
01:50:03,304 --> 01:50:05,033
You used her.

1406
01:50:07,007 --> 01:50:09,169
You made her your
concubine and left her.

1407
01:50:11,045 --> 01:50:12,979
Who do you think you are?
- What are you doing?

1408
01:50:13,013 --> 01:50:14,174
You dare hit a journalist.

1409
01:50:14,281 --> 01:50:16,113
Who do you think you are?

1410
01:50:16,116 --> 01:50:18,141
You ruined a girl's life.

1411
01:50:18,252 --> 01:50:20,220
You sleep with that girl.

1412
01:50:20,254 --> 01:50:23,224
You stay with her,
but you can't admit it.

1413
01:50:24,024 --> 01:50:26,083
I'll have you arrested. Wait.

1414
01:50:26,160 --> 01:50:27,150
You rascal.

1415
01:51:43,103 --> 01:51:47,040
9870541084.

1416
01:51:47,141 --> 01:51:49,041
Yes, that's my number.

1417
01:51:49,176 --> 01:51:50,200
Save it. Okay.

1418
01:51:56,316 --> 01:51:59,217
We're here for him.

1419
01:52:00,054 --> 01:52:01,021
Him.

1420
01:52:02,156 --> 01:52:03,146
Not possible.

1421
01:52:04,158 --> 01:52:05,148
What a man.

1422
01:52:07,127 --> 01:52:09,095
He was drunk.
He created quite a scene.

1423
01:52:09,163 --> 01:52:10,255
He beat-up a journalist.

1424
01:52:12,099 --> 01:52:14,067
Then, he beat-up a taxi-driver.

1425
01:52:15,135 --> 01:52:17,069
He smashed someone's car.

1426
01:52:18,138 --> 01:52:19,196
That's not done.

1427
01:52:20,207 --> 01:52:23,006
And what's the time now.

1428
01:52:24,078 --> 01:52:25,204
You won't get bail now.

1429
01:52:30,150 --> 01:52:33,176
I'll call Kamte.

1430
01:52:35,022 --> 01:52:37,218
The court will open
at 11 am tomorrow.

1431
01:52:37,291 --> 01:52:39,157
He'll be present
in the court first..

1432
01:52:39,193 --> 01:52:41,992
...only then he can get bail.
He has to stay here tonight.

1433
01:52:42,062 --> 01:52:43,029
Brother.

1434
01:52:45,032 --> 01:52:48,297
<i>Can I have a minute? - Sit.</i>

1435
01:52:51,272 --> 01:52:54,105
I.. - 1 know..

1436
01:52:55,242 --> 01:52:58,041
You're Aarohi Shirke, right.

1437
01:53:01,015 --> 01:53:01,982
Yes.

1438
01:53:03,083 --> 01:53:04,107
Who's he?

1439
01:53:04,218 --> 01:53:05,185
<i>...</i>

1440
01:53:08,021 --> 01:53:09,045
We're friends.

1441
01:53:10,124 --> 01:53:12,058
We had a fight.

1442
01:53:12,292 --> 01:53:15,023
I threatened to leave him.

1443
01:53:15,062 --> 01:53:16,996
That got him worried and..

1444
01:53:22,269 --> 01:53:23,259
Love story.

1445
01:53:25,172 --> 01:53:26,139
Right?

1446
01:53:30,277 --> 01:53:35,010
Please, you can keep this..

1447
01:53:35,149 --> 01:53:37,117
What's this?
- And let him go. - No.

1448
01:53:37,184 --> 01:53:40,279
And let him go. - What's this? No.

1449
01:53:41,021 --> 01:53:46,084
It won't happen again.
I promise you, and..

1450
01:53:49,230 --> 01:53:57,230
“It's you."

1451
01:54:39,213 --> 01:54:41,181
We'll go far away.

1452
01:54:44,117 --> 01:54:46,085
Where no one knows us.

1453
01:54:47,187 --> 01:54:54,093
I'll finish the contracts
that I signed, and leave.

1454
01:54:55,295 --> 01:54:58,265
Without Rahul,
ll don't want anything.

1455
01:55:00,067 --> 01:55:04,004
I wanted to be successful..

1456
01:55:04,038 --> 01:55:08,168
...but not at this price.

1457
01:55:10,210 --> 01:55:12,076
Not by losing him.

1458
01:55:15,249 --> 01:55:17,274
You don't fall sick
along with the patient.

1459
01:55:20,054 --> 01:55:21,021
Dear.

1460
01:55:22,256 --> 01:55:24,224
If your love was his cure..

1461
01:55:26,160 --> 01:55:29,027
...then why didn't it work yet?

1462
01:55:32,032 --> 01:55:34,023
He's dependent on his habits.

1463
01:55:35,002 --> 01:55:35,969
His flaws.

1464
01:55:38,005 --> 01:55:40,133
He doesn't want to get anywhere.

1465
01:55:41,142 --> 01:55:44,134
So, where will you take him?

1466
01:55:45,079 --> 01:55:46,046
Not me.

1467
01:55:49,116 --> 01:55:53,110
He'll take me, in his world.

1468
01:55:54,221 --> 01:55:56,121
The place where he
stays day and night.

1469
01:55:56,290 --> 01:55:58,054
And he's happy.

1470
01:55:59,059 --> 01:56:01,187
His habits will be mine.

1471
01:56:02,263 --> 01:56:04,129
His flaws will be mine.

1472
01:56:05,032 --> 01:56:06,261
He cannot leave them, but..

1473
01:56:08,236 --> 01:56:10,102
I can take them up.

1474
01:56:12,039 --> 01:56:17,000
If this poison is his first love,
then I'll accept it too.

1475
01:56:19,046 --> 01:56:22,072
I'll stagger along with him.

1476
01:56:29,289 --> 01:56:33,248
<i>Then, I might find
him at some point.</i>

1477
01:56:35,262 --> 01:56:37,253
He might get fed up of his habits.

1478
01:56:38,099 --> 01:56:42,263
He might come back and say “Aarohi,
I am tired...

1479
01:56:45,239 --> 01:56:48,174
Then I'll say "Come..

1480
01:56:50,144 --> 01:56:51,236
...let's go home."

1481
01:56:53,280 --> 01:56:54,270
And, he'll come back.

1482
01:56:56,183 --> 01:56:57,275
We'll come back, uncle.

1483
01:57:02,156 --> 01:57:05,990
You've gone crazy.

1484
01:57:07,027 --> 01:57:09,223
You don't know what you're saying.

1485
01:58:20,067 --> 01:58:21,193
When did you get up?

1486
01:58:25,139 --> 01:58:26,265
You kept crying all night.

1487
01:58:31,045 --> 01:58:32,206
My love's made you sad.

1488
01:58:36,183 --> 01:58:41,144
I was crying,
because I was missing you.

1489
01:58:41,288 --> 01:58:42,278
I am right here.

1490
01:58:47,161 --> 01:58:48,185
Just like that.

1491
01:58:55,069 --> 01:58:56,059
Come closer.

1492
01:59:04,178 --> 01:59:06,078
I came here to tell you.

1493
01:59:09,049 --> 01:59:10,210
You can cry all you want.

1494
01:59:12,253 --> 01:59:14,187
Your days of crying are over.

1495
01:59:15,022 --> 01:59:16,990
I'll leave everything, Aarohi.

1496
01:59:18,058 --> 01:59:19,992
I'll turn over a new leaf for you.

1497
01:59:20,160 --> 01:59:22,026
Everything will be fine.

1498
01:59:22,129 --> 01:59:23,119
You and me.

1499
01:59:25,066 --> 01:59:26,192
You'll help me, won't you?

1500
01:59:32,139 --> 01:59:34,233
<i>Have I ever said no? - No.</i>

1501
01:59:39,013 --> 01:59:41,072
The day I saw you first,
I realized..

1502
01:59:42,249 --> 01:59:45,048
...why you came in my life.

1503
01:59:46,086 --> 01:59:47,247
You've loved me a lot.

1504
01:59:48,122 --> 01:59:50,022
Given me a lot of things.

1505
01:59:50,090 --> 01:59:53,025
I gave you what was easy for me.

1506
01:59:54,028 --> 01:59:57,259
You endured my difficulties,
my betrayal.

1507
01:59:58,265 --> 02:00:00,256
Divided love.

1508
02:00:03,203 --> 02:00:05,171
<i>And I couldn't give
you your right place.</i>

1509
02:00:07,208 --> 02:00:09,040
But all that's going to change now.

1510
02:00:09,143 --> 02:00:11,043
Right now. From this moment.

1511
02:00:11,212 --> 02:00:13,271
<i>Because Aarohi,
1 am going to join a gym.</i>

1512
02:00:15,115 --> 02:00:17,083
That's going to
be my daily program.

1513
02:00:17,218 --> 02:00:19,983
Gym in the morning,
jogging in the evening.

1514
02:00:20,121 --> 02:00:21,987
Proper diet. Aarohi.

1515
02:00:22,122 --> 02:00:23,089
Really?

1516
02:00:23,191 --> 02:00:25,159
Will you really.. - Yes.

1517
02:00:26,260 --> 02:00:28,024
<i>This time I am serious, Aarohi.</i>

1518
02:00:28,062 --> 02:00:29,120
<i>Like I never was.</i>

1519
02:00:31,232 --> 02:00:32,222
I am going.

1520
02:00:33,167 --> 02:00:35,158
Keep the food ready,
and wait for me.

1521
02:00:35,235 --> 02:00:36,202
Miss me.

1522
02:00:37,171 --> 02:00:38,138
Rahul.

1523
02:00:50,051 --> 02:00:52,145
I love you.

1524
02:00:55,089 --> 02:00:56,250
Come on.

1525
02:00:59,193 --> 02:01:00,285
I'll change all this.

1526
02:01:11,071 --> 02:01:12,038
Aarohi.

1527
02:01:13,040 --> 02:01:14,007
What?

1528
02:01:16,110 --> 02:01:17,077
Nothing.

1529
02:01:20,114 --> 02:01:21,172
Just like that.

1530
02:01:22,083 --> 02:01:29,080
"Forget me.
This is my final goodbye."

1531
02:01:29,156 --> 02:01:35,095
"You've to live on.. without me.

1532
02:01:36,197 --> 02:01:43,160
"“This is your journey, your path."

1533
02:01:44,038 --> 02:01:49,272
"You've to live on.. without me.

1534
02:01:51,011 --> 02:01:58,008
I pray you attain fame."

1535
02:01:58,118 --> 02:02:05,047
'l pray you're blessed
with all the grace.”

1536
02:02:05,259 --> 02:02:12,029
"You've to live on.. without me.

1537
02:02:13,033 --> 02:02:19,268
"Forget me.
This is my final goodbye."

1538
02:02:20,107 --> 02:02:26,137
"You've to live on.. without me.

1539
02:02:28,182 --> 02:02:32,016
"You're my shore, my support.”

1540
02:02:32,053 --> 02:02:35,148
"You're the tune in my heart,
my saga."

1541
02:02:35,255 --> 02:02:41,194
"Be your own God."

1542
02:02:44,031 --> 02:02:47,057
"I am like evening that's fading."

1543
02:02:47,201 --> 02:02:50,262
"You're the new dawn."

1544
02:02:51,105 --> 02:02:59,105
"You've to live on.. without me.

1545
02:03:26,073 --> 02:03:28,201
Sir, one body found in water.

1546
02:03:29,176 --> 02:03:32,043
And Ambulance will
come for take the body.

1547
02:03:54,202 --> 02:03:56,102
Aarohi dear listen. - Aarohi.

1548
02:03:56,170 --> 02:03:58,070
Aarohi where are you going?

1549
02:03:58,138 --> 02:04:01,005
Aarohi dear listen. - Aarohi.

1550
02:04:01,042 --> 02:04:04,103
Aarohi don't ...

1551
02:04:04,178 --> 02:04:06,112
Aarohi - where are you going.

1552
02:04:37,011 --> 02:04:45,011
Coward!

1553
02:04:56,263 --> 02:04:59,255
Coward! Coward! Coward!

1554
02:05:00,234 --> 02:05:03,033
Coward!

1555
02:05:07,108 --> 02:05:15,108
“It's you."

1556
02:05:38,172 --> 02:05:39,230
Where are you going?

1557
02:05:43,310 --> 02:05:44,277
Anywhere?

1558
02:05:48,182 --> 02:05:49,115
What do you mean?

1559
02:05:49,183 --> 02:05:50,241
I mean far away.

1560
02:05:53,053 --> 02:05:54,145
I'm leaving everything.

1561
02:05:55,056 --> 02:05:56,182
But, that's not what Rahul wanted?

1562
02:05:58,091 --> 02:05:59,183
Rahul who?

1563
02:06:00,094 --> 02:06:02,153
I don't know any
person by that name.

1564
02:06:03,030 --> 02:06:07,058
Aarohi, decisions taken in a rage,
always hurt in the end.

1565
02:06:08,302 --> 02:06:13,001
For the first time,
my decision hasn't hurt me.

1566
02:06:13,240 --> 02:06:14,207
Good.

1567
02:06:15,242 --> 02:06:16,209
Very good.

1568
02:06:18,012 --> 02:06:18,979
Please go.

1569
02:06:20,181 --> 02:06:22,013
He should fade away.

1570
02:06:22,249 --> 02:06:24,115
Die inside you.

1571
02:06:25,252 --> 02:06:27,050
He was worth that.

1572
02:06:32,059 --> 02:06:33,993
I tried stopping him.

1573
02:06:35,029 --> 02:06:36,155
But he didn't stop.

1574
02:06:38,032 --> 02:06:38,999
He said..

1575
02:06:40,167 --> 02:06:42,261
"This is it".

1576
02:06:44,238 --> 02:06:48,141
He sold your art,
like your secretary.

1577
02:06:50,010 --> 02:06:53,071
The little life that he had,
was just for you.

1578
02:06:54,181 --> 02:06:57,048
But my friend died,
the day he hurt you.

1579
02:06:59,219 --> 02:07:01,119
The day he raised his hand on you.

1580
02:07:02,222 --> 02:07:04,122
The day he saw you
at the police station.

1581
02:07:05,192 --> 02:07:06,159
He knew.

1582
02:07:08,195 --> 02:07:10,254
Drinking was his weakness.

1583
02:07:12,032 --> 02:07:13,261
He had become your weakness.

1584
02:07:14,301 --> 02:07:17,066
The biggest obstruction
in your path.

1585
02:07:20,207 --> 02:07:22,073
And so, he gave his life.

1586
02:07:23,210 --> 02:07:25,008
So that you can live.

1587
02:07:25,279 --> 02:07:28,010
So that,
you don't become another Jayekar.

1588
02:07:28,182 --> 02:07:31,015
But you know what, he failed.

1589
02:07:31,218 --> 02:07:32,276
My friend lost.

1590
02:07:34,121 --> 02:07:36,249
You turned out to
be another Rahul Jayekar.

1591
02:08:17,198 --> 02:08:23,035
"The place where
buds will blossom."

1592
02:08:24,271 --> 02:08:30,210
“That's where you'll find me."

1593
02:08:32,046 --> 02:08:37,246
"“The place that'll
remind you of my loyalty."

1594
02:08:39,153 --> 02:08:45,115
“That's where you'll find me."

1595
02:08:46,227 --> 02:08:53,190
“I'll come see you, I promise you."

1596
02:08:54,001 --> 02:09:01,032
"I'll always be with you,
I promise you."

1597
02:09:01,175 --> 02:09:07,205
"You've to live on.. without me.

1598
02:09:08,049 --> 02:09:10,108
Aarohi ma'am, I'm a big fan.

1599
02:09:10,151 --> 02:09:12,017
<i>Can I have your autograph, please?</i>

1600
02:09:26,233 --> 02:09:27,132
Thank you.

1601
02:09:27,168 --> 02:09:29,102
Thank you, ma'am.
- Thank you so much.

1602
02:09:30,004 --> 02:09:33,065
Wow! but Aarohi rahul Jayekar.

1603
02:09:33,107 --> 02:09:35,235
Yeah rahul Jayekar that singer.

1604
02:09:53,127 --> 02:09:58,031
"Because it's you.. it's you."

1605
02:09:58,232 --> 02:10:03,227
"You're my life."

1606
02:10:04,038 --> 02:10:08,134
"My relief, my pain."

1607
02:10:08,209 --> 02:10:14,012
"You're my love."

1608
02:10:24,125 --> 02:10:29,120
<i>"You and I share a strange bond."</i>

1609
02:10:29,196 --> 02:10:34,100
