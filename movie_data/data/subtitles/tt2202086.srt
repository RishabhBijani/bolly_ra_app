1
00:01:38,781 --> 00:01:43,989
When a person is faced with a question
as to what the consequences would be..

2
00:01:47,844 --> 00:01:49,594
..he hesitates.

3
00:01:52,844 --> 00:01:56,011
Such a person..

4
00:01:56,052 --> 00:01:59,546
..has no right to be in the force.

5
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:04,310
The Force is nobody's personal fiefdom.

6
00:02:04,351 --> 00:02:09,438
(Background Music)

7
00:02:10,161 --> 00:02:13,870
The Force has..

8
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:17,094
..its own dignity.

9
00:02:18,386 --> 00:02:22,886
It's our responsibility
to uphold the dignity.

10
00:02:22,927 --> 00:02:28,391
(Background Music)

11
00:02:30,188 --> 00:02:33,105
You might think that it is wrong.

12
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:39,781
Because what you perceive
is your reality.

13
00:02:41,552 --> 00:02:43,927
What I perceive is my reality.

14
00:02:43,968 --> 00:02:46,511
There is no reality as such.

15
00:02:46,552 --> 00:02:49,552
There are only perceptions.

16
00:02:49,593 --> 00:02:53,926
We respected Gandhiji..

17
00:02:58,175 --> 00:03:01,687
..for as long as we could.

18
00:03:01,839 --> 00:03:06,297
I did what I felt was right.

19
00:03:07,331 --> 00:03:09,039
It was not perception.

20
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,809
Not my perception, but clarity.

21
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:17,695
(Background Music)

22
00:03:35,344 --> 00:03:40,510
Mr. Anna, I have a solution
in mind for this problem.

23
00:03:41,552 --> 00:03:45,344
But your ideals..

24
00:03:46,366 --> 00:03:50,386
..and your principles would
prevent me from doing it.

25
00:03:50,434 --> 00:03:53,643
I don't undertake a task..

26
00:03:54,261 --> 00:03:56,011
..which I cannot accomplish.

27
00:03:56,137 --> 00:03:58,720
We know it's a serious problem.

28
00:03:58,815 --> 00:04:02,023
I am accountable to the people
more than the party.

29
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:10,007
I know gangsters mistake my
Gandhian values to be my weakness.

30
00:04:10,886 --> 00:04:13,302
Those values cannot deal with them.

31
00:04:13,343 --> 00:04:15,890
We have to give them a fitting reply.

32
00:04:16,578 --> 00:04:19,153
Everyone including me concur with it.

33
00:04:20,511 --> 00:04:24,177
You find a solution to this problem.

34
00:04:25,927 --> 00:04:30,719
All of you have firsthand knowledge..

35
00:04:30,817 --> 00:04:35,609
..and understanding about
this city and its crimes.

36
00:04:36,136 --> 00:04:39,552
Especially you, Mr. Pradhan.

37
00:04:39,911 --> 00:04:45,937
When you were the police commissioner,
crime was under control.

38
00:04:47,046 --> 00:04:52,511
So you can use your experience
and explain to us..

39
00:04:52,552 --> 00:04:55,469
..what kind of problem we are facing.

40
00:04:56,153 --> 00:04:57,203
Mr. Jagirdar..

41
00:04:58,672 --> 00:05:01,630
..we always forget that
the people in the Force..

42
00:05:01,687 --> 00:05:04,645
..are more important
than the Force itself.

43
00:05:04,801 --> 00:05:06,010
And our system..

44
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:11,515
..ignores people who are made
for this job..

45
00:05:11,848 --> 00:05:16,390
..and gives responsibility to people
who don't know what it means.

46
00:05:18,038 --> 00:05:24,329
In order to handle this situation,
we need a capable, intelligent..

47
00:05:25,772 --> 00:05:30,063
..confident and non-corrupt person.

48
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,824
- Who do you have in mind?
- Sadhu Agashe.

49
00:05:32,973 --> 00:05:35,682
He has the capability,
but look what he's doing currently.

50
00:05:35,723 --> 00:05:39,098
He is idling at his native place..

51
00:05:39,941 --> 00:05:41,608
..due to the legal cases
filed by the system.

52
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:44,890
If you ask me, there's no better person..

53
00:05:45,918 --> 00:05:48,335
..than Sadhu to handle this situation.

54
00:05:48,403 --> 00:05:50,945
Sir, you forget..

55
00:05:51,027 --> 00:05:54,069
..that Sadhu was in jail for
1.5 years before getting bail.

56
00:05:54,176 --> 00:05:55,843
Case are pending against him.

57
00:05:55,973 --> 00:05:58,098
Bhandare, there are cases
against you too.

58
00:05:59,524 --> 00:06:04,858
If Mr. Pradhan says Sadhu is the right
person to handle this situation..

59
00:06:06,015 --> 00:06:09,848
..then he definitely is.
We'll get him back.

60
00:06:10,649 --> 00:06:12,233
- Keshav!
- Yes, sir.

61
00:06:12,324 --> 00:06:14,449
Call Sadhu immediately.

62
00:06:14,931 --> 00:06:16,726
- Go and meet him.
- Yes, sir.

63
00:06:16,797 --> 00:06:20,711
(Background Music)

64
00:06:42,931 --> 00:06:44,762
Where does Sadhu Agashe live?

65
00:06:47,797 --> 00:06:49,331
(Car Door Closing)

66
00:06:51,488 --> 00:06:54,321
Mr. Sadhu! Mr. Sadhu!

67
00:06:54,598 --> 00:06:56,390
Mr. Sadhu!

68
00:06:56,431 --> 00:07:00,671
(Background Music)

69
00:07:17,742 --> 00:07:20,138
(Birds Chirping)

70
00:07:20,179 --> 00:07:22,304
Sir, Keshav here.

71
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,622
Yes. Over to Sadhu.

72
00:07:26,798 --> 00:07:28,465
Home Minister Janardhan Jagirdar.

73
00:07:32,484 --> 00:07:35,083
(Birds Chirping)

74
00:07:35,124 --> 00:07:38,290
- Hello, sir.
- Hello, Sadhu. This is Jagirdar.

75
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,948
I have good news for you.

76
00:07:40,298 --> 00:07:44,798
I will take care of
all the cases against you.

77
00:07:44,898 --> 00:07:46,273
You have to do me a favor.

78
00:07:46,314 --> 00:07:51,022
I want to revive the
defunct encounter squad.

79
00:07:51,414 --> 00:07:54,485
I want you to lead the squad.

80
00:07:54,664 --> 00:07:56,872
Let the cases against me continue.

81
00:07:57,806 --> 00:08:00,390
If I have made a mistake,
I should be punished.

82
00:08:02,294 --> 00:08:05,669
If I am right, I'll be acquitted.

83
00:08:07,484 --> 00:08:09,278
You don't have to do me this favor.

84
00:08:10,707 --> 00:08:12,828
Who told you I would come back?

85
00:08:13,933 --> 00:08:15,850
- Listen, Sadhu..
- Thank you, sir.

86
00:08:20,343 --> 00:08:22,210
How can you talk to
Mr. Jagirdar like that?

87
00:08:22,937 --> 00:08:25,312
- Don't you know who he is?
- Do you?

88
00:08:25,775 --> 00:08:29,025
Of course. He's the Home Minister.

89
00:08:32,741 --> 00:08:33,839
So why do you ask me?

90
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:38,500
(Background Music)

91
00:08:55,977 --> 00:08:57,555

92
00:08:57,596 --> 00:08:59,836
(Car Engine Starting)

93
00:09:04,453 --> 00:09:08,070
(Background Music)
(Birds Chirping)

94
00:09:18,915 --> 00:09:20,082
Who was that, dad?

95
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:24,275
They lost their way.
They asked for an address.

96
00:09:25,087 --> 00:09:27,870
Do you serve coconut water
to those who have lost their way?

97
00:09:30,054 --> 00:09:31,136
(Chair Moving)

98
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,734
I have created a new tune.

99
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:38,067
(Piano Playing)

100
00:09:38,109 --> 00:09:39,234
How is it?

101
00:09:44,931 --> 00:09:46,056
Nice.

102
00:09:47,442 --> 00:09:48,692
What are the lyrics.

103
00:09:49,026 --> 00:09:50,734
Haven't thought about that.

104
00:09:50,775 --> 00:09:52,650
The tune before the lyrics?

105
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:54,891
Lyrics always comes first.

106
00:09:54,984 --> 00:09:57,442
Dad, tell me the poem mom had written.

107
00:09:57,484 --> 00:10:01,025
'Just six of us in the house.
Four walls, roof, and I.'

108
00:10:03,361 --> 00:10:06,695
"Dark night is a friend.
Bright day is an associate."

109
00:10:06,817 --> 00:10:08,650
'Just six of us in the house.'

110
00:10:08,734 --> 00:10:11,859
'Four walls, roof, and I.'

111
00:10:12,192 --> 00:10:14,525
She wrote it to instigate me.

112
00:10:15,067 --> 00:10:17,817
I would be at work all the time.
She would be alone in the house.

113
00:10:18,234 --> 00:10:21,234
She spent loneliness really wonderfully.

114
00:10:21,864 --> 00:10:24,406
Like your mom, you too are a good writer.

115
00:10:25,007 --> 00:10:27,463
But lyrics come first, then the tune.

116
00:10:36,192 --> 00:10:38,650
Dad, recite the poem again.

117
00:10:39,235 --> 00:10:43,318
'Just six of us in the house.
Four walls, roof, and I.'

118
00:10:43,359 --> 00:10:47,483
"Dark night is a friend.
Bright day is an associate."

119
00:10:47,525 --> 00:10:50,317
'Just six of us in the house.'

120
00:10:52,483 --> 00:10:56,109
'Alone, I follow my
shadow wherever it goes.'

121
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:59,567
'I feel like a bird
on this blue canvas called sky.'

122
00:11:01,506 --> 00:11:06,173
'Like a dew drop on
a rainbow branch.'

123
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:07,994
(Gunshots)

124
00:11:16,522 --> 00:11:19,148
'Just six of us in the house.'
- Wonderful!

125
00:11:20,282 --> 00:11:23,058
'Four walls, roof, and I.'

126
00:11:29,116 --> 00:11:33,450
Sadhu is bound to react that way
after what our system has done to him.

127
00:11:33,624 --> 00:11:37,957
I don't know why we need Sadhu so badly.

128
00:11:38,207 --> 00:11:41,291
We have to beg him to come back.

129
00:11:43,129 --> 00:11:47,265
We have a fearless and aggressive
officer like Suryakant Thorat.

130
00:11:48,785 --> 00:11:50,494
We will never need Sadhu.

131
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,848
I know Thorat very well.

132
00:11:53,402 --> 00:11:55,361
He is too aggressive.

133
00:11:55,973 --> 00:11:58,348
He shoots first and contemplates later.

134
00:11:58,682 --> 00:12:02,223
Suryakant doesn't have
the intelligence, confidence..

135
00:12:02,973 --> 00:12:04,515
..and experience that Sadhu does.

136
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:08,223
Sadhu is not a relative.
I am not promoting him.

137
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,835
There is no alternative to Sadhu.

138
00:12:10,876 --> 00:12:14,460
Are you trying to say the police
department can't do without Sadhu?

139
00:12:14,932 --> 00:12:18,848
Bhandare, things are happening in Mumbai
Despite of you being the commissioner.

140
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:23,328
You are unable to handle the situation.
That's why we need Sadhu.

141
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,417
Don't get into ego problems.

142
00:12:25,489 --> 00:12:27,970
(Background Music)

143
00:12:28,011 --> 00:12:30,720
We have Mr. Pradhan's
experience to guide us.

144
00:12:32,011 --> 00:12:34,011
Don't ask him stupid questions.

145
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:38,452
Mr. Pradhan, you are right.

146
00:12:38,932 --> 00:12:45,265
The way I approached Sadhu was wrong.

147
00:12:46,277 --> 00:12:49,736
Sir, let me speak to Sadhu personally.

148
00:12:50,491 --> 00:12:51,725
He won't refuse me.

149
00:12:51,766 --> 00:12:52,388
Okay.

150
00:12:53,053 --> 00:12:53,674
Okay.

151
00:12:56,445 --> 00:12:57,403
Great!

152
00:12:57,444 --> 00:12:59,544
(Birds Chirping)

153
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:00,737
Throw it back.

154
00:13:02,283 --> 00:13:03,616
Again.

155
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:05,564
(Vehicle Stopping)

156
00:13:07,617 --> 00:13:09,450
Sadhu, you are playing marbles?

157
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:10,689
Uncle Pradhan?

158
00:13:12,387 --> 00:13:13,512
Uncle.

159
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:16,321
How are you?
You seem to have forgotten me.

160
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:17,850
Uncle, don't fool around.
Come along.

161
00:13:19,101 --> 00:13:21,265
Sure. Let me first meet your dad.

162
00:13:26,863 --> 00:13:29,655
What are you doing here
while Mumbai is burning?

163
00:13:30,316 --> 00:13:33,126
- What brings you here?
- I missed you.

164
00:13:36,653 --> 00:13:37,895
We'll play later.

165
00:13:38,061 --> 00:13:41,319
- Those are mine.
- Mine.

166
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,270
What are you doing?
Hurry up! Come on!

167
00:13:43,311 --> 00:13:45,196
(Background Music)

168
00:13:51,112 --> 00:13:52,566
These are fresh.
I just caught them.

169
00:13:55,069 --> 00:13:57,194
Who taught you to cook?

170
00:13:58,268 --> 00:14:01,184
His mom and circumstances.

171
00:14:01,737 --> 00:14:02,892
Viswon.

172
00:14:03,658 --> 00:14:06,077
It's called 'Surmai' in Mumbai.

173
00:14:08,736 --> 00:14:10,777
- It's delicious.
- Really? Have some more.

174
00:14:12,528 --> 00:14:14,209
I'll have to visit you often, Sadhu.

175
00:14:15,151 --> 00:14:16,125
Don't go back.

176
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:20,278

It's so windy.

181
00:14:39,711 --> 00:14:41,493
Your back should be
towards the wind direction.

182
00:14:42,155 --> 00:14:43,821
- Else it falls on you.
- Quiet.

183
00:14:43,862 --> 00:14:45,870
- Good.
- Quiet! Give me some water.

184
00:14:45,977 --> 00:14:46,669
(Laughing)

185
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:48,502
You are still childish.

186
00:14:52,344 --> 00:14:54,516
(Sighs)

187
00:14:56,752 --> 00:14:58,252
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

(Forest Ambience)

189
00:15:03,624 --> 00:15:04,635
Watching it?

190
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:06,020
Yes watching. It's good.

191
00:15:06,356 --> 00:15:07,815
His big brother has come.

192
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,778
Circumstances have changed, Sadhu.

193
00:15:16,033 --> 00:15:17,761
Be careful.

194
00:15:19,564 --> 00:15:21,855
New people have joined the system.

195
00:15:22,048 --> 00:15:24,948
(Background Music)

196
00:15:24,989 --> 00:15:27,156
The system itself is changing gradually.

197
00:15:29,707 --> 00:15:31,582
For better and for..

198
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:38,207
Mr. Anna and Jagirdar.
(Birds Chirping)

199
00:15:39,585 --> 00:15:41,877
They honestly want to
do something about it.

200
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:45,153
You may know about it.

201
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:49,850
Some people were unjust to you.

202
00:15:51,403 --> 00:15:55,570
It might not be right to vent
your anger on these people.

203
00:15:59,964 --> 00:16:01,422
Listen, Sadhu.

204
00:16:03,445 --> 00:16:06,779
Every person has a purpose in life.

205
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:09,450
He should pursue it. You are a cop.

206
00:16:10,567 --> 00:16:15,067
You only say that once
a cop, always a cop.

207
00:16:17,987 --> 00:16:19,790
I respect you a lot.

208
00:16:20,656 --> 00:16:23,239
You said some things to convince me.

209
00:16:24,903 --> 00:16:26,403
You are right.

210
00:16:26,737 --> 00:16:28,759
But I won't join the Force again.

211
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:35,486
You tried to convince me,
but I'm convinced by myself.

212
00:16:36,445 --> 00:16:39,112
Now it's just me and my life.

213
00:16:40,612 --> 00:16:42,862
I don't want to think about Force.

214
00:16:44,112 --> 00:16:45,737
No. Not at all.

215
00:16:46,112 --> 00:16:48,932
Me, my son..

216
00:16:50,486 --> 00:16:52,653
..and these people. That's all.

217
00:16:54,112 --> 00:16:56,612
I don't want to know
what's happening around us.

218
00:16:58,528 --> 00:17:00,778
Don't ask why. I'm sorry.

219
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:07,674
You took so much trouble to come see me.

220
00:17:09,632 --> 00:17:11,049
Genuinely, I'm sorry.

(Crows Cawing)
(Car Engine Starting)

224
00:17:41,187 --> 00:17:43,270
- Give it another thought.
- I already have.

225
00:17:44,195 --> 00:17:45,279
- Okay.
- Thank you.

226
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,487
Thank you.

227
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:48,320
Bye.

228
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,528
Dad, why did you refuse Uncle Pradhan?

229

(Background Music)

230
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:17,551
You hold yourself responsible
for mom's death.

231
00:18:20,862 --> 00:18:24,506
You haven't overcome that guilt.
You fear..

232
00:18:25,374 --> 00:18:27,486
..that something
might happen to me too.

233
00:18:29,284 --> 00:18:33,325
That's why you left the city
to live in this village.

234
00:18:33,444 --> 00:18:34,625
(Crow Cawing)

235
00:18:34,867 --> 00:18:35,937
It's been years.

236
00:18:37,332 --> 00:18:38,832
I have noticed many times..

237
00:18:39,765 --> 00:18:42,651
..you become silent
after reading the newspaper.

238
00:18:45,135 --> 00:18:48,551
You don't speak to me for days.

239
00:18:49,831 --> 00:18:51,363
You endure the pain..

240
00:18:52,692 --> 00:18:53,889
..upon reading those tragic news.

241
00:18:56,082 --> 00:18:57,605
I can see that you are in pain.

242
00:18:58,788 --> 00:19:00,206
But I can't do anything about it.

243
00:19:02,697 --> 00:19:04,571
I feel guilty.

244
00:19:06,028 --> 00:19:09,486
Two people feel guilty
in the house, not one.

245
00:19:10,179 --> 00:19:13,009
(Water Splashing)

246
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:14,570
You peel coconuts.

247
00:19:15,945 --> 00:19:18,153
You play marbles with kids.

248
00:19:18,903 --> 00:19:20,486
Sometimes you clean the settlement.

249
00:19:20,528 --> 00:19:22,889
You sit in a boat mid-river for hours.

250
00:19:23,382 --> 00:19:24,737
For fishing.

251
00:19:25,491 --> 00:19:27,424
It doesn't look nice
watching from the shore.

252
00:19:28,429 --> 00:19:31,023
Dad, I don't want to be the reason
why you refused that job.

253
00:19:32,536 --> 00:19:34,098
My dad is a cop.

257
00:19:40,823 --> 00:19:41,896
You have grown up.

(Background Music Continues)

259
00:19:49,389 --> 00:19:51,802
You mistook me the other day.

260
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,736
I'm sorry. I respect Mr. Anna
and he respects you.

261
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,239
I see no difference
between the two of you.

262
00:19:58,817 --> 00:20:01,995
I will try my best to control
the situation in the city.

- I trust you, Sadhu.
- I'm honored, sir.

- Hail India.
- I am Jagdale.

00:20:42,012 --> 00:20:44,179
I am trying, sir.
I'll surely do it.

275

Sir, Ghorpade.

Hi.

- Sir, my wife.

Your wife? Answer it.

00:20:52,179 --> 00:20:55,137
You never know when
you'll be able to talk to her again.

280

Hello, sir.

00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:58,154
Suryakant Thorat.

282
00:20:58,195 --> 00:21:00,237
- Sir!
- Have heard a lot about you.

283
00:21:01,696 --> 00:21:03,071
I hope it is positive.

284
00:21:03,112 --> 00:21:04,534
Positive as well.

285
00:21:04,816 --> 00:21:07,066
- Ghorpade, order tea for everyone.
- Yes, sir.

286
00:21:07,154 --> 00:21:10,654
- Where's the washroom?
- Sir, the last door to the right.

287
00:21:10,695 --> 00:21:12,653
- Show it to me.
- Come on, sir.

288
00:21:14,077 --> 00:21:15,494
Had heard a lot about Mr. Sadhu.

289
00:21:15,676 --> 00:21:17,885
I'm glad we will get a chance
to work with him.

290
00:21:17,999 --> 00:21:21,005
Not with him,
But we have to work under him.

293
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:28,874
Why this oldie is sitting on my head now?

294
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:32,515
If he wouldn't be there,
then I would have sat inside.

295
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,273
What's this? Is this some
family room in an Irani hotel?

296
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:46,445
- Put a latch here.
- Sir!

297
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:48,452
I should be able to see
what's going on outside.

Suryakant, come in.

00:21:53,658 --> 00:21:58,449
The job we've been given
is nobody's father's business.

301
00:21:59,049 --> 00:22:00,343
It's a government job.

302
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:03,532
Both of us have agreed
to work together. (Siren Wailing)

303
00:22:04,548 --> 00:22:08,007
We should trust each other.
If we set out to bump off someone..

304
00:22:09,433 --> 00:22:11,475
..we should cover each other.

305
00:22:12,676 --> 00:22:15,510
Else we won't be able to
bump him off. Got that?

306
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,445
Sir.

00:22:19,903 --> 00:22:20,945

00:22:21,903 --> 00:22:22,820
Come on.

310
00:22:24,742 --> 00:22:26,015
Sit down.

311
00:22:26,903 --> 00:22:29,737

313
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,195
Now get up. Sit over there.

00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:49,963
You must be thinking the department
has made an oldie your boss.

315
00:22:51,371 --> 00:22:53,565
But for me, you would be in this post.

316
00:22:54,807 --> 00:22:57,973
I made you sit in my chair
and rotated it.

317
00:22:58,397 --> 00:22:59,147
Why?
(Telephone Ringing)

318
00:23:00,778 --> 00:23:01,987
Because I am a fool.

319
00:23:02,783 --> 00:23:03,699
No, sir.

320
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:08,124
- I can't think of it.
- You can't think of it.

321
00:23:08,825 --> 00:23:09,957
How can you say it then?

322
00:23:13,903 --> 00:23:15,687
'This oldie is the boss now.'

323
00:23:16,801 --> 00:23:20,218
'But for him, I would be boss.'

324
00:23:21,945 --> 00:23:23,070
Sorry, sir.

325
00:23:24,112 --> 00:23:27,584
But it's true, sir.
If you weren't here then..

326
00:23:29,046 --> 00:23:30,379
..I would have sat in your chair.

327
00:23:30,486 --> 00:23:34,028
But I am here.
They called me back. Accept it.

328
00:23:34,362 --> 00:23:37,355
We'll have to work together
to solve the problem.

329
00:23:39,035 --> 00:23:41,196
You want this post.
You want the chair.

330
00:23:41,237 --> 00:23:44,166
I have taken the chair.
Will you sit in my lap?

331
00:23:45,354 --> 00:23:48,025
Henceforth, speak to me directly.

332
00:23:49,007 --> 00:23:52,007
Don't use other people's ears
as commode. Got that?

333
00:23:52,195 --> 00:23:53,362
- To err is human.
- Sir.

334
00:23:54,065 --> 00:23:54,815
Go on.

335
00:23:56,241 --> 00:23:57,235
Go find where the tea is.

337
00:24:32,955 --> 00:24:33,882
Take this.

338
00:24:35,734 --> 00:24:37,504
- Will you do it?
- Yes, sir.

339
00:24:38,385 --> 00:24:39,869
How can I forget you?

340
00:24:40,176 --> 00:24:42,926
- How is your son?
- He has been abroad for years.

341
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:45,840
How are things here?

342
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:47,856
God has been kind.

343
00:24:50,903 --> 00:24:52,528
- Here you are.
- What do I do with this?

344
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:54,112
Okay. See you.

345
00:24:54,572 --> 00:24:56,447
Things are different now.

346
00:24:56,695 --> 00:24:59,195
All the shooters have become businessmen.

347
00:24:59,859 --> 00:25:02,109
A gang has four to six
permanent shooters.

348
00:25:02,863 --> 00:25:04,321
The others work on daily basis.

349
00:25:04,362 --> 00:25:06,362
Outsourcing in the underworld?

350
00:25:06,862 --> 00:25:08,320
Where do they get shooters from?

351
00:25:08,361 --> 00:25:09,986
There are several in the market.

352
00:25:10,362 --> 00:25:12,028
Like fast food?

353
00:25:12,612 --> 00:25:14,487
You just have to hire them.

354
00:25:14,715 --> 00:25:19,007
They would think twice before
attacking a cop. Now things are different.

355
00:25:19,195 --> 00:25:22,528
Gangsters switch gangs every day.

356
00:25:22,635 --> 00:25:24,914
There's no professionalism
in this business.

357
00:25:25,421 --> 00:25:26,754
- Are you done?

..that I can deal with people
sitting right here in Mumbai.

May I know why the Home Minister..

536
00:35:11,987 --> 00:35:13,695
..called you back although
he has a plethora of officers?

537
00:35:13,827 --> 00:35:15,615
You are asking the wrong
question to the wrong man.

538
00:35:15,656 --> 00:35:17,989
You should ask this question
to the Home Minister.

539
00:35:19,237 --> 00:35:21,591
If he gives you an answer
then come and tell me as well.

540
00:35:21,632 --> 00:35:23,465
So you don't want to tell me.

541
00:35:24,737 --> 00:35:26,570
Sir, I know a lot about you.

542
00:35:27,112 --> 00:35:30,862
Those you killed, those you didn't.
Even why you killed them and why not.

543
00:35:31,279 --> 00:35:33,779
Why do such R&amp;D about me?

544
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:36,362
Not me, Anant Dixit did this R&amp;D.

545
00:35:37,653 --> 00:35:38,674
I am his daughter.

546
00:35:40,752 --> 00:35:42,501
It's a small world.

547
00:35:45,112 --> 00:35:46,987
You are Anant's daughter.

548
00:35:48,195 --> 00:35:50,528
Father was writing
a book on Encounter Cops.

549
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,403
- When..
- Aslam shot him.

550
00:35:54,445 --> 00:35:55,945
And then you shot Aslam.

551
00:35:57,737 --> 00:35:59,362
I want to complete that book.

552
00:35:59,445 --> 00:36:01,487
He genuinely understood the department.

553
00:36:02,195 --> 00:36:04,487
He never wrote anything
wrong about the department.

554
00:36:04,695 --> 00:36:06,612
I need your help in completing his book.

555
00:36:06,737 --> 00:36:08,664
Only you can supply
me with such information.

556
00:36:08,705 --> 00:36:10,195
The police department never gives..

557
00:36:10,236 --> 00:36:12,409
..any information until you
don't grease their palm.

558
00:36:13,153 --> 00:36:14,570
Normally pigeons and
crows shit in this place.

559
00:36:14,611 --> 00:36:16,028
We are lucky today.

560
00:36:16,141 --> 00:36:16,988
(Vehicles Honking)

561
00:36:17,029 --> 00:36:18,904
- Would you like something to eat?
- No, sir. Thank you.

562
00:36:18,945 --> 00:36:22,778
What can I offer?
Indian burger. Our staple food.

563
00:36:23,539 --> 00:36:26,666
Sir, you weren't here for a long time.
Where were you? What were you doing?

564
00:36:27,153 --> 00:36:29,737
- I was fishing in Goa.
- What?

565
00:36:31,153 --> 00:36:32,570
You want to know everything in one day.

566
00:36:32,611 --> 00:36:35,111
Forget about me,
tell me something about yourself.

567
00:36:35,945 --> 00:36:37,987
A series of professions and yet..

568
00:36:38,983 --> 00:36:41,441
..you became a crime reporter. Why?
(Vehicles Honking)

569
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:46,278
I didn't choose this profession,
it chose me.

570
00:36:47,658 --> 00:36:49,283
Father was on crime beat.

571
00:36:49,612 --> 00:36:51,191
All day he would talk
about the same thing at home.

572
00:36:51,445 --> 00:36:53,528
We would already know..

573
00:36:53,737 --> 00:36:55,820
..what people would
read in papers the next day.

574
00:36:56,195 --> 00:36:59,112
I would be surprised at how he knew it.

575
00:36:59,207 --> 00:37:01,882
Maybe that's when I decided..
(Vehicles Honking)

576
00:37:02,609 --> 00:37:04,321
..that I want to be a crime reporter.

577
00:37:04,362 --> 00:37:07,820
And then when that incident
occurred with him..

578
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,987
..I started hating this profession.

579
00:37:11,643 --> 00:37:14,059
But there was a subconscious attraction.

580
00:37:14,509 --> 00:37:16,301
And in this dilemma..

581
00:37:16,629 --> 00:37:19,338
..I don't know when
I took up this profession.

582
00:37:21,486 --> 00:37:22,820
And now, I love my job.

583
00:37:24,042 --> 00:37:25,667
Anant. Absolutely Anant.

584
00:37:25,859 --> 00:37:27,234
Like father like daughter.

585
00:37:27,863 --> 00:37:28,812
Am I boring you?

586
00:37:29,112 --> 00:37:31,028
Anant always asked the same question..

587
00:37:31,112 --> 00:37:32,945
..and I would always say, "Yes."
(Cell Phone Ringing)

588
00:37:35,811 --> 00:37:37,006
- Hello.
- (Honking)

589
00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:39,680
Yes.

590
00:37:41,979 --> 00:37:43,770
Okay. Okay.

591
00:37:45,154 --> 00:37:49,029
- Sorry. I have to go. I have a meeting.
- Okay.

592
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:50,403
- We will meet again?
- Yes.

593
00:37:50,797 --> 00:37:51,863
- Okay.
- Thank you.

594
00:37:51,948 --> 00:37:54,406
Okay. Finish your tea. Bye.

595
00:37:57,212 --> 00:37:58,571
(Car Engine Starting)

596
00:37:59,949 --> 00:38:01,283
You asked me to lead.

597
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:03,288
I did.

598
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:09,748
See... you are in focus
and we are out of focus.

599
00:38:11,028 --> 00:38:14,112
I asked the photographer
to keep all of you out of focus.

600
00:38:15,596 --> 00:38:16,929
What do you think?

601
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:19,132
Staying in focus will make you a hero?

602
00:38:20,028 --> 00:38:22,195
You have to pay a price
for staying in focus.

603
00:38:23,859 --> 00:38:26,109
I am not afraid of paying the price, sir.

604
00:38:27,445 --> 00:38:28,862
If you stay in focus..

605
00:38:29,487 --> 00:38:31,237
..many people will
be ready to kill you.

606
00:38:31,278 --> 00:38:33,862
Stay out of focus and
you live a little longer.

607
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:35,487
Everyone has to die, sir.

608
00:38:35,901 --> 00:38:37,901
So why not do it staying in focus?

609
00:38:39,473 --> 00:38:42,348
At least my son should
know who he is idolizing.

610
00:38:44,908 --> 00:38:46,908
Next time I will ask
him to keep you in focus..

611
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:50,275
..for the sake of your son.

612
00:38:50,528 --> 00:38:52,445
He will never change.

613
00:38:54,476 --> 00:38:56,793
Killing you is easier
than explaining to you.

614
00:38:56,834 --> 00:39:00,313
(Background Music)

615
00:39:01,029 --> 00:39:04,862
In '98 we had similar information.

616
00:39:04,996 --> 00:39:06,697
There was a new recruit, Bingar Dhiwe.

617
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,557
Zestful like you.

618
00:39:08,598 --> 00:39:10,348
In the chaos I shot him.
(Birds Chirping)

619
00:39:11,416 --> 00:39:13,374
He was shot on his right shoulder.

620
00:39:13,898 --> 00:39:16,273
It was an accident.
He got well later.

621
00:39:16,668 --> 00:39:18,418
Anything can happen.

622
00:39:19,891 --> 00:39:23,523
Suryakant, you lead today.

623
00:39:24,679 --> 00:39:25,387
Me?

624
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:28,971
- Yes.
- No, sir.

625
00:39:29,205 --> 00:39:30,570
- I don't want to, sir.
- Why?

626
00:39:30,987 --> 00:39:33,453
- You lead the team.
- You will be in focus. (Eagle Screaming)

627
00:39:35,477 --> 00:39:36,728
What focus, sir?

628
00:39:37,114 --> 00:39:38,156
I was just joking, sir.

629
00:39:38,254 --> 00:39:40,879
I am not joking, honestly.
What do you think, Kazi?

630
00:39:41,112 --> 00:39:42,862
- Yes.
- Yes what?

631
00:39:43,445 --> 00:39:44,992
What?

632
00:39:45,612 --> 00:39:47,278
Sir is senior.

633
00:39:47,487 --> 00:39:49,461
Sir, you lead the way.
We are there, sir.

634
00:39:49,854 --> 00:39:50,937
We are behind you, sir.

635
00:39:50,985 --> 00:39:54,152
I never shot anyone.
I was just joking.

636
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:55,667
Come on.

637
00:39:57,548 --> 00:39:59,631
- No, sir. Not for that, sir.
- What?

638
00:40:00,105 --> 00:40:02,197
Not for that, sir. You do it.
We are there.

639
00:40:03,204 --> 00:40:07,016
(Birds Chirping)

640
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:13,469
(Background Music)

641
00:40:24,612 --> 00:40:26,862
Forget him.
You stay here.

642
00:40:26,949 --> 00:40:28,092
Ghorpade, come here.

643
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:31,212
You go, Kazi. Go there.

644
00:40:31,376 --> 00:40:36,712
(Background Music Continues)

645
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:57,862
'Zestful like you.'

646
00:40:57,903 --> 00:40:59,594
'In the chaos I shot him.'

647
00:41:02,579 --> 00:41:04,065
(Footsteps)

648
00:41:04,106 --> 00:41:07,106
- Sadhu sir?
- He is on the other side of the boat.

649
00:41:22,653 --> 00:41:25,737
'It was an accident.
It can happen anything at anytime'.

650
00:41:26,612 --> 00:41:27,695
Sadhu sir?

651
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:46,528
'Suryakant.'

652
00:41:49,487 --> 00:41:50,612
Go that way.

653
00:41:52,036 --> 00:41:54,286
'Killing you is easier
than explaining to you.'

654
00:41:54,327 --> 00:41:58,063
(Background Music)

655
00:42:09,431 --> 00:42:11,057
'In the chaos I shot him'.

656
00:42:18,487 --> 00:42:20,463
Toba, I am going to take a nap.

657
00:42:20,504 --> 00:42:22,945
Take a nap once you finish working.

658
00:42:23,028 --> 00:42:24,778
- Come on.
- Fine.

659
00:42:48,914 --> 00:42:50,907
(Groans)

660
00:42:58,587 --> 00:43:00,360
(Gunshots)

661
00:43:00,401 --> 00:43:01,633
(Eagles Screaming)

662
00:43:01,741 --> 00:43:04,866
We managed to achieve
a lot in such a short time.

663
00:43:05,653 --> 00:43:09,362
What makes me most proud is that
an officer like Sadhu is with us.

664
00:43:09,869 --> 00:43:12,702
And seems like our goal is not far.

665
00:43:12,778 --> 00:43:14,195
- Sir.
- Here comes Sadhu.

666
00:43:14,695 --> 00:43:16,153
- Sir.
- Come, Sadhu. (Telephone Ringing)

667
00:43:16,528 --> 00:43:18,070
We were talking about you.

668
00:43:18,612 --> 00:43:21,112
I feel proud that we have officers
like you in our system.

669
00:43:21,153 --> 00:43:24,903
Sir. Compared to you
we are doing nothing.

670
00:43:25,945 --> 00:43:28,403
- You are being modest.
- No, sir.

671
00:43:28,737 --> 00:43:30,486
Your deeds, your ideals..

672
00:43:31,112 --> 00:43:33,320
..no one in Maharashtra
can match up to them.

673
00:43:33,547 --> 00:43:34,993
(Telephone Ringing)

674
00:43:36,653 --> 00:43:37,799
Yes.

675
00:43:39,987 --> 00:43:41,487
Hold on. Hold on.

676
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:44,195
- Sadhu.
- Sir.

677
00:43:44,308 --> 00:43:48,267
What I regret is that as long
as Gandhi was pinned up on walls..

678
00:43:48,695 --> 00:43:49,733
..we idolized him.

679
00:43:50,054 --> 00:43:51,346
Once we started printing
him on currencies..

680
00:43:51,387 --> 00:43:52,466
..we forgot about him.

681
00:43:53,737 --> 00:43:58,528
Their responsibility ends
after felicitating their ideals.

682
00:43:58,666 --> 00:44:01,540
This is what the new
generation thinks. What to do?

683
00:44:02,070 --> 00:44:04,737
Sadhu, the way you
are leading your squad..

684
00:44:04,778 --> 00:44:06,778
..in annihilating these
anti-social elements..

685
00:44:06,862 --> 00:44:10,778
..one needs a set of ideals
and unlimited courage to do that.

686
00:44:11,362 --> 00:44:13,153
- Well done.
- Thank you, sir.

687
00:44:13,529 --> 00:44:14,560
Thank you.

688
00:44:14,737 --> 00:44:16,486
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

689
00:44:18,112 --> 00:44:19,903
So this is what I was talking about?

690
00:44:21,612 --> 00:44:24,445
Jagirdar and Anna sir are good people.

691
00:44:26,081 --> 00:44:28,747
It's hard to find such
people in politics these days.

692
00:44:30,487 --> 00:44:33,153
Okay, father.
Then I will join politics.

693
00:44:33,815 --> 00:44:35,023
Become a leader.

694
00:44:35,369 --> 00:44:37,619
And anyway, you don't want me
to take up music as a profession.

695
00:44:37,695 --> 00:44:38,528
I never said that.

696
00:44:38,569 --> 00:44:41,444
I only said that you should take up
something else along with music.

697
00:44:41,601 --> 00:44:43,445
If you want to enter politics,
then go ahead.

698
00:44:43,574 --> 00:44:45,908
But remember, politics is not a business.

699
00:44:46,862 --> 00:44:47,563
It's a profession.

700
00:44:47,604 --> 00:44:50,262
If you want to do something for
the people then go ahead. (Doorbell)

701
00:44:50,445 --> 00:44:52,071
Sit, sit, sit. I will open the door.

702
00:44:55,571 --> 00:44:56,305
- Come.
- Hi, sir.

703
00:44:56,346 --> 00:44:57,691
Welcome. Welcome.

704
00:44:58,445 --> 00:44:59,487
Aman.

705
00:45:00,035 --> 00:45:02,202
She is my friend's daughter, Shalu.

706
00:45:02,445 --> 00:45:03,653
- Hi.
- Hi.

707
00:45:03,694 --> 00:45:06,152
Her father was writing
a book on encounter cops.

708
00:45:06,278 --> 00:45:08,070
It was left incomplete.
She is completing that.

709
00:45:08,153 --> 00:45:09,278
My son Aman.

710
00:45:10,903 --> 00:45:12,153
Does he play the piano?

711
00:45:13,237 --> 00:45:14,362
He writes too.

712
00:45:14,403 --> 00:45:15,282
Oh!

713
00:45:15,528 --> 00:45:18,487
You two writers can chat while
I get something for you to eat.

714
00:45:18,562 --> 00:45:20,937
- Father, please don't make eggs.
- No eggs today.

715
00:45:21,028 --> 00:45:24,195
Today I will make your mother's
special 'Sambhar' (Lentil).

716
00:45:24,278 --> 00:45:26,903
Remember what your mother
would call 'Hing' (asafetida)?

717
00:45:27,454 --> 00:45:29,883
- She called it 'Hing'. What else?
- Hey, Mozart.

718
00:45:32,309 --> 00:45:34,101
Rest of the world call it 'Hing'..

719
00:45:34,153 --> 00:45:35,778
..your mother would call it 'Kayam'.

720
00:45:36,827 --> 00:45:39,577
- Nice house, sir.
- It's nice.

721
00:45:40,010 --> 00:45:43,051
Given to me by the government.
Feels like my native place. Nice. Sit.

722
00:45:43,665 --> 00:45:46,899
(Piano Playing)

723
00:45:47,112 --> 00:45:48,570
- Aman.
- Yes.

724
00:45:49,028 --> 00:45:51,945
I need your help too for that book.

725
00:45:52,237 --> 00:45:53,237
Me?

726
00:45:58,094 --> 00:46:00,321
(Cell Phone Ringing)

727
00:46:04,445 --> 00:46:06,195
- Hello.
- Hello, Sadhu sir.

728
00:46:07,071 --> 00:46:09,571
- We have a tip on Eijaz.
- Okay.

729
00:46:09,612 --> 00:46:12,153
- He is coming tonight.
- When is he leaving?

730
00:46:16,992 --> 00:46:18,992
- I am sorry to bring this up.
- No. It's okay.

731
00:46:19,541 --> 00:46:22,999
You were there when your mother was shot?

732
00:46:23,174 --> 00:46:23,757
Yes.

733
00:46:25,403 --> 00:46:28,278
What was your father's mental condition?

734
00:46:28,807 --> 00:46:32,848
I can't remember clearly,
but it was chaotic.

735
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:34,635
I was quite scared.

736
00:46:35,148 --> 00:46:39,936
Father... wasn't calm,
but he was amazingly composed.

737
00:46:41,445 --> 00:46:43,653
I never understood him all these years.

738
00:46:44,278 --> 00:46:45,987
Even though I am his son,
I never understood him.

739
00:46:46,070 --> 00:46:48,052
Confirm the flight number and inform me.

740
00:46:49,188 --> 00:46:50,063
(Doorbell)

741
00:46:50,104 --> 00:46:51,104
Sir, shall I open it?

742
00:46:51,778 --> 00:46:53,026
- Who is that?
- Postman.

743
00:46:53,067 --> 00:46:57,172
(Background Music)

744
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:25,002
What is it?

745
00:47:25,070 --> 00:47:26,612
- Registered mail.
- What name?

746
00:47:26,695 --> 00:47:27,820
Sadhu Agashe.

747
00:47:32,995 --> 00:47:34,354
(Gunshots)

748
00:47:40,026 --> 00:47:41,948

(Groans)

752

(Cell Phone Ringing)

753
00:49:00,267 --> 00:49:01,142
Sadhu.

754
00:49:01,901 --> 00:49:02,776
Father.

755
00:49:05,441 --> 00:49:06,650
I got your letter.

756
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:10,778
Your postman is lying here.

757
00:49:10,819 --> 00:49:13,360
My postman? I didn't understand.

758
00:49:15,343 --> 00:49:17,718
I have called to thank you.

759
00:49:19,775 --> 00:49:24,441
You did my work by killing
Krishna and Qureshi.

760
00:49:25,987 --> 00:49:27,778
They were betraying me.

761
00:49:29,333 --> 00:49:30,292
Thanks.

762
00:49:33,101 --> 00:49:37,018
You have kept yourself
physically fit even at this age.

763
00:49:37,778 --> 00:49:41,028
That's why you overpowered
people half your age.

764
00:49:41,851 --> 00:49:44,518
Sir, when you are facing death,
everything becomes easy.

765
00:49:44,858 --> 00:49:46,900
A cop should stay fit not
just when he is in the force..

766
00:49:46,941 --> 00:49:48,858
..but also when he is retired.

767
00:49:50,152 --> 00:49:51,445
Bullets don't give consideration to age.

768
00:49:51,486 --> 00:49:53,112
Who knows when one might need it?

769
00:49:55,351 --> 00:49:57,893
I have reached the retiring age,
Sadhu, not you.

770
00:49:58,903 --> 00:49:59,862
Come.

771
00:50:01,077 --> 00:50:02,369
But I feel..

772
00:50:02,918 --> 00:50:03,710
Thank you.

773
00:50:06,752 --> 00:50:10,043
I feel... when a man reaches this age..

774
00:50:10,624 --> 00:50:16,693
..his ability to rationalize
and exploit people gets better.

775
00:50:17,445 --> 00:50:20,839
That's why the politicians of our
country don't want to retire.

776
00:50:21,028 --> 00:50:21,903
Maybe.

777
00:50:21,944 --> 00:50:24,418
(Birds Chirping)

778
00:50:26,441 --> 00:50:28,400
- But one thing, Sadhu.
- Sir.

779
00:50:29,070 --> 00:50:31,821
Whenever a man reaches
the peak of his career..

780
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:33,959
..with the experience
he has garnered..

781
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:37,028
..he wants to do something
for the society and the country.

782
00:50:37,112 --> 00:50:40,921
And that's when our system retires him.

783
00:50:42,799 --> 00:50:43,715
Irony.

784
00:50:46,653 --> 00:50:51,987
Everyone is busy increasing their
vote bank and Swiss Bank figures.

785
00:50:53,486 --> 00:50:57,945
No one has time or intention to think
for the interest of the people.

786
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:01,691
If we have a few more
politicians like Jagirdar sir..

787
00:51:02,583 --> 00:51:04,708
..then something is
possible in the future.

788
00:51:05,112 --> 00:51:06,528
People say that his past..

789
00:51:06,569 --> 00:51:09,985
I am thinking of the future
and you are stuck in the past.

790
00:51:10,895 --> 00:51:12,785
(Honking)

791
00:51:13,643 --> 00:51:15,643
There are always allegations
against politicians.

792
00:51:16,851 --> 00:51:18,893
But take it from me.
He is a very genuine guy.

793
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:20,863
(Cell Phone Ringing)

794
00:51:24,905 --> 00:51:26,571
Yes, Rawle. What is it?

795
00:51:26,643 --> 00:51:30,018
Sadhu, I found out about your postman.

796
00:51:31,333 --> 00:51:35,250
- You were amazing.
- Let's meet and I will do better.

797
00:51:35,291 --> 00:51:35,910
(Laughs)

798
00:51:36,023 --> 00:51:37,315
You never met again.

799
00:51:37,848 --> 00:51:40,494
I am driving at the moment.
Here, talk to Shalu.

800
00:51:40,535 --> 00:51:41,869
She is a crime reporter.

801
00:51:42,362 --> 00:51:43,904
She will print your
interview on the first page.

802
00:51:43,945 --> 00:51:44,903
Here. Talk to her.

803
00:51:45,757 --> 00:51:47,090
What will I say to Rawle?

804
00:51:47,446 --> 00:51:49,196
You are a journalist, ask him anything.

805
00:51:49,237 --> 00:51:50,903
- But still.
- What?

806
00:51:50,987 --> 00:51:52,903
- Ask him about his girlfriend.
- Girlfriend?

807
00:51:53,367 --> 00:51:54,659
Are you mocking me?

808
00:51:55,314 --> 00:51:58,230
You got emotional when
asked about your girlfriend.

809
00:51:59,195 --> 00:52:00,820
Did it remind you of an old wound?

810
00:52:01,528 --> 00:52:02,653
He hung up?

811
00:52:13,654 --> 00:52:16,446
Tell Manya I want news about
Sadhu's every movement.

812
00:52:16,487 --> 00:52:17,403
Yes, boss.

813
00:52:17,695 --> 00:52:19,237
Boss, Prasad is here.

814
00:52:20,957 --> 00:52:22,582
Why you called him here at this hour?

815
00:52:22,921 --> 00:52:24,254
Boss, he wants to apologize.

816
00:52:24,409 --> 00:52:26,242
He says he was mistaken.

817
00:52:26,426 --> 00:52:28,760
And what is the guarantee
he won't make a mistake again?

818
00:52:28,882 --> 00:52:30,152
I guarantee that, boss.

819
00:52:32,090 --> 00:52:33,715
I know him well.

820
00:52:34,903 --> 00:52:35,903
Call him.

821
00:52:37,567 --> 00:52:38,859
Send him in.

822
00:52:42,903 --> 00:52:43,737
Rawle..

823
00:52:50,501 --> 00:52:52,909
There is just one way
to clear misconceptions.

824
00:52:55,548 --> 00:52:59,590
Forget about yourself,
never vouch for others.

825
00:52:59,865 --> 00:53:01,490
People change with time.

826
00:53:01,651 --> 00:53:05,776
I need a trustworthy boy
in Mumbai in place of Krishna.

827
00:53:08,695 --> 00:53:10,028
Your brother's son.

828
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:12,737
- What's his name?
- Babu.

829
00:53:14,278 --> 00:53:15,320
Appoint him on the job.

830
00:53:17,945 --> 00:53:21,987
But I will give someone
more trustworthy and capable.

831
00:53:22,028 --> 00:53:24,028
No. I want Babu.

832
00:53:25,408 --> 00:53:27,199
I don't want any guarantee for him.

833
00:53:28,322 --> 00:53:29,697
You are there.

834
00:53:32,945 --> 00:53:35,237
We have received news
from IB Delhi that..

835
00:53:35,278 --> 00:53:39,278
..the underworld is trying to carry out
a big terrorist activity in Mumbai.

836
00:53:39,945 --> 00:53:42,028
I thought Rawle is behind it.

837
00:53:43,487 --> 00:53:45,362
But the IB says it's not Rawle.

838
00:53:45,653 --> 00:53:47,362
Rauf is going to do this job.

839
00:53:48,653 --> 00:53:50,350
We have to eliminate both.

840
00:53:51,278 --> 00:53:54,445
But for the time being
you concentrate on Rauf.

841
00:53:55,362 --> 00:53:56,612
- Sir.
- Yes. Tell me.

842
00:53:56,653 --> 00:54:00,486
Manya is coming to meet Jadhav
this evening at his cow-shed.

(Indistinct)

844
00:54:01,765 --> 00:54:03,890
- Is the news confirmed?
- Yes, Mushtaq.

845
00:54:04,486 --> 00:54:07,682
Last night he was
with Shabnam and Ruksana.

846
00:54:07,723 --> 00:54:10,765
Remember, if the news is wrong,
I will shoot you.

847
00:54:11,059 --> 00:54:12,684
Why would I lie to you, son?

848
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:14,780
- But my reward?
- You will get it.

849
00:54:18,195 --> 00:54:19,820
- Boss.
- What is it?

850
00:54:20,749 --> 00:54:22,291
Boss, we have a tip on Manya.

851
00:54:23,945 --> 00:54:27,029
Here are 500,000 rupees
and a plane ticket.

852
00:54:27,070 --> 00:54:28,585
Stay in your village for four months.

- Mushtaq.
- Yes.

869
00:57:07,528 --> 00:57:09,457
You handle this side.
I will handle things there.

You spilled Mustaq's blood on milk.

874
00:58:18,534 --> 00:58:19,909
Now watch.

875
00:58:20,362 --> 00:58:24,820
I will spill yours and
Jagirdar's blood on cow-dung.

Lord has made nine holes in a human body.

Two ears, two nostrils, two eyes.
One mouth.

880
00:58:37,195 --> 00:58:39,070
And you know the other two.

881
00:58:40,028 --> 00:58:42,820
If you dream about hurting Jagirdar..

882
00:58:43,346 --> 00:58:45,054
..I will make the 10th hole.

883
00:58:49,484 --> 00:58:51,651
For the society, we cops..

884
00:58:53,906 --> 00:58:55,865
..are wrong if we do something wrong..

885

..and even if we do something right.

got a son like Aman.

01:14:41,691 --> 01:14:47,900
Do you know who has ordered
Rawle to kill Anna Saheb?

1067
01:14:49,397 --> 01:14:53,439
You will be shocked to hear his name.

(Gunshots)

1069
01:14:55,355 --> 01:14:58,022
It was an order from the top brass.

1070
01:14:59,968 --> 01:15:02,406
To kill Rauf and to follow you.

1071
01:15:03,855 --> 01:15:06,647
You killed. I killed. It was an order.

(Background Music)

1074
01:15:25,196 --> 01:15:27,696
Rauf was lying even before he died.

1075
01:15:28,717 --> 01:15:29,733
What did he say?

1076
01:15:30,710 --> 01:15:33,335
He said that Rawle has accepted
a contract to kill Anna Saheb.

1077
01:15:33,711 --> 01:15:35,208
Who will want to kill Anna Saheb?

1078
01:15:35,249 --> 01:15:41,374
Before he could say
anything Suryakant shot him.

1079
01:15:43,431 --> 01:15:45,639
But Rauf was blabbering.

1080
01:15:47,213 --> 01:15:50,421
He was trying to distract
me so that he could escape.

1081
01:15:50,584 --> 01:15:52,625
This is what criminals usually do.

1082
01:15:52,666 --> 01:15:54,457
He also said that..

1083
01:15:56,587 --> 01:15:59,170
..not him but Rawle had killed Aman.

1084
01:16:02,042 --> 01:16:04,625
I have heard that Rawle
is returning to India.

1085
01:16:04,666 --> 01:16:06,457
Is he planning to die?

- Sadhu.

Come and meet me at

1097

How are you connected to Rawle?

1104
01:17:20,569 --> 01:17:21,945
- Call Pawar.
- Yes.

1105
01:17:24,093 --> 01:17:25,426
I am impressed.

1106
01:17:26,764 --> 01:17:29,125
I knew that you would
come to know of it one day.

- Sir.

1109

- Yes.
- Mr. Pawar is here.

Tell him to arrange a long trailer.
A long one.

1111
01:17:39,945 --> 01:17:40,820
Yes.

1112
01:17:42,208 --> 01:17:46,052
Everyone in politics wishes to lead.

1113
01:17:46,250 --> 01:17:48,916

Anna Saheb was there.

- Yes, sir.

I need flags. It should
look like the tri colored flag.

Politicians need both
the underworld and police..

..to control the system.

do can be done by the rogues.

It is important that a
city shouldn't have two gangs.

Otherwise a third might
use the second gang.

to get rid of the people..

..who were against me in politics.

1127

..rid of people who were
against me in the underworld.

1131

And he was forced to
appoint me as home minister.

You dealt with Rauf.

1136

So now Rawle will also stay quite now.
This is politics.

to use things at the right time.

to mess up good things..

..and how to straighten up bad things.

had been brought here is over.

no one will trust you.

the people love me.

paid by the underworld.

..there are no proofs against him.

1201
01:25:42,839 --> 01:25:46,923

that the encounter squad..

still require the encounter squad?

1204

I don't think so.

..convicted of the
crimes he is accused of..

that in democracy it is..

..not right to call someone
a criminal till he is convicted.

didn't die of natural causes.

It is being investigated
and it will be completed.

us what steps are being taken..

01:27:28,173 --> 01:27:30,214
..to complete the investigation
of his assassination...

1237
01:27:30,255 --> 01:27:32,255
Let me speak. Sit down.

1238
01:27:32,333 --> 01:27:34,495
- It was an assassination.
- Yes, I know.

1239
01:27:35,585 --> 01:27:38,836
Teach her. Where do
these kids come from?

1240
01:27:38,989 --> 01:27:41,114
What is the name of your university?
What is your name?

1241
01:27:41,214 --> 01:27:42,089
Shalu Dixit.

1242
01:27:45,131 --> 01:27:46,368
Shalu Dixit.

1243
01:27:46,409 --> 01:27:48,880
(Background Music)

1244
01:27:49,169 --> 01:27:51,537
Don't underestimate that girl.

1245
01:27:51,964 --> 01:27:53,365
She is very intelligent.

1246
01:27:57,798 --> 01:27:59,127
Very intelligent.

1247
01:27:59,737 --> 01:28:00,716
I know sir.

1248
01:28:01,316 --> 01:28:03,108
She is also connected to Sadhu.

1249
01:28:06,002 --> 01:28:07,326
Very intelligent.

1250
01:28:09,209 --> 01:28:10,459
Okay, sir.

1251
01:28:13,173 --> 01:28:15,776
Sir, I have got proof of
connection of Rawle and Jagirdar.

1252
01:28:17,237 --> 01:28:19,404
I am in Bandra right now.
I am heading to Sachivalaya.

1253
01:28:19,833 --> 01:28:21,926
Behind the Gandhiji Park. Let's go.

1254
01:28:22,216 --> 01:28:23,895
(Tyre Screeching Sound)

1255
01:28:26,411 --> 01:28:27,482
Take this.

1256
01:28:27,693 --> 01:28:32,036
(Background Music)

1257
01:28:33,839 --> 01:28:35,631
Yes, I am here. Where are you?

1258
01:28:37,974 --> 01:28:39,901
(Honking)

1259
01:28:44,923 --> 01:28:47,131
Hello? Jyoti.

1260
01:28:50,125 --> 01:28:51,958
I will tell you the reason later.

1261
01:28:53,423 --> 01:28:56,506
A few weeks back Jagirdar's PA Keshav..

1262
01:28:57,251 --> 01:28:59,251
..had gone to London to meet Rawle.

1263
01:28:59,349 --> 01:29:01,171
To give him the contract
to kill Anna Saheb.

1264
01:29:01,316 --> 01:29:04,108
Rawle made me record this meeting.

1265
01:29:04,619 --> 01:29:07,536
So that if ever Jagirdar
plots against Rawle..

1266
01:29:08,107 --> 01:29:10,982
..then even Rawle will be
able to use this CD against Jagirdar.

1267
01:29:11,298 --> 01:29:14,423
I made a copy of that
CD without informing Rawle.

1268
01:29:14,552 --> 01:29:17,877
We no longer have
an amiable relationship.

1269
01:29:18,506 --> 01:29:22,173
Now I will avenge whatever
he had done to me by killing him.

1270
01:29:22,214 --> 01:29:24,599
(Tyre Screeching Sound)

1271
01:29:27,825 --> 01:29:28,881
The CD...

1272
01:29:28,922 --> 01:29:30,177
(Groan)

1273
01:29:35,658 --> 01:29:37,861
(Gunshots)
(Vehicle Sound)

1274
01:29:46,915 --> 01:29:49,072
(Vehicle Passing By)

1275
01:29:55,256 --> 01:29:56,339
Shalu.

1276
01:29:58,839 --> 01:29:59,881
Shalu.

1277
01:30:11,701 --> 01:30:12,451
Look.

1278
01:30:14,964 --> 01:30:17,339
- Sir. What is the matter, sir?
- Sir?

1279
01:30:17,881 --> 01:30:20,173
Shalu is in the ICU. Stay outside.

1280
01:30:20,299 --> 01:30:21,632
- Take care of her.
- Yes, sir.

1281
01:30:21,673 --> 01:30:23,589
- Stay here.
- But sir you...

1282
01:30:23,630 --> 01:30:27,934
(Background Music)

1283
01:30:29,839 --> 01:30:34,964
Whatever I say anything
about Anna Sir is less.

1284
01:30:35,235 --> 01:30:39,360
He was more attached since college
days into social movement.

1285
01:30:39,458 --> 01:30:40,791
He was a part of it.

1286
01:30:40,832 --> 01:30:43,054
Society was only his family.

1287
01:30:43,652 --> 01:30:46,925
He dedicated his whole life
into the society.

1288
01:30:47,339 --> 01:30:50,214
And he even said that
the root of the sadness,

1289
01:30:50,255 --> 01:30:52,213
Is because of economic inequality.

1290
01:30:52,254 --> 01:30:56,429
We have to get rid of this problem.

1291
01:30:56,881 --> 01:31:02,631
I had promised Anna Saheb
that I will fulfill his dream.

1292
01:31:02,756 --> 01:31:03,839
But I...

1293
01:31:03,880 --> 01:31:08,184
(Background Music)

1294
01:31:13,923 --> 01:31:18,006
I am just a medium.

1295
01:31:18,715 --> 01:31:19,958
I want...

1296
01:31:23,637 --> 01:31:24,856
Your support.

1297
01:31:26,142 --> 01:31:30,892
Anna Saheb worked till his last breath..

1298
01:31:31,589 --> 01:31:33,756
..to change our weak system.

1299
01:31:34,048 --> 01:31:37,547
So we will have to
change this system forever.

1300
01:31:38,781 --> 01:31:42,489
Anna Saheb had dreamt
of a self-sufficient..

1301
01:31:42,896 --> 01:31:46,354
..self-reliant and
an advanced Maharashtra.

1302
01:31:47,932 --> 01:31:51,515
And we fulfilling his
dream will be the best way..

1303
01:31:51,560 --> 01:31:54,310
..to portray our regards for him.

1304
01:32:02,786 --> 01:32:05,423
Hail India. Hail Maharashtra.

1305
01:32:05,464 --> 01:32:09,317
(Background Music)

1306
01:32:19,673 --> 01:32:21,048
You have taken the right decision.

1307
01:32:21,089 --> 01:32:23,006
- Welcome to the system.
- Thank you, sir.

1308
01:32:23,089 --> 01:32:25,464
May I say a few words about Anna Saheb?

1309
01:32:26,058 --> 01:32:27,183
Yes.

1310
01:32:27,547 --> 01:32:28,798
- Thank you.
- Go.

1311
01:32:37,360 --> 01:32:39,776
I pay homage to Anna Saheb.

1312
01:32:43,026 --> 01:32:47,289
I have not touched
anyone's feet till date.

1313
01:32:47,822 --> 01:32:50,572
That includes my parents,
teacher and God.

1314
01:32:52,145 --> 01:32:55,089
But I touched his because
he has changed my life.

1315
01:32:55,130 --> 01:32:58,268
(Background Music)

1316
01:32:58,590 --> 01:33:00,257
You might know me.

1317
01:33:00,298 --> 01:33:02,547
I am Sadhu Agashe. Encounter Cop.

1318
01:33:03,076 --> 01:33:04,701
I clean up garbage.

1319
01:33:06,385 --> 01:33:09,427
If garbage gets collected
in your area for 7-8 days..

1320
01:33:10,451 --> 01:33:12,451
..the place becomes full of stench.

1321
01:33:12,888 --> 01:33:16,971
The garbage van comes, cleans off
area and the stench disappears.

1322
01:33:19,112 --> 01:33:21,821
In the same way when crime
rate increases in the society..

1323
01:33:23,381 --> 01:33:28,089
..great people like Jagirdar call
people like us to clean up.

1324
01:33:32,386 --> 01:33:34,928
Usually there are no
witnesses for encounters.

1325
01:33:35,464 --> 01:33:37,589
We do this dirty work in private.

1326
01:33:37,964 --> 01:33:39,339
So that there is no proof.

1327
01:33:39,380 --> 01:33:43,088
But I want to do one encounter
in front of everyone.

1328
01:33:43,129 --> 01:33:47,214
(Background Music)

1329
01:33:51,195 --> 01:33:54,778
So that people ask
me why I have done this.

1330
01:34:00,495 --> 01:34:02,675
(Groan)

1331
01:34:04,256 --> 01:34:05,547
Stop him.

1332
01:34:05,588 --> 01:34:09,808
(Gasps)

1333
01:34:09,849 --> 01:34:14,136
(Shouts)

1334
01:34:25,901 --> 01:34:27,274
Hey!

1335
01:34:27,315 --> 01:34:28,482
Take care. Take care of him.

1336
01:34:28,523 --> 01:34:30,774
Go and get the ambulance.

1337
01:34:30,815 --> 01:34:35,643
(Shouts)

1338
01:34:43,558 --> 01:34:46,417
(Siren Wailing)
(Camera Clicks)

1339
01:34:53,464 --> 01:34:56,401
(Shouts)

1340
01:35:03,104 --> 01:35:07,857
When I left the force I
had done 56 encounters.

1341
01:35:09,539 --> 01:35:12,331
This one encounter is equal to 56.

1342
01:35:16,464 --> 01:35:18,464
The matter didn't end here.

1343
01:35:18,673 --> 01:35:20,423
This was just the beginning.

1344
01:35:23,089 --> 01:35:26,006
This will happen. This should happen.

1345
01:35:28,089 --> 01:35:30,131
Many such people like Jagirdar are..

1346
01:35:31,427 --> 01:35:34,844
..powerful personas in politics.

1347
01:35:35,228 --> 01:35:39,519
They have different names
but they are same.

1348
01:35:43,173 --> 01:35:46,465
It is the responsibility
of the new generation..

1349
01:35:46,513 --> 01:35:51,096
..to finish off this dirt altogether.

1350
01:35:53,339 --> 01:35:56,464
Such politicians are the biggest mafia.

1351
01:35:59,048 --> 01:36:02,464
We cannot do anything
against them lawfully.

1352
01:36:02,549 --> 01:36:05,258
They should be encountered like this.

1353
01:36:07,526 --> 01:36:09,860
In front of everyone. In public.

1354
01:36:11,401 --> 01:36:13,443
We need a force for that.

1355
01:36:16,839 --> 01:36:21,173
I am sure they will
do it for their future.

1356
01:36:22,193 --> 01:36:23,651
They will have to do it.

1357
01:36:24,376 --> 01:36:27,667
I have run so far. Now they will run.

1358
01:36:29,089 --> 01:36:31,547
I don't know what you think about me.

1359
01:36:32,547 --> 01:36:34,631
But I am proud to be a cop..

1360
01:36:37,149 --> 01:36:39,357
..and always will be a cop.

1361
01:36:39,398 --> 01:36:42,729
(Background Music)

1362
01:36:42,849 --> 01:36:45,729
I must say thanks to my child Aman.

1363
01:36:46,214 --> 01:36:49,589
He insisted.
Because of him I came back to force.

1364
01:36:49,673 --> 01:36:50,663
Thank you.

1365
01:36:53,547 --> 01:36:56,298
You might feel that
I did this for myself.

1366
01:36:57,423 --> 01:36:59,214
Do you think it is personal?

1367
01:37:01,214 --> 01:37:02,753
I don't think so.

1368
01:37:02,794 --> 01:37:08,183

01:37:19,784 --> 01:37:21,701
Take care of Aman.

(Background Music)

1372
01:37:30,083 --> 01:37:30,832
I will.

1373

(Background Music Continues)
