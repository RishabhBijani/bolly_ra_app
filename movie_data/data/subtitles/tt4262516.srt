1
00:05:52,692 --> 00:05:56,765
"Sweetheart."

2
00:06:08,942 --> 00:06:10,046
Smile.

3
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:31,168
Smile.

4
00:06:31,798 --> 00:06:32,970
Smile.

5
00:06:34,067 --> 00:06:35,239
Smile.

6
00:06:36,169 --> 00:06:38,274
Panditji that's just a stone.

7
00:06:59,526 --> 00:07:01,005
Smile.

8
00:07:15,842 --> 00:07:17,253
You're my slave.

9
00:07:18,211 --> 00:07:22,125
Your soul is in my grasp.
- What sir?

10
00:07:22,349 --> 00:07:24,454
So what if it's new year's eve today.

11
00:07:25,118 --> 00:07:27,359
You want to go to US as
the project manager, don't you?

12
00:07:27,454 --> 00:07:28,159
Yes, sir.

13
00:07:28,221 --> 00:07:31,100
Then always remember
what Shakspeare said.

14
00:07:32,893 --> 00:07:36,397
The Day was Not
built in Rome. - Yes.

15
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:39,401
You can't make an omelet
without breaking the egg.

16
00:07:39,466 --> 00:07:40,206
What, sir?

17
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,871
Go back to your seat
and break your eggs.

18
00:07:43,003 --> 00:07:44,004
Complete the report!

19
00:07:45,338 --> 00:07:46,408
Stupid.

20
00:07:47,374 --> 00:07:48,318
Hi, baby.

21
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:49,815
I hope your husband isn't home.

22
00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:55,357
Remember what Shakspeare said.

23
00:07:56,850 --> 00:08:00,059
'My body is ever at your service'.

24
00:08:00,887 --> 00:08:02,059
I am coming darling.

25
00:08:09,062 --> 00:08:10,097
Pintu!

26
00:08:10,563 --> 00:08:11,598
Yes, sir.

27
00:08:13,433 --> 00:08:14,969
Tell me sir.
- Get me a cup of coffee.

28
00:08:15,302 --> 00:08:16,610
How many more cups
are you going to have, sir?

29
00:08:16,903 --> 00:08:17,973
It's new year today.

30
00:08:18,405 --> 00:08:20,043
This is the time to
break out the bottles.

31
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,377
Don't be so scared.
Just go.

32
00:08:24,444 --> 00:08:26,947
"This is Mumbai, the city of dreams".

33
00:08:27,013 --> 00:08:29,550
"And we're just an hour away
from welcoming the new year".

34
00:08:29,649 --> 00:08:33,028
"So have lots of fun
if you've money to burn".

35
00:08:33,086 --> 00:08:35,896
"Whether it's the intoxication
of someone's eyes or the booze".

36
00:08:35,956 --> 00:08:37,060
"So let's listen".

37
00:08:37,123 --> 00:08:40,263
"And this year's number one
song is from the film 'Yaariyaan'".

38
00:08:40,327 --> 00:08:43,308
"The water's blue today.."

39
00:08:43,363 --> 00:08:46,936
"Do you want to know
why you're always stressed?"

40
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,238
"Why are you always scared".

41
00:08:48,301 --> 00:08:50,042
"That you're heading
for a disaster".

42
00:08:50,637 --> 00:08:52,947
"Do you want to move ahead in life?"

43
00:08:53,106 --> 00:08:55,916
"But there's something
that's pulling you back".

44
00:08:56,309 --> 00:08:59,256
"Why does the mind always
keep making future plans?"

45
00:08:59,479 --> 00:09:02,221
"The answer to all your
questions is in Daku Maharaj's.."

46
00:09:07,354 --> 00:09:10,301
"Stupefied."

47
00:09:11,024 --> 00:09:12,560
"Stupefied."

48
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,367
"The pany's completely stupefied."

49
00:09:15,428 --> 00:09:17,066
"There's a stir all around."

50
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:19,076
"The pany's completely stupefied."

51
00:09:19,132 --> 00:09:20,702
"There's a stir all around."

52
00:09:21,001 --> 00:09:22,605
"We're not afraid of dial-100."

53
00:09:22,669 --> 00:09:24,444
"We're already made arrangements."

54
00:09:24,671 --> 00:09:28,050
The world's astonished
by our philosophy, because.

55
00:09:28,108 --> 00:09:29,917
"We are drunk."

56
00:09:29,976 --> 00:09:31,455
"We're going to make mistakes."

57
00:09:31,644 --> 00:09:33,282
"We are drunk."

58
00:09:33,513 --> 00:09:35,151
"We're going to make mistakes."

59
00:09:35,315 --> 00:09:37,124
"We are drunk."

60
00:09:37,183 --> 00:09:38,389
"We're going to make mistakes."

61
00:09:38,451 --> 00:09:39,259
"Because."

62
00:09:39,953 --> 00:09:40,988
"Stupefied."

63
00:09:41,521 --> 00:09:42,659
"Stupefied."

64
00:09:43,356 --> 00:09:44,528
"Stupefied."

65
00:09:45,191 --> 00:09:47,034
Come on.
- Come on let's go.

66
00:09:47,127 --> 00:09:48,401
"Stupefied."

67
00:09:48,728 --> 00:09:50,002
"Stupefied."

68
00:09:50,597 --> 00:09:51,632
"Stupefied."

69
00:09:53,533 --> 00:09:56,742
"We've always been a bad kid."

70
00:09:57,037 --> 00:10:00,484
Our family says we're
pampered kids.

71
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:04,147
We've brought bottles to drink,
yet we're cautious.

72
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:07,657
Because alcohol is
injurious to healthy.

73
00:10:07,714 --> 00:10:09,489
"The pany's completely stupefied."

74
00:10:09,549 --> 00:10:11,324
"There's a stir all around."

75
00:10:11,384 --> 00:10:13,125
"We're not afraid of dial-100."

76
00:10:13,186 --> 00:10:14,995
"We're already made arrangements."

77
00:10:15,188 --> 00:10:18,499
The world's astonished
by our philosophy, because.

78
00:10:18,691 --> 00:10:22,002
The world's astonished
by our philosophy, because.

79
00:10:23,129 --> 00:10:26,042
"Stupefied."

80
00:10:26,633 --> 00:10:29,341
"Stupefied."

81
00:10:29,402 --> 00:10:31,040
"We are drunk."

82
00:10:31,271 --> 00:10:33,012
"We're going to make mistakes."

83
00:10:33,073 --> 00:10:34,575
"We are drunk."

84
00:10:34,707 --> 00:10:36,345
"We're going to make mistakes."

85
00:10:36,409 --> 00:10:38,389
Do it today what
you want to do tomorrow.

86
00:10:38,445 --> 00:10:40,049
"Do it now and not later."

87
00:10:40,113 --> 00:10:43,720
It's nightfall si

y..when
are you going to booze?

88
00:10:43,783 --> 00:10:46,764
You haven't spared a single club.
"Everyone knows you now."

89
00:10:47,087 --> 00:10:50,466
She drinks all the
alcohol that you order.

90
00:10:50,523 --> 00:10:53,003
She gets drunk and
dances shaking her waist.

91
00:10:53,059 --> 00:10:54,538
Wearing glares
even inside the club.

92
00:10:54,594 --> 00:10:56,198
"Making excuses at her home."

93
00:10:56,262 --> 00:10:58,242
That I'm going to stay
over at my friend's place tonight.

94
00:10:58,298 --> 00:10:59,800
I'll give you whiskey.
I'll give you vodka.

95
00:11:00,033 --> 00:11:01,637
I'll give you tequila
and make you lick the lime.

96
00:11:01,735 --> 00:11:03,408
"Make me yours tonight."

97
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:05,006
And I'll give you
necklace in the morning.

98
00:11:05,071 --> 00:11:07,244
Because.
"We are drunk."

99
00:11:07,307 --> 00:11:09,014
"We're going to make mistakes."

100
00:11:09,075 --> 00:11:10,611
"We are drunk."

101
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:12,280
"We're going to make mistakes."

102
00:11:13,513 --> 00:11:16,153
"Stupefied."

103
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:19,323
"Stupefied."

104
00:11:20,086 --> 00:11:23,397
The world's wrong and
we're right.

105
00:11:23,456 --> 00:11:26,835
"We never listen to
anyonebecause we're stubborn".

106
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:30,200
It's futile to stop us..
we love our music loud."

107
00:11:30,296 --> 00:11:34,210
And our feet are ready
to shake a leg today.

108
00:11:34,267 --> 00:11:36,042
"The pany's completely stupefied."

109
00:11:36,136 --> 00:11:37,774
"There's a stir all around."

110
00:11:38,037 --> 00:11:39,539
"We're not afraid of dial-100."

111
00:11:39,606 --> 00:11:41,415
"We're already made arrangements."

112
00:11:41,608 --> 00:11:45,078
The world's astonished
by our philosophy, because.

113
00:11:45,145 --> 00:11:48,592
The world's astonished
by our philosophy, because.

114
00:11:48,648 --> 00:11:50,252
"We are drunk."

115
00:11:50,483 --> 00:11:52,224
"We're going to make mistakes."

116
00:11:52,285 --> 00:11:53,730
"We are drunk."

117
00:11:54,053 --> 00:11:55,726
"We're going to make mistakes."

118
00:11:55,788 --> 00:11:57,563
"We are drunk."

119
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:59,397
"We're going to make mistakes."

120
00:11:59,459 --> 00:12:01,166
"We are drunk."

121
00:12:01,261 --> 00:12:02,763
"We're going to make mistakes."

122
00:12:04,063 --> 00:12:06,543
"Stupefied."

123
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,138
"Stupefied."

124
00:12:10,436 --> 00:12:16,387
You want promotion? - No.. no..

125
00:12:16,576 --> 00:12:17,816
No!

126
00:12:26,052 --> 00:12:27,395
WOW!

127
00:12:27,453 --> 00:12:29,592
Son, you didn't tell
me you bought a new house.

128
00:12:29,656 --> 00:12:30,396
What do you mean?

129
00:12:30,456 --> 00:12:33,403
I mean.. You bought this house,
didn't you?

130
00:12:33,993 --> 00:12:35,165
No. - No, right?

131
00:12:35,295 --> 00:12:36,569
So who's going to pay the rent?

132
00:12:38,998 --> 00:12:41,342
Sorry, I was a bit
busy.. I'll send it.

133
00:12:41,401 --> 00:12:45,213
See Gangu, he lives
in my house as the owner..

134
00:12:45,271 --> 00:12:49,413
And I've to come
up to him as the tenant.

135
00:12:49,642 --> 00:12:50,985
Absolutely right.

136
00:12:51,344 --> 00:12:53,415
He couldn't even sleep
last night because of you.

137
00:12:53,513 --> 00:12:55,117
You were making such a noise.

138
00:12:56,149 --> 00:12:57,025
How do you know?

139
00:12:59,085 --> 00:13:00,428
How does she know..

140
00:13:00,587 --> 00:13:02,157
Who can sleep with all that noise?

141
00:13:03,523 --> 00:13:04,365
Sorry.

142
00:13:05,225 --> 00:13:07,603
Listen to me, son.

143
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,469
Listen to me..

144
00:13:09,963 --> 00:13:11,237
The situation at the
office is really tensed.

145
00:13:11,297 --> 00:13:13,174
If I get this contract,
I'll go to America.

146
00:13:13,233 --> 00:13:15,076
And bring lot of gifts for you.

147
00:13:15,335 --> 00:13:17,337
Where are you going, son?
I am right here.

148
00:13:18,504 --> 00:13:21,542
Son listen to me.

149
00:13:22,141 --> 00:13:24,519
Take me along too.
Stop.

150
00:13:24,611 --> 00:13:26,284
Stupid boy.
Son..

151
00:14:13,393 --> 00:14:14,838
Good morning, Aakash sir.
- Good morning.

152
00:14:14,894 --> 00:14:16,965
Akash. Where were you?

153
00:14:18,031 --> 00:14:19,339
Boss has been waiting for you.

154
00:14:20,266 --> 00:14:21,506
Go, go, go.

155
00:14:22,902 --> 00:14:23,903
Good morning, sir.

156
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:25,916
Congratulations.
Come, come.

157
00:14:25,972 --> 00:14:29,181
Did Pablo give the order, sir?
- Not yet.

158
00:14:29,309 --> 00:14:30,879
Then why congratulations?

159
00:14:30,943 --> 00:14:34,083
You know there are
two kinds of people. - Yes.

160
00:14:34,147 --> 00:14:37,287
Those who earn first
and then party.

161
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:40,387
And then there are
those who first party.

162
00:14:40,453 --> 00:14:43,400
And then slog like
a donkey to pay the bills.

163
00:14:44,023 --> 00:14:46,503
Now do you know which
category you belong to?

164
00:14:47,393 --> 00:14:48,201
Sorry, sir.

165
00:14:48,828 --> 00:14:51,331
You haven't been promoted yet.
but soon you will.

166
00:14:52,365 --> 00:14:56,006
But do you know what
Shakspeare has said.

167
00:14:56,069 --> 00:15:00,518
There are many a lips
between slips and cup.

168
00:15:00,873 --> 00:15:01,544
Right, sir.

169
00:15:02,241 --> 00:15:03,515
Get out.
- Okay sir.

170
00:15:03,576 --> 00:15:04,350
Out!

171
00:15:07,213 --> 00:15:10,490
Right now Pablo's contract
is really important.

172
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:12,357
Otherwise, I'll be spending
the rest of my life..

173
00:15:12,418 --> 00:15:13,863
In the same office,
on the same post.

174
00:15:13,987 --> 00:15:15,330
So true.

175
00:15:15,488 --> 00:15:17,468
I bought a new phone. - Wow.

176
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:21,599
Akash sir, if you don't
mind can I take a selfie with you?

177
00:15:23,563 --> 00:15:25,008
Yeah! - Thank you, sir.

178
00:15:25,064 --> 00:15:26,634
I'll put this on Whatsapp display.

179
00:15:26,866 --> 00:15:29,210
Look at how happy he is.

180
00:15:29,369 --> 00:15:31,007
Spending the rest of
your life in the same office.

181
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:32,913
And on the same
post is not that bad.

182
00:15:33,172 --> 00:15:34,480
We just have to learn to be happy.

183
00:15:40,546 --> 00:15:41,490
One second.

184
00:15:42,148 --> 00:15:43,286
Everyone's taking a selfie.

185
00:15:43,349 --> 00:15:44,953
It's a mobile revolution.

186
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:52,226
Yes, mom.

187
00:15:52,992 --> 00:15:56,132
I was wondering it's been
really long since I last saw you.

188
00:15:56,329 --> 00:15:58,240
Yes, mom.
I'll come home during Diwali.

189
00:15:58,664 --> 00:16:00,337
I've spent many Diwalis without you.

190
00:16:00,433 --> 00:16:02,379
I am in the office.

191
00:16:03,302 --> 00:16:05,646
We need to finalize
the deal on the studio.

192
00:16:05,705 --> 00:16:08,015
Which is on you and
your Grandfather's name.

193
00:16:08,274 --> 00:16:11,380
And these days grandpa
hasn't been keeping well.

194
00:16:11,444 --> 00:16:14,687
So if you could come home..
- Yes, mom.

195
00:16:57,023 --> 00:16:59,902
"There are some people whom we
greet with a smile for no reason".

196
00:17:00,026 --> 00:17:03,974
"And there are some people
who make us smile when we meet".

197
00:17:09,969 --> 00:17:14,509
"There are some people that
knock on the doors of your heart".

198
00:17:15,074 --> 00:17:16,314
"And then there are some people".

199
00:17:16,442 --> 00:17:19,787
"Who climb in threw the
window when the door's closed".

200
00:17:24,784 --> 00:17:26,923
"That's how she was..
and I was like this".

201
00:17:27,353 --> 00:17:29,560
"She was always happy, and me.."

202
00:17:30,123 --> 00:17:31,830
"Always in pursuit of happiness".

203
00:17:33,459 --> 00:17:36,099
"The happiness I kept
pursuing all my life.."

204
00:17:36,395 --> 00:17:38,466
"Lay right under her eye-lids".

205
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,136
"It's so strange."

206
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:46,006
"Some lanes and houses
are like memories".

207
00:17:46,506 --> 00:17:48,952
"No matter how far ahead we go.."

208
00:17:50,209 --> 00:17:52,280
"It brings us back in a moment".

209
00:18:04,991 --> 00:18:06,197
Grandpa.

210
00:18:17,236 --> 00:18:18,340
Here, have some tea.

211
00:18:20,606 --> 00:18:22,279
His memory's become weak.

212
00:18:23,009 --> 00:18:25,182
Sometimes he recognizes everyone,
and sometimes he doesn't.

213
00:18:26,412 --> 00:18:28,392
Father, it's Akku.

214
00:18:28,447 --> 00:18:29,482
Akku.

215
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:33,592
Panditji,
please tell me about my future.

216
00:18:33,886 --> 00:18:35,194
Will it be a boy or a girl?

217
00:18:35,254 --> 00:18:37,291
Bantu, you must get married first.

218
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:42,664
This city has changed
so drastically.

219
00:18:43,963 --> 00:18:44,532
Yes.

220
00:18:44,964 --> 00:18:47,001
While running in the
race of moving ahead..

221
00:18:47,066 --> 00:18:48,443
The city is completely tired.

222
00:18:49,068 --> 00:18:51,309
All the young kids have left.

223
00:18:51,504 --> 00:18:53,950
They went to Mumbai,
Delhi, in search of jobs.

224
00:18:54,073 --> 00:18:56,246
Only this Bantu stayed
loyal to this place.

225
00:18:56,509 --> 00:18:57,579
Why do I want to anywhere?

226
00:18:58,077 --> 00:19:00,182
I had a hard time finding
a buyer for the studio.

227
00:19:00,246 --> 00:19:04,023
Let's just sell it this
time if he really wants to.

228
00:19:04,884 --> 00:19:07,922
And we'll also rent
out his room out.

229
00:19:16,362 --> 00:19:17,306
Smile!

230
00:19:22,401 --> 00:19:24,074
Don’t worry at all.

231
00:19:24,604 --> 00:19:27,278
Consider this deal
of your studio fixed.

232
00:19:28,107 --> 00:19:30,485
Just get your grandfatheﬁs
thumb-impression on this agreement.

233
00:20:25,998 --> 00:20:27,341
Here you go, Mr. Nagaliya.

234
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:29,244
Your passpon size photos.

235
00:20:29,402 --> 00:20:31,313
There are eight copies.
- Thank you.

236
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,241
Grandpa!

237
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:42,120
Grandpa! - Naughty boy.
Mischievous chap.

238
00:20:56,495 --> 00:21:02,468
Hello. Hello.

239
00:21:02,535 --> 00:21:05,778
For the first time
in Tanakpunadult film.

240
00:21:05,838 --> 00:21:08,444
‘Qatil Haseena..
Husn Ki Daaku.‘

241
00:21:08,507 --> 00:21:11,886
Small charades like
a bowl of sweet-porride.

242
00:21:11,944 --> 00:21:14,220
Don't let them slip
out of your hands.

243
00:21:15,281 --> 00:21:18,558
Let's slowly,gradually open
the windows of bliss.

244
00:21:18,784 --> 00:21:21,287
"And let the breeze come in."

245
00:21:22,054 --> 00:21:25,263
"Tip-toe and come to me.."

246
00:21:25,324 --> 00:21:27,395
"These moments won't
come back again".

247
00:21:27,827 --> 00:21:34,244
"What else is this life."

248
00:21:34,467 --> 00:21:39,280
"It's a joke so please smile."

249
00:21:39,338 --> 00:21:42,080
"Don't be sad. Why are you sad?"

250
00:21:42,141 --> 00:21:45,384
Small charades like
a bowl of sweet-porridge.

251
00:21:45,444 --> 00:21:48,118
Don't let them slip
out of your hands.

252
00:21:48,881 --> 00:21:52,124
Let's slowly, gradually
open the windows of bliss.

253
00:21:52,184 --> 00:21:54,994
"And let the breeze come in."

254
00:21:58,190 --> 00:21:59,328
The queen's here.

255
00:22:00,226 --> 00:22:01,330
Careful.

256
00:22:02,094 --> 00:22:06,065
Let's be bold,
Let's be sneaky today.

257
00:22:09,235 --> 00:22:11,078
My stomacHs aching.

258
00:22:11,303 --> 00:22:14,614
His milk isn't good something's
definitely wrong.

259
00:22:14,974 --> 00:22:16,817
My stomach!

260
00:22:17,209 --> 00:22:20,088
"Let's steal something away."

261
00:22:22,214 --> 00:22:26,856
Let's fill our bags with innocent,
and I've memories.

262
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:34,335
"What else is this life."

263
00:22:34,827 --> 00:22:39,435
"It's a joke so please smile."

264
00:22:39,498 --> 00:22:42,206
"Don't be sad. Why are you sad?"

265
00:22:42,268 --> 00:22:45,545
Small charades like
a bowl of sweet-porride.

266
00:22:45,604 --> 00:22:48,278
Don't let them slip
out of your hands.

267
00:22:50,009 --> 00:22:51,079
Smile.

268
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:52,450
Smile.

269
00:23:02,955 --> 00:23:03,956
Smile.

270
00:23:06,258 --> 00:23:07,328
Smile.

271
00:23:08,461 --> 00:23:09,599
Smile.

272
00:23:10,496 --> 00:23:12,840
Smile. Smile.

273
00:23:17,236 --> 00:23:21,116
Grandpa,
you even got that Shakku married?

274
00:23:21,173 --> 00:23:23,016
Will there be anyone left for me?

275
00:23:26,312 --> 00:23:30,886
Grandpa, does everyone get married?
- Yes, Grandson.

276
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:32,451
And you will too.

277
00:23:33,052 --> 00:23:35,555
Like I did your father did.

278
00:23:36,222 --> 00:23:38,202
We take many births.

279
00:23:38,557 --> 00:23:40,366
Sometimes as husband and wife.

280
00:23:40,526 --> 00:23:41,903
Sometimes as lovers.

281
00:23:42,061 --> 00:23:43,438
And sometimes even as strangers.

282
00:23:43,863 --> 00:23:45,365
But in the end we do meet.

283
00:23:46,198 --> 00:23:48,644
If we don't, the story won't end.

284
00:23:48,968 --> 00:23:50,879
You predict everyone's
future, grandpa..

285
00:23:50,936 --> 00:23:52,142
Please tell me my future as well.

286
00:23:53,005 --> 00:23:54,143
I see..

287
00:23:55,274 --> 00:23:56,218
Fine.

288
00:24:13,125 --> 00:24:14,103
What happened, grandpa?

289
00:24:14,393 --> 00:24:16,566
Tell me when I'll meet her.. Tell me.

290
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:17,931
Right here..

291
00:24:19,165 --> 00:24:20,166
In this city.

292
00:24:20,232 --> 00:24:22,041
Really? - Yes.

293
00:24:23,002 --> 00:24:28,953
500 steps from our
studio. will be her home.

294
00:24:33,212 --> 00:24:35,192
You will be with her all your life..

295
00:24:35,981 --> 00:24:37,585
But she'll never be yours.

296
00:24:42,655 --> 00:24:44,362
What is love, grandpa?

297
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:47,197
When two people touch
each other's soul.

298
00:24:47,626 --> 00:24:50,334
Meaning the inner person..

299
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:52,470
Then that's love.

300
00:24:54,099 --> 00:24:54,941
Meaning?

301
00:24:56,402 --> 00:24:58,507
Meaning, when you fall in love, son..

302
00:24:58,704 --> 00:24:59,444
Yes.

303
00:25:00,973 --> 00:25:03,579
Then even these black
clouds seem colorful.

304
00:25:04,209 --> 00:25:07,088
This black crow sounds
like a nightingale.

305
00:25:07,546 --> 00:25:10,220
Love grows like a
sapling in the rains.

306
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:13,494
The wind stans to sing songs.

307
00:25:14,053 --> 00:25:18,502
The hean says. "Keep dancing.
Keep dancing. Keep dancing. "

308
00:25:18,557 --> 00:25:20,002
"Keep dancing."

309
00:25:45,451 --> 00:25:46,555
Tell me something, grandpa.

310
00:25:46,619 --> 00:25:49,463
How will I know that
I'm in love with her?

311
00:25:49,588 --> 00:25:50,999
Your hean will tell you.

312
00:25:52,091 --> 00:25:54,093
When you pass-by her house.

313
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:57,267
Your hean will
stan beating loudly.

314
00:25:57,429 --> 00:25:59,170
Your breathing will get heavy.

315
00:25:59,465 --> 00:26:02,912
And you will know that
you're in love with her.

316
00:26:03,235 --> 00:26:04,043
I see..!

317
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:20,926
One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight, nine..

318
00:26:20,986 --> 00:26:25,298
Ten, eleven, twelve, thineen,
founeen, fifteen.

319
00:26:29,128 --> 00:26:31,039
Forty-one, forty-two.

320
00:26:36,435 --> 00:26:43,410
496.. 497.. 498.. 499..

321
00:26:43,575 --> 00:26:44,485
500!

322
00:26:48,414 --> 00:26:50,655
500 steps from our
studio.

323
00:26:53,285 --> 00:26:54,491
Will be her home.

324
00:27:32,891 --> 00:27:36,395
The number you're trying
to call is currently not reachable.

325
00:27:36,729 --> 00:27:38,174
"The number you're trying. "

326
00:27:45,771 --> 00:27:46,841
Is everything okay?

327
00:27:49,241 --> 00:27:52,518
Is everything okay, mom..
but not right.

328
00:27:52,845 --> 00:27:55,758
Nothing happened the
way I wanted in my life.

329
00:27:57,349 --> 00:27:58,453
When the time's right.

330
00:27:58,784 --> 00:28:01,264
Things will go your way,
like you expected.

331
00:28:04,356 --> 00:28:05,391
Yes.

332
00:28:10,262 --> 00:28:13,209
Did you ever meet her again?

333
00:29:03,649 --> 00:29:08,325
"What can this hean tell you?"

334
00:29:08,787 --> 00:29:13,668
"How much I love you."

335
00:29:13,892 --> 00:29:18,932
"I can write it down with my tears."

336
00:29:18,997 --> 00:29:23,912
"So no one can read it without me."

337
00:29:29,308 --> 00:29:34,121
I'll stay quiet and
not utter a single word.

338
00:29:34,379 --> 00:29:39,294
"And sleep for ages to come."

339
00:29:39,718 --> 00:29:44,718
The eyes you dwell in..
I will never open that eyes.

340
00:29:49,995 --> 00:29:54,967
"Dwell in my heart."

341
00:29:55,167 --> 00:30:00,241
"Take my soul out of my body."

342
00:30:12,451 --> 00:30:15,330
Every day, every night.
I think about you.

343
00:30:16,455 --> 00:30:20,164
Every moment, every time. Only
one question dwells in my mind.

344
00:30:20,959 --> 00:30:22,802
How do I live without you?

345
00:30:23,195 --> 00:30:25,402
How do I live without you?

346
00:30:25,998 --> 00:30:29,343
As you smiled. the stars shied away.

347
00:30:29,701 --> 00:30:33,205
As the hean beats rose..
It scared me.

348
00:30:34,239 --> 00:30:38,210
O breeze, blowing
breeze touch her gently.

349
00:30:38,277 --> 00:30:41,986
Give her the message
of my love secretly..

350
00:30:42,181 --> 00:30:43,182
And closely.

351
00:30:43,815 --> 00:30:44,759
I love you.

352
00:30:49,187 --> 00:30:49,961
What happened?

353
00:30:50,222 --> 00:30:51,132
Didn't you like it?

354
00:30:51,757 --> 00:30:52,531
It's nice.

355
00:30:52,891 --> 00:30:56,031
The last line was sudden.

356
00:30:56,261 --> 00:30:58,502
Fine, now you show me.
What did you write?

357
00:30:59,264 --> 00:31:01,335
When the time comes. - Show me.

358
00:31:01,767 --> 00:31:02,472
Not yet.

359
00:31:03,435 --> 00:31:04,880
Fine, forget it. Don't show me.

360
00:31:06,071 --> 00:31:08,210
Tell me, Which sari
will you wear tomorrow...

361
00:31:08,273 --> 00:31:09,911
For the farewell party?

362
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:12,821
Whichever my mom gives.

363
00:31:12,911 --> 00:31:13,855
And blouse?

364
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:17,356
Why do I tell you?
- Will your mom's blouse fit you?

365
00:31:19,851 --> 00:31:22,195
Listen we'll meet
here tomorrow at 6pm.

366
00:31:22,354 --> 00:31:23,765
And leave for the function together.

367
00:31:23,889 --> 00:31:24,924
Okay? - Okay.

368
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:27,333
Promise. - Promise.

369
00:31:27,526 --> 00:31:30,564
And we'll also bring a
panner plant for Ashu tomorrow.

370
00:31:30,896 --> 00:31:32,534
So that he doesn't feel lonely, ever.

371
00:31:39,237 --> 00:31:40,614
Listen.

372
00:31:42,407 --> 00:31:44,614
Brother, there's a huge difference.

373
00:31:44,676 --> 00:31:47,555
Between the colleges
here and in Mumbai.

374
00:31:47,779 --> 00:31:49,816
Think about my nephew's future.

375
00:31:50,148 --> 00:31:52,526
He can progress there, not here.

376
00:31:57,823 --> 00:32:01,737
My grandfather used to say..

377
00:32:02,427 --> 00:32:04,373
If you want to see your home prosper.

378
00:32:05,264 --> 00:32:06,607
Then you should live there.

379
00:32:08,266 --> 00:32:11,304
When someone goes to the
city. The city will prosper.

380
00:32:12,571 --> 00:32:15,142
But the homes get desened.

381
00:32:16,074 --> 00:32:19,180
I took quite an effon
to arrange for his admission.

382
00:32:19,645 --> 00:32:21,488
This opponunity won't come again.

383
00:32:21,847 --> 00:32:23,258
We have only one son.

384
00:32:23,582 --> 00:32:25,255
If he's your only son..

385
00:32:25,317 --> 00:32:27,797
Then let him take
decisions of his life.

386
00:32:30,756 --> 00:32:33,566
Only one hour left
for the train to leave.

387
00:32:34,126 --> 00:32:35,799
Quickly decide what to do.

388
00:32:36,795 --> 00:32:38,832
And in order to do something in life..

389
00:32:39,297 --> 00:32:41,436
One has to make few sacrifices.

390
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,314
Won't you tell her?

391
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:30,651
What if she stops me?

392
00:33:43,895 --> 00:33:47,968
"You're now my sweetheart"

393
00:33:48,033 --> 00:33:51,981
"You showered me with your grace."

394
00:33:52,037 --> 00:33:56,179
"You're now my sweetheart"

395
00:33:56,241 --> 00:34:00,246
"You showered me with your grace."

396
00:34:01,913 --> 00:34:05,656
My small city.. Which I
left behind in a small moment.

397
00:34:06,418 --> 00:34:08,489
And her too.

398
00:34:09,354 --> 00:34:11,630
Maybe this is why cities are so noisy.

399
00:34:12,591 --> 00:34:14,935
So that you can't
listen to your heart.

400
00:34:15,927 --> 00:34:16,997
I couldn't either.

401
00:34:17,996 --> 00:34:19,407
And honestly speaking.

402
00:34:19,464 --> 00:34:22,274
After a while I didn't want to.

403
00:34:34,312 --> 00:34:37,259
'When you pass-by her house..'

404
00:34:37,315 --> 00:34:39,386
'Your hean will
stan beating loudly'.

405
00:35:02,073 --> 00:35:02,608
Tea.

406
00:35:09,114 --> 00:35:10,092
Listen. - Yes.

407
00:35:11,349 --> 00:35:16,697
Does grandpa's prediction
always come true?

408
00:35:17,422 --> 00:35:22,770
Well it's come true
for those who believed it.

409
00:35:23,862 --> 00:35:25,273
I don't know about the rest.

410
00:35:40,378 --> 00:35:41,618
Here's 1.5 million rupees.

411
00:35:42,247 --> 00:35:43,419
Full payment for this studio.

412
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:47,621
We thought when you
return from the city..

413
00:35:48,587 --> 00:35:50,567
You will keep your
promise you made to father.

414
00:35:51,423 --> 00:35:52,595
And take care of this studio.

415
00:35:54,659 --> 00:35:56,138
If that had happened..

416
00:35:56,528 --> 00:35:58,474
We would've never sold this studio.

417
00:35:59,664 --> 00:36:02,167
You shattered all our dreams.

418
00:36:03,702 --> 00:36:06,444
Don't you have anything
in your hean for this city?

419
00:36:07,506 --> 00:36:09,486
Papa, who runs a photo studio.

420
00:36:09,541 --> 00:36:11,350
In this age of mobile phones?

421
00:36:23,888 --> 00:36:24,798
Akku.

422
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:26,400
Grandpa.

423
00:36:28,026 --> 00:36:30,199
Grandpa, your Akku.

424
00:36:31,363 --> 00:36:32,808
Your Akku, grandpa.

425
00:36:35,066 --> 00:36:35,976
Grandpa..

426
00:36:38,336 --> 00:36:39,280
Grandpa..

427
00:36:40,272 --> 00:36:42,149
Grandpa..

428
00:36:43,975 --> 00:36:45,045
Grandpa..

429
00:36:52,117 --> 00:36:54,097
Sir. - You're the sir.

430
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:56,493
I am your servant.

431
00:36:56,922 --> 00:36:58,196
Where are you, mister? - Sir, I..

432
00:36:58,290 --> 00:36:59,564
Where the hell have you been?

433
00:37:00,926 --> 00:37:03,964
I've been trying to
reach you since 4 days.

434
00:37:04,129 --> 00:37:05,073
Where are you?

435
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:06,641
Actually, there's a signal.. - No..

436
00:37:06,865 --> 00:37:09,106
Soon you'll be standing
at the signals.

437
00:37:10,035 --> 00:37:12,072
You're fired. - Sir.

438
00:37:12,237 --> 00:37:13,272
Hello.

439
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:15,546
Hello. Hello.

440
00:37:20,212 --> 00:37:21,247
Where are you going?

441
00:37:21,479 --> 00:37:22,958
We can't complete this deal now.

442
00:37:23,014 --> 00:37:24,152
I've got an emergency.

443
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:33,867
I'm fired!

444
00:37:34,993 --> 00:37:38,031
Not just you, even our boss is fired.

445
00:37:40,365 --> 00:37:41,366
Meaning.

446
00:37:42,033 --> 00:37:44,912
That Pablo from US got divorced.

447
00:37:45,337 --> 00:37:47,442
And the company went to his wife.

448
00:37:47,605 --> 00:37:49,141
Order cancelled? - Yes.

449
00:37:49,474 --> 00:37:52,148
Bloody Pablo. He had every1hing.

450
00:37:52,444 --> 00:37:55,220
And suddenly. All over.

451
00:37:56,548 --> 00:37:57,526
How?

452
00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:00,696
His wife found out that,
after working hours..

453
00:38:00,919 --> 00:38:03,160
Pablo used to do
his secretary every day.

454
00:38:04,656 --> 00:38:05,566
Not flowers.

455
00:38:07,692 --> 00:38:10,536
Then what. the wife took
his company as settlement.

456
00:38:11,196 --> 00:38:14,143
There must be some way..

457
00:38:14,199 --> 00:38:17,043
I've to talk to the boss
and get this contract back.

458
00:38:17,202 --> 00:38:19,478
Yes, but the boss
isn't talking to anyone.

459
00:38:21,106 --> 00:38:22,107
There's one way.

460
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:26,115
Sir!

461
00:38:26,711 --> 00:38:28,281
Please, sir. I want to talk to you.

462
00:38:29,714 --> 00:38:31,022
Please, sir. - Get out.

463
00:38:31,149 --> 00:38:33,459
No, sir. I've done
enough for this company.

464
00:38:33,518 --> 00:38:34,963
Now let me do it.

465
00:38:35,453 --> 00:38:38,662
Sir, I only want seven days. - No!

466
00:38:38,924 --> 00:38:40,198
Give it, sir. Please.

467
00:38:40,492 --> 00:38:42,233
Get out!
Get out!

468
00:38:43,528 --> 00:38:46,407
Please, sir. - What's the guarantee?

469
00:38:46,965 --> 00:38:49,707
Sir, even life has no guarantee.
but we don't stop living.

470
00:38:51,303 --> 00:38:56,719
Look if you can't bring
this contract back in seven days..

471
00:38:57,175 --> 00:38:58,313
Then don't show your face here.

472
00:39:01,179 --> 00:39:02,021
Done, sir.

473
00:39:05,016 --> 00:39:06,051
I am also done.

474
00:39:11,356 --> 00:39:13,165
Really appreciate that.
Yeah, thank you.

475
00:39:14,192 --> 00:39:15,796
Wow you're really lucky.

476
00:39:16,428 --> 00:39:18,101
I've found the where abouts
of Mrs. Pablo. - What?

477
00:39:18,696 --> 00:39:21,176
She's visiting some
strange yoga camp in Canada.

478
00:39:21,299 --> 00:39:22,277
That worries me.

479
00:39:22,667 --> 00:39:24,146
When she's forsaken all
delusions and worldly ties..

480
00:39:24,202 --> 00:39:27,513
And joined some yoga camp..how
can she give you business contract.

481
00:39:31,443 --> 00:39:33,354
I will do what I have to.

482
00:39:33,678 --> 00:39:35,624
But I will get this contract.

483
00:39:45,056 --> 00:39:46,626
Welcome. Greetings.

484
00:39:46,858 --> 00:39:47,996
Greetings.

485
00:39:50,261 --> 00:39:52,537
Welcome. Stan Live.

486
00:39:53,965 --> 00:39:54,875
Thank you.

487
00:39:55,033 --> 00:39:56,011
Thank you.

488
00:39:56,367 --> 00:39:58,244
Wow. - What?

489
00:39:58,436 --> 00:39:59,346
Your smile.

490
00:40:00,238 --> 00:40:01,683
You get a dimple as well.

491
00:40:02,373 --> 00:40:03,317
Lovely.

492
00:40:04,175 --> 00:40:07,349
So Ms. Pooja,
will you do me a favor please?

493
00:40:07,979 --> 00:40:10,050
I am looking out for Ms.
Pablo.. - Okay.

494
00:40:10,115 --> 00:40:11,025
She's a good friend of mine.

495
00:40:11,082 --> 00:40:13,460
Could you please let
me know where I can find her?

496
00:40:13,652 --> 00:40:15,928
Let me try, sir. - Thank you.

497
00:40:16,221 --> 00:40:17,529
I don't want to listen to you.

498
00:40:18,256 --> 00:40:19,360
Hello madam. - Hello.

499
00:40:19,424 --> 00:40:20,198
Madam. - Yes.

500
00:40:20,258 --> 00:40:22,670
Isn't there a rule,
that as soon as you enter the camp..

501
00:40:22,894 --> 00:40:24,464
Then we must change our name?

502
00:40:24,529 --> 00:40:25,234
Right? - Of course.

503
00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:26,240
See.

504
00:40:26,464 --> 00:40:28,000
When our old sins are purified..

505
00:40:28,066 --> 00:40:29,306
Only then can we do new deeds.

506
00:40:29,467 --> 00:40:32,107
And on top of that I
gave you such an amazing name.

507
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:33,444
Fakirchand. - I don't care.

508
00:40:33,705 --> 00:40:36,914
Whatever happens, I am not
going to call myself Fakirchand.

509
00:40:37,108 --> 00:40:40,282
I want to be Bond. James Bond.
- Okay.

510
00:40:40,345 --> 00:40:42,518
Wow! Nice name.

511
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,682
Write down my name Rekha.

512
00:40:44,916 --> 00:40:46,953
And my name's Kejriwal.

513
00:40:47,018 --> 00:40:48,463
Write his name as Kejriwal uncle.

514
00:40:48,586 --> 00:40:50,964
Mrs. Pablo is in room no..
- Sorry sir.

515
00:40:51,356 --> 00:40:54,303
We cannot release
any personal details.

516
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:57,006
But ma'am, I really..
- Camp Policy.

517
00:40:58,263 --> 00:40:59,333
Camp Policy?

518
00:40:59,531 --> 00:41:02,011
By the way, have you thought
of a name for yourself?

519
00:41:02,967 --> 00:41:03,604
Name?

520
00:41:04,736 --> 00:41:06,215
Keep your name Bill.

521
00:41:06,271 --> 00:41:07,147
Bill gates.

522
00:41:07,338 --> 00:41:09,181
Suits you Bro.
- Bill.

523
00:41:10,108 --> 00:41:12,019
Myself Bond. James Bond.

524
00:41:12,477 --> 00:41:13,683
Hey, Bond.

525
00:41:14,279 --> 00:41:16,316
Hey, buddy. Can you do me a favor?

526
00:41:16,381 --> 00:41:17,587
Sure, what's it bro?

527
00:41:28,393 --> 00:41:31,465
Are you Mrs. Pablo?
- I hate men.

528
00:41:31,529 --> 00:41:32,439
Me too.

529
00:41:37,669 --> 00:41:39,080
Are you Mrs. Pablo?

530
00:41:40,171 --> 00:41:41,013
No.

531
00:41:41,539 --> 00:41:43,576
Excuse me. Hello.

532
00:41:44,142 --> 00:41:48,591
Hey, are you Mrs. Pablo?
- No. but I can be for you.

533
00:41:50,715 --> 00:41:53,286
Bro, you've never seen Mrs. Pablo.

534
00:41:53,451 --> 00:41:55,158
And now you're looking for her..

535
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:57,461
In a place where everyone's
changed their name.

536
00:41:57,622 --> 00:41:59,101
Maybe this is impossible.

537
00:41:59,157 --> 00:42:00,568
Have to do it, bro.

538
00:42:00,625 --> 00:42:02,229
Otherwise I am..

539
00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:12,505
Excuse me.

540
00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:14,516
Is your real name Mrs. Pablo?

541
00:42:14,572 --> 00:42:16,677
Get lost or I will smack you.

542
00:42:20,278 --> 00:42:22,758
All I ask whether she's Mrs.
Pablo or not?

543
00:42:24,082 --> 00:42:26,995
Who's asking? - Not me.

544
00:42:27,285 --> 00:42:28,355
I didn't do any1hing.

545
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,666
Him.
He's asking.

546
00:42:43,167 --> 00:42:46,171
Hi, I am Bill. For this place.

547
00:42:46,738 --> 00:42:48,684
Actually Akash.

548
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:50,175
Akankshah.

549
00:42:50,308 --> 00:42:52,310
I used to be Mrs. Pablo.

550
00:42:53,011 --> 00:42:53,716
WOW!

551
00:42:56,681 --> 00:42:59,252
I didn't know..
Mr. Pablo's ex is $0..

552
00:43:00,518 --> 00:43:03,158
So? - So beautiful.

553
00:43:04,188 --> 00:43:05,292
Oh please.

554
00:43:07,825 --> 00:43:09,600
No, really. Listen to me.

555
00:43:10,228 --> 00:43:12,606
Come on, we just met.

556
00:43:13,264 --> 00:43:14,709
Have you heard about
love at first sight?

557
00:43:15,133 --> 00:43:17,204
Tried it. Didn't work out.

558
00:43:17,468 --> 00:43:19,846
But mine's working out. Now.

559
00:43:21,306 --> 00:43:23,718
What a faker.

560
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:37,365
Om! Om!

561
00:43:37,488 --> 00:43:40,094
With great sorrow
I am telling all of you..

562
00:43:40,625 --> 00:43:42,798
That Baba's got constipation.

563
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:45,101
He won't be able
to take today's session.

564
00:43:45,496 --> 00:43:48,409
In his absence,
I will be taking this session.

565
00:43:48,533 --> 00:43:49,568
So today.

566
00:43:49,767 --> 00:43:51,474
Babyji. - Rocks!

567
00:43:51,602 --> 00:43:53,240
Babyji. - Rocks!

568
00:43:53,304 --> 00:43:55,306
I would like to tell you..

569
00:43:55,607 --> 00:43:59,384
That two years ago
I used to be sex-addict.

570
00:44:00,178 --> 00:44:01,851
But thanks to Baba's blessings.

571
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:04,526
Now I am a clean soul.

572
00:44:05,216 --> 00:44:08,789
Baba says that we
take binh many times.

573
00:44:09,387 --> 00:44:10,365
To do..

574
00:44:13,257 --> 00:44:14,463
Good deeds.

575
00:44:15,026 --> 00:44:15,970
Good deeds.

576
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:20,502
Baba says we're a ﬂock of 200 souls.

577
00:44:20,698 --> 00:44:22,939
And one of them is our soul-mate.

578
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:28,048
And this ﬂock of 200 souls
keep taking binh again and again.

579
00:44:28,206 --> 00:44:30,447
Sometimes they are our soul mate.

580
00:44:31,008 --> 00:44:33,113
Sometimes they are our wife.

581
00:44:33,378 --> 00:44:36,154
And sometimes they are our lover.

582
00:44:36,481 --> 00:44:38,051
So lesson of the day..

583
00:44:38,316 --> 00:44:42,025
Patience plus peace equal to Love.

584
00:44:43,688 --> 00:44:46,168
See you later alligator.

585
00:44:46,591 --> 00:44:48,366
Babyji. - Rocks!

586
00:44:48,493 --> 00:44:50,063
Babyji. - Rocks!

587
00:44:53,064 --> 00:44:54,042
You know..

588
00:44:55,366 --> 00:44:57,505
I think I've seen you before.

589
00:44:58,036 --> 00:45:00,141
I mean there's some
connection between us.

590
00:45:00,204 --> 00:45:01,979
Maybe some past-life connection?

591
00:45:04,075 --> 00:45:05,110
Maybe?

592
00:45:06,044 --> 00:45:08,115
Can I ask you a question? - Huh!

593
00:45:08,379 --> 00:45:09,653
Be honest.

594
00:45:10,014 --> 00:45:12,585
I never forgive those who lie?

595
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:17,563
What are you doing here?

596
00:45:19,023 --> 00:45:19,694
I don't know.

597
00:45:20,224 --> 00:45:21,066
Thank you.

598
00:45:22,293 --> 00:45:25,001
The hean said "the
one you're looking for.."

599
00:45:25,196 --> 00:45:27,437
"You'll find her here".

600
00:45:28,199 --> 00:45:29,371
Who are you looking for?

601
00:45:29,567 --> 00:45:34,312
One that's made for me,
and I'm for her.

602
00:45:34,706 --> 00:45:35,616
Did you find her?

603
00:45:36,307 --> 00:45:37,342
Seems like it?

604
00:45:38,042 --> 00:45:40,488
My mind says that you're lying.

605
00:45:47,485 --> 00:45:50,398
And your hean.

606
00:45:50,688 --> 00:45:53,760
My head's forbidding me
to tell you about my feelings.

607
00:45:59,230 --> 00:46:02,234
Do you believe in what Babyji said?

608
00:46:03,367 --> 00:46:04,778
Not at all. - What?

609
00:46:06,304 --> 00:46:09,649
We shouldn't doubt her at all. Babyji.

610
00:46:11,709 --> 00:46:12,847
After all..

611
00:46:14,145 --> 00:46:15,419
She's know every1hing.

612
00:46:17,615 --> 00:46:19,117
But she's a bit funny
you know.

613
00:46:19,217 --> 00:46:20,195
Since I met her..

614
00:46:20,284 --> 00:46:23,458
Her preaching sound less spiritual,
and more of lust.

615
00:46:25,089 --> 00:46:26,159
Stop it.

616
00:46:31,329 --> 00:46:32,637
You know. - What?

617
00:46:33,731 --> 00:46:35,802
When your hands are in mine..

618
00:46:36,801 --> 00:46:42,217
It's hard to tell which fingers
are yours and which are mine.

619
00:46:43,741 --> 00:46:45,220
Really? - Really.

620
00:46:49,447 --> 00:46:50,289
Goodnight!

621
00:47:23,548 --> 00:47:24,583
How dare you.

622
00:47:28,085 --> 00:47:30,827
"It's happened for the first time."

623
00:47:31,055 --> 00:47:33,763
"That I smiled like this."

624
00:47:33,824 --> 00:47:36,771
"Since I saw you.. I realized.."

625
00:47:36,828 --> 00:47:40,071
"Why I came in this world."

626
00:47:45,703 --> 00:47:48,582
"It's happened for the first time."

627
00:47:48,639 --> 00:47:51,552
"That I smiled like this."

628
00:47:51,609 --> 00:47:54,556
"Since I saw you.. I realized.."

629
00:47:54,612 --> 00:47:57,525
"Why I came in this world."

630
00:47:57,582 --> 00:48:00,495
"Giving my hean to you.."

631
00:48:00,551 --> 00:48:03,464
"I am here to live you."

632
00:48:03,521 --> 00:48:09,369
I've the permission
to love you from God.

633
00:48:33,885 --> 00:48:36,832
"From earth to the skies.."

634
00:48:36,887 --> 00:48:39,731
"I've searched the entire world."

635
00:48:39,790 --> 00:48:42,703
"But God hasn't created yet."

636
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:45,707
"Anyone as beautiful as you."

637
00:48:46,297 --> 00:48:52,270
"Your words spell mischief."

638
00:48:52,336 --> 00:48:56,648
"And you praises are meaningless."

639
00:48:56,707 --> 00:48:59,586
"I can write this on the sky.."

640
00:48:59,644 --> 00:49:02,557
"So the whole world can read it."

641
00:49:02,613 --> 00:49:08,461
There will never be anyone
here like the two of us.

642
00:49:08,519 --> 00:49:14,367
I've brought all the praises
in the world to offer you.

643
00:49:14,492 --> 00:49:20,443
I've the permission
to love you from God.

644
00:49:21,532 --> 00:49:23,239
"From God."

645
00:49:24,468 --> 00:49:26,243
"From God."

646
00:49:28,506 --> 00:49:31,146
I am a footbal which will save you..

647
00:49:31,208 --> 00:49:33,347
So that you never fall.

648
00:49:33,411 --> 00:49:36,881
Write your names on your
football and put it in that box.

649
00:49:42,253 --> 00:49:45,632
Now look for the football
that has your name.

650
00:49:46,157 --> 00:49:49,900
Who knows you might find
the person that's your soul-mate.

651
00:49:51,529 --> 00:49:53,270
Come on, come on find it.

652
00:49:53,597 --> 00:49:56,134
Calm down. Calm down.

653
00:49:58,002 --> 00:49:59,606
Take any ball..

654
00:50:00,104 --> 00:50:01,344
It can be anyone's name.

655
00:50:02,073 --> 00:50:05,350
Find the owner of
that ball in this crowd.

656
00:50:05,676 --> 00:50:06,654
Quickly.

657
00:50:29,066 --> 00:50:30,306
Anjali? - N0!

658
00:50:33,404 --> 00:50:36,681
Lisa. - Yeah, thanks.

659
00:50:46,350 --> 00:50:49,331
Excuse me, are you Bill?
- No. That's him.

660
00:50:50,755 --> 00:50:52,598
Bill? This is yours.

661
00:50:52,723 --> 00:50:54,532
And I think you've got my football.

662
00:50:54,725 --> 00:50:55,669
Thank you.

663
00:50:56,761 --> 00:50:58,331
So you're calling
yourself Anjali here?

664
00:50:58,396 --> 00:51:00,672
Did you all find your footballs?

665
00:51:00,731 --> 00:51:01,607
Yes.

666
00:51:01,999 --> 00:51:02,500
Yes.

667
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:06,512
See when you were
busy finding your ball..

668
00:51:06,670 --> 00:51:08,115
You couldn't find it.

669
00:51:08,172 --> 00:51:11,153
But when you returned
someone else ball to them.

670
00:51:11,375 --> 00:51:13,116
You found yours too.

671
00:51:13,277 --> 00:51:14,551
Same with love.

672
00:51:15,045 --> 00:51:16,319
So lesson of the day.

673
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:19,251
Give love to find true love.

674
00:51:19,383 --> 00:51:21,056
Babyji. - Rocks.

675
00:51:23,187 --> 00:51:26,100
Shruti what are you doing here?

676
00:51:27,058 --> 00:51:28,765
Mom said you guys left Tanakpur.

677
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:31,570
Sorry I think you're mistaken.

678
00:51:31,796 --> 00:51:34,242
You're Shruti.
Your eyes haven't changed at all.

679
00:51:34,298 --> 00:51:35,106
Just like they were before.

680
00:51:35,166 --> 00:51:36,645
I am Anjali. - I am Akash.

681
00:51:36,701 --> 00:51:38,703
Akash from Tanakpur. You know me.

682
00:51:38,769 --> 00:51:40,476
No one knows anyone here.

683
00:51:41,272 --> 00:51:42,410
That's why we're all here.

684
00:51:42,707 --> 00:51:46,348
And I think you've mistaken
me for one of my cousins.

685
00:51:46,510 --> 00:51:47,750
We all look the same.

686
00:52:00,491 --> 00:52:01,196
Yes, sir.

687
00:52:01,258 --> 00:52:02,532
Did you get the contract?

688
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:04,230
No, sir don't worry.

689
00:52:04,295 --> 00:52:05,330
I'll return with the contract.

690
00:52:05,396 --> 00:52:06,602
Don't come back without the contract.

691
00:52:06,964 --> 00:52:07,635
Yes, sir.

692
00:52:20,444 --> 00:52:22,321
First rub your hands.

693
00:52:24,381 --> 00:52:27,521
Now hold the book of your life.

694
00:52:27,985 --> 00:52:31,990
Peek in your past.
Don't drive in the lane fast.

695
00:52:32,890 --> 00:52:34,028
First love..

696
00:52:34,325 --> 00:52:36,032
Why does first love happen?

697
00:52:36,193 --> 00:52:39,072
Because it doesn't happen again?

698
00:52:39,997 --> 00:52:42,375
Remember that first moment.

699
00:52:42,666 --> 00:52:46,307
When your soul touched her hean.

700
00:52:46,504 --> 00:52:48,506
Was that your soul mate?

701
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:51,447
Please don't wait.

702
00:52:52,309 --> 00:52:53,344
Don't wait.

703
00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:03,026
Remember what was that moment.

704
00:53:03,287 --> 00:53:05,528
When you realized first love.

705
00:53:05,656 --> 00:53:09,627
Was it a strangenwho
looked like a kin.

706
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:12,233
Maybe he was your soul mate.

707
00:53:32,249 --> 00:53:33,455
Very good.

708
00:53:33,517 --> 00:53:34,894
Now smile.

709
00:53:35,085 --> 00:53:35,927
Smile.

710
00:53:36,053 --> 00:53:38,124
Smile Shruti.

711
00:53:38,288 --> 00:53:40,996
Smile. Smile.

712
00:53:41,058 --> 00:53:42,401
You say something.

713
00:53:42,993 --> 00:53:44,529
Smile, dear.

714
00:54:00,878 --> 00:54:02,380
Bye
-Bye.

715
00:54:08,319 --> 00:54:12,358
497..498..499..500..!

716
00:54:17,261 --> 00:54:19,502
My grandfather said..

717
00:54:19,563 --> 00:54:22,066
Her home is 500 steps away
from the studio.

718
00:54:22,132 --> 00:54:25,807
And my hean will beat really hard
in front of her home.

719
00:54:25,870 --> 00:54:28,612
But my hean isn't beating.

720
00:55:02,072 --> 00:55:04,951
Where am I? - The hospital.

721
00:55:05,409 --> 00:55:06,945
I am very sorry.

722
00:55:07,077 --> 00:55:08,988
We had to cut one of your leg?

723
00:55:09,079 --> 00:55:09,682
What?

724
00:55:16,654 --> 00:55:19,396
Will you marry me? - No.

725
00:55:19,657 --> 00:55:22,604
Why? - Because we're still very small.

726
00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:24,230
Will you marry me when we grow up?

727
00:55:24,361 --> 00:55:27,103
Then you'll have to cut your hair.
- Promise.

728
00:55:27,164 --> 00:55:29,303
You promise? - Promise.

729
00:55:40,477 --> 00:55:41,421
See.

730
00:56:29,326 --> 00:56:31,169
Contract. Contract. Contract.

731
00:56:31,261 --> 00:56:32,604
Where is the contract?

732
00:56:32,763 --> 00:56:34,265
Four days have passed.

733
00:56:34,398 --> 00:56:37,572
Always remember..
Shakspeare has said..

734
00:56:37,634 --> 00:56:40,205
No one wait for time and tide.

735
00:56:40,771 --> 00:56:42,648
Give me contract.

736
00:56:42,773 --> 00:56:43,774
No!

737
00:56:45,209 --> 00:56:50,181
Bro all okay? - Just a bad dream.

738
00:56:51,215 --> 00:56:52,387
You're acting like
sensex these days.

739
00:56:52,449 --> 00:56:54,326
Sometimes up and sometimes down.

740
00:56:54,451 --> 00:56:55,327
Chill.

741
00:56:56,019 --> 00:56:57,259
The three-day trip stans tomorrow.

742
00:56:57,454 --> 00:56:59,058
And your panner is Mrs. Pablo.

743
00:56:59,623 --> 00:57:00,363
Right.

744
00:57:00,424 --> 00:57:02,062
Babyji Rocks.

745
00:57:03,594 --> 00:57:07,701
In order to fill your lazy
life with romance and thrill..

746
00:57:07,764 --> 00:57:10,108
We'll be giving you a unique task.

747
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:13,079
Each one of you will be dropped
off in a new, unknown city..

748
00:57:13,404 --> 00:57:15,042
Along with your partners.

749
00:57:15,272 --> 00:57:18,446
And you'll have nothing
but faith in your partner.

750
00:57:18,509 --> 00:57:20,716
No mobile, or map or money.

751
00:57:20,844 --> 00:57:22,152
How will you get back?

752
00:57:22,212 --> 00:57:24,089
But you must come back.
In three days.

753
00:57:24,314 --> 00:57:25,793
Your time stans now.

754
00:57:26,149 --> 00:57:27,321
The lesson of the day.

755
00:57:27,384 --> 00:57:30,627
Be like a little Kid fill
your pockets with courage.

756
00:57:30,687 --> 00:57:33,497
And while walking down
unknown lanes don't stop"

757
00:57:33,557 --> 00:57:34,661
Don't ever tire.

758
00:57:35,092 --> 00:57:37,538
There's a change
in plan in this trip"

759
00:57:37,694 --> 00:57:39,367
Which will make you trip.

760
00:57:49,172 --> 00:57:50,276
I'm so sorry.

761
00:57:50,474 --> 00:57:52,283
People come here looking
for mental peace.

762
00:57:52,343 --> 00:57:53,549
But you failed to
crack your business deal.

763
00:57:53,911 --> 00:57:55,982
And you got stuck with
me instead of Mrs. Pablo.

764
00:57:56,246 --> 00:57:57,520
What are you so happy about?

765
00:57:58,248 --> 00:58:01,229
Well for staners, we're alive.

766
00:58:01,552 --> 00:58:04,362
And we can be
whoever we want to be.

767
00:58:04,521 --> 00:58:05,625
What mess did I get myself into?

768
00:58:05,956 --> 00:58:07,435
Remembenwhat Babyji has said.

769
00:58:07,624 --> 00:58:10,400
Be like little Kids fill
your pockets. - Stop it.

770
00:58:10,661 --> 00:58:11,503
Think about it.

771
00:58:11,562 --> 00:58:12,336
How do kids behave?

772
00:58:12,563 --> 00:58:13,200
Always happy.

773
00:58:13,263 --> 00:58:14,207
They say anything they want.

774
00:58:14,264 --> 00:58:15,607
They do anything they
like without a care.

775
00:58:15,933 --> 00:58:17,640
But we teach them to be afraid.

776
00:58:18,569 --> 00:58:19,570
Hello!

777
00:58:19,636 --> 00:58:21,411
We'll die in this cold. Are you mad?

778
00:58:21,471 --> 00:58:23,178
Stop complaining.

779
00:58:23,707 --> 00:58:25,948
Trap these moments in your fist.

780
00:58:26,443 --> 00:58:27,945
Small pleasures of life.

781
00:58:28,345 --> 00:58:29,415
WOW!

782
00:58:30,614 --> 00:58:31,558
Okay.

783
00:58:32,483 --> 00:58:33,928
We're dead.

784
00:58:35,385 --> 00:58:36,125
Saved.

785
00:58:37,354 --> 00:58:39,925
Please don't. Listen.

786
00:58:41,124 --> 00:58:42,159
Listen

787
00:58:44,528 --> 00:58:45,973
Stop!

788
00:58:54,771 --> 00:58:57,308
See the benefits of
showing little courage.

789
00:58:57,841 --> 00:58:59,787
Roof on our heads cozy blanket.

790
00:59:01,178 --> 00:59:02,282
WOW!

791
00:59:02,679 --> 00:59:06,286
Let's do one thing. Let's
visit the mental asylum tomorrow.

792
00:59:06,383 --> 00:59:08,363
Small pleasures of life, Akash.

793
00:59:09,820 --> 00:59:13,267
You and I, lost
in a random country.

794
00:59:15,892 --> 00:59:17,929
"And our passpons are lost."

795
00:59:18,295 --> 00:59:21,037
"And the police kill us both."

796
00:59:21,165 --> 00:59:23,167
"And sell our kidneys for a price."

797
00:59:23,367 --> 00:59:24,778
You're so negative.

798
00:59:25,769 --> 00:59:27,510
Well, I'm off to sleep.

799
00:59:27,904 --> 00:59:29,850
Goodnight.
Sweet dreams. - By the way..

800
00:59:30,107 --> 00:59:32,781
I've a habit of kicking in my sleep.
lncase if I touch you here or there.

801
00:59:32,910 --> 00:59:34,082
I am sorry.

802
00:59:35,145 --> 00:59:37,091
You're such a coward, Akash..

803
00:59:37,181 --> 00:59:40,185
That you won't take advantage
even if you get a chance.

804
00:59:40,818 --> 00:59:41,455
Good night!

805
00:59:42,219 --> 00:59:42,993
Coward uncle.

806
01:00:04,308 --> 01:00:05,150
Hey!

807
01:00:05,709 --> 01:00:06,312
Wake up.

808
01:00:06,376 --> 01:00:07,855
What?

809
01:00:08,378 --> 01:00:10,016
What do we do?
How do we get out of here?

810
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:12,424
Stop complaining in the morning.

811
01:00:12,649 --> 01:00:14,060
What complain.

812
01:00:18,956 --> 01:00:21,300
Sleep, sleep..

813
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:24,395
I've an idea.

814
01:00:25,162 --> 01:00:25,936
What?

815
01:00:29,866 --> 01:00:30,901
What kind of an idea is this?

816
01:00:31,802 --> 01:00:32,678
Hey!

817
01:00:35,038 --> 01:00:36,176
He wants to say something

818
01:00:40,744 --> 01:00:43,384
Why is he looking
at us with lustful eyes?

819
01:00:43,780 --> 01:00:46,784
Not us, he's watching
you with lustful eyes.

820
01:00:48,185 --> 01:00:49,721
What are you doing?

821
01:00:54,458 --> 01:00:56,096
For God's sake, please let me go.

822
01:00:57,127 --> 01:00:57,662
Sorry.

823
01:00:57,694 --> 01:01:00,072
You must tarnish your
honor in order to save us.

824
01:01:12,743 --> 01:01:14,814
Come.. Come..

825
01:01:16,813 --> 01:01:17,848
Come on sit.

826
01:01:19,883 --> 01:01:22,363
Hey! Hey! Stop! That's my bike.

827
01:01:33,330 --> 01:01:35,037
Come on. Come on.
- This way.

828
01:01:35,732 --> 01:01:36,836
Fast.

829
01:01:42,773 --> 01:01:44,946
Come on.. Come..

830
01:01:47,377 --> 01:01:48,515
Come on, get in.

831
01:02:21,545 --> 01:02:23,024
What happened?

832
01:02:37,194 --> 01:02:38,366
Who the hell is that?

833
01:02:39,329 --> 01:02:40,672
Somebody on my farm.

834
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,445
Get out of here!

835
01:02:51,174 --> 01:02:52,551
Get off from my farm.

836
01:03:09,459 --> 01:03:11,666
Yes, what is it?
- Hi, can we get a room please.

837
01:03:11,728 --> 01:03:12,934
I have no room.

838
01:03:13,430 --> 01:03:15,341
But ma'am.

839
01:03:17,134 --> 01:03:17,737
Let's go.

840
01:03:18,568 --> 01:03:19,342
Hey!

841
01:03:20,337 --> 01:03:21,975
Sleeping back.

842
01:03:23,373 --> 01:03:25,148
Thank you.
I'm going to sleep in this.

843
01:03:25,208 --> 01:03:27,586
No, I will.
- I'm going to sleep in this.

844
01:03:27,744 --> 01:03:28,415
Why?

845
01:03:28,545 --> 01:03:30,286
There are many other
police stations in this city.

846
01:04:21,264 --> 01:04:25,371
"We've set out on a path."

847
01:04:25,535 --> 01:04:29,984
Without caring about
where we've to go.

848
01:04:30,073 --> 01:04:34,215
"All the roads are lost."

849
01:04:34,377 --> 01:04:38,757
"The world can't find us now."

850
01:04:38,882 --> 01:04:41,021
"How's this ambiance?"

851
01:04:41,084 --> 01:04:43,155
"Wonh smiling."

852
01:04:43,220 --> 01:04:46,997
"Slow rains everywhere."

853
01:04:47,157 --> 01:04:49,831
"How's this intoxication?"

854
01:04:49,893 --> 01:04:51,964
"Wonh getting immersed."

855
01:04:52,028 --> 01:04:55,566
"Desires are awakening everywhere."

856
01:04:55,799 --> 01:04:57,938
"It's an amazing day."

857
01:04:58,001 --> 01:05:00,072
"It's an amazing day."

858
01:05:00,136 --> 01:05:02,116
"It's an amazing day."

859
01:05:02,239 --> 01:05:04,446
"Take a look."

860
01:05:04,508 --> 01:05:06,488
"It's an amazing day."

861
01:05:06,776 --> 01:05:08,915
"It's an amazing day."

862
01:05:08,979 --> 01:05:10,925
"It's an amazing day."

863
01:05:11,047 --> 01:05:13,084
"Take a look."

864
01:05:32,068 --> 01:05:34,048
"I am like the water."

865
01:05:34,204 --> 01:05:36,081
"Let me flow."

866
01:05:36,373 --> 01:05:40,617
"Let me stay the way I am."

867
01:05:40,910 --> 01:05:44,824
The worldly ties can't
restrain me.

868
01:05:45,215 --> 01:05:49,129
"I don't know how to stop or wait."

869
01:05:49,186 --> 01:05:51,257
"How's this ambiance?"

870
01:05:51,321 --> 01:05:53,358
"Wonh smiling."

871
01:05:53,490 --> 01:05:57,438
"Slow rains everywhere."

872
01:05:57,861 --> 01:06:00,068
"How's this intoxication?"

873
01:06:00,130 --> 01:06:02,201
"Wonh getting immersed."

874
01:06:02,265 --> 01:06:05,906
"Desires are awakening everywhere."

875
01:06:06,069 --> 01:06:08,106
"It's an amazing day."

876
01:06:08,171 --> 01:06:10,242
"It's an amazing day."

877
01:06:10,307 --> 01:06:12,344
"It's an amazing day."

878
01:06:12,409 --> 01:06:14,548
"Take a look."

879
01:06:14,878 --> 01:06:16,949
"It's an amazing day."

880
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:19,060
"It's an amazing day."

881
01:06:19,215 --> 01:06:21,126
"It's an amazing day."

882
01:06:21,184 --> 01:06:23,255
"Take a look."

883
01:06:55,452 --> 01:06:57,329
"Why's the earth blue?"

884
01:06:57,554 --> 01:06:59,556
"Why's the sky blue?"

885
01:06:59,890 --> 01:07:04,100
Feels like the sky's
lying on the grass.

886
01:07:04,194 --> 01:07:08,404
"My mischief's my willfulness."

887
01:07:08,531 --> 01:07:12,274
"I've found my freedom."

888
01:07:12,435 --> 01:07:14,472
"How's this ambiance?"

889
01:07:14,638 --> 01:07:16,640
"Wonh smiling."

890
01:07:16,973 --> 01:07:20,921
"Slow rains everywhere."

891
01:07:21,277 --> 01:07:23,382
"How's this intoxication?"

892
01:07:23,513 --> 01:07:25,550
"Wonh getting immersed."

893
01:07:25,615 --> 01:07:29,222
"Desires are awakening everywhere."

894
01:07:29,385 --> 01:07:31,422
"It's an amazing day."

895
01:07:31,554 --> 01:07:33,591
"It's an amazing day."

896
01:07:33,890 --> 01:07:35,665
"It's an amazing day."

897
01:07:35,959 --> 01:07:38,064
"Take a look."

898
01:07:38,328 --> 01:07:40,274
"It's an amazing day."

899
01:07:40,397 --> 01:07:42,377
"It's an amazing day."

900
01:07:42,499 --> 01:07:44,570
"It's an amazing day."

901
01:07:44,634 --> 01:07:46,307
"Take a look."

902
01:07:52,175 --> 01:07:53,347
Good morning.

903
01:07:53,543 --> 01:07:56,114
It gives me great pleasure
to inform all of you..

904
01:07:56,479 --> 01:07:59,187
That Baba's absolutely fine now.

905
01:07:59,649 --> 01:08:02,027
But he's on a vow of silence.

906
01:08:03,019 --> 01:08:06,899
I want to wish everyone
goodbye and good luck.

907
01:08:07,090 --> 01:08:10,503
When you all go back
home and open your suitcases.

908
01:08:10,660 --> 01:08:13,607
You'll realize,
that it's the same suitcase..

909
01:08:13,663 --> 01:08:16,269
But everything inside it seems new.

910
01:08:16,466 --> 01:08:19,675
That's why everything you found..

911
01:08:20,003 --> 01:08:21,641
And attained with courage.

912
01:08:22,138 --> 01:08:24,140
That was real fun.

913
01:08:24,407 --> 01:08:26,011
Babaji.. - Rocks!

914
01:08:26,109 --> 01:08:27,588
Babaji.. - Rocks!

915
01:08:27,644 --> 01:08:30,716
It's so cold. That Babaji
has turned into a rock himself.

916
01:08:31,247 --> 01:08:32,282
Is he still alive or passed away?

917
01:08:32,448 --> 01:08:33,552
He's still alive.

918
01:08:34,317 --> 01:08:36,490
Babaji.. - Rocks!

919
01:08:36,686 --> 01:08:38,427
Babaji.. - Rocks!

920
01:08:39,122 --> 01:08:39,725
This is wrong..

921
01:08:40,123 --> 01:08:40,692
Papa!

922
01:08:42,092 --> 01:08:43,730
I want to tell you
something important.

923
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:45,268
Tell me what's so important.

924
01:08:46,162 --> 01:08:49,632
I am in love.
- Who's that beautiful fairy?

925
01:08:49,699 --> 01:08:50,507
Yes.

926
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:51,478
Come.

927
01:08:52,302 --> 01:08:53,144
It's him.

928
01:08:57,207 --> 01:08:59,619
I thought we'll welcome
a daughter-in-law.

929
01:08:59,943 --> 01:09:01,889
But he's got us
a son-in-law instead.

930
01:09:03,213 --> 01:09:04,055
Hello.

931
01:09:04,547 --> 01:09:05,457
Hello.

932
01:09:06,249 --> 01:09:07,421
See you, come on, fast.

933
01:09:09,953 --> 01:09:12,194
You know we're always taught that.

934
01:09:12,255 --> 01:09:14,633
The faster you run,
the quicker you get ahead.

935
01:09:15,258 --> 01:09:18,239
But no one tells you whether
you'll get happiness or not.

936
01:09:19,229 --> 01:09:21,334
Dreams, aspirations, ambitions..

937
01:09:21,831 --> 01:09:24,209
And what about the one we
left behind in this race of dreams?

938
01:09:25,201 --> 01:09:28,944
The world makes us
keep running after money.

939
01:09:29,572 --> 01:09:30,846
Keeps making us delusional.

940
01:09:31,074 --> 01:09:32,553
So that we don't
find real happiness.

941
01:09:36,146 --> 01:09:37,853
I wonder why I left
these small joys..

942
01:09:37,914 --> 01:09:39,860
And running after stupid dream?

943
01:09:40,950 --> 01:09:41,655
Excuse me.

944
01:09:42,051 --> 01:09:43,928
Excuse me.
There's a phone call for you.

945
01:09:43,987 --> 01:09:45,295
Yeah, coming.

946
01:09:49,159 --> 01:09:50,069
Yeah, sure.

947
01:09:56,199 --> 01:09:57,007
Shruti.

948
01:09:58,168 --> 01:09:59,875
Listen..Shruti.

949
01:10:00,436 --> 01:10:02,109
I know you're my
Shruti from Tanakpur.

950
01:10:02,505 --> 01:10:03,415
Shruti..

951
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:05,641
I love you.

952
01:10:08,011 --> 01:10:11,322
If we're destined for it,
we'll definitely meet again.

953
01:10:12,415 --> 01:10:14,326
Otherwise this is final goodbye.

954
01:10:15,418 --> 01:10:16,396
Shruti..

955
01:10:19,556 --> 01:10:21,297
I can't live without you.

956
01:10:24,327 --> 01:10:27,308
Akash, love is a journey
that's measured in depths.

957
01:10:27,664 --> 01:10:29,371
And not miles.

958
01:10:29,666 --> 01:10:32,613
It's not imponant
how long we lived..

959
01:10:33,403 --> 01:10:36,384
What's important is how
much we lived during that time?

960
01:10:38,341 --> 01:10:39,251
Shruti.

961
01:10:40,176 --> 01:10:41,314
Shruti.

962
01:10:42,045 --> 01:10:43,023
Shruti.

963
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:44,481
Shruti.

964
01:10:45,148 --> 01:10:46,058
Shruti.

965
01:10:56,693 --> 01:10:59,299
Shruti!

966
01:11:11,474 --> 01:11:13,010
I am..

967
01:11:13,877 --> 01:11:15,083
I am sorry.

968
01:11:16,412 --> 01:11:19,018
Whatever I did with you was a lie.

969
01:11:20,216 --> 01:11:21,354
I shouldn't have done it.

970
01:11:22,385 --> 01:11:27,767
I came to this camp
only to save my job.

971
01:11:29,959 --> 01:11:33,304
And in return you found her love.

972
01:11:37,867 --> 01:11:38,868
I don't know.

973
01:11:42,005 --> 01:11:43,746
Won't you ask for the contract?

974
01:11:49,112 --> 01:11:51,285
Because you're my friend.

975
01:11:52,849 --> 01:11:55,261
And I don't do
business with friends.

976
01:12:20,777 --> 01:12:21,778
Welcome.

977
01:12:22,278 --> 01:12:24,121
Did you get the contract?

978
01:12:27,250 --> 01:12:28,354
Answer me.

979
01:12:29,252 --> 01:12:30,253
What are you thinking?

980
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:34,065
Always remember what Shakspeare said.

981
01:12:35,224 --> 01:12:37,101
Many fathers of success.

982
01:12:38,128 --> 01:12:40,472
But the orphan is the failure.

983
01:12:42,098 --> 01:12:45,375
Pack your stuff and get lost.

984
01:12:45,435 --> 01:12:46,311
Out!

985
01:12:48,705 --> 01:12:49,877
Finish that.

986
01:12:51,407 --> 01:12:52,408
Mr. Handu!

987
01:12:52,709 --> 01:12:53,687
Handu..

988
01:12:54,243 --> 01:12:55,847
Who is Handu? - Come here.

989
01:12:56,345 --> 01:12:58,416
You called me Handu.

990
01:12:58,715 --> 01:13:01,787
I called you Handu.
- You called me Handu!

991
01:13:02,151 --> 01:13:03,129
Relax.

992
01:13:03,186 --> 01:13:04,460
Tell me something.

993
01:13:05,455 --> 01:13:07,298
Were you born this way..

994
01:13:07,824 --> 01:13:10,304
Or did you hit your head
when you were small.

995
01:13:10,426 --> 01:13:12,133
What? Shut up?

996
01:13:12,195 --> 01:13:13,970
How can any human being..

997
01:13:14,030 --> 01:13:16,032
Keep barking all
day without a reason.

998
01:13:16,099 --> 01:13:18,739
I.. I.. I bark.. - No, no, no,
don't get me wrong, sir.

999
01:13:18,835 --> 01:13:21,145
You don't bark..
you're are still barking.

1000
01:13:21,204 --> 01:13:22,239
I am barking. - Yes.

1001
01:13:22,371 --> 01:13:24,510
And in wrong English.
- Wrong English?

1002
01:13:24,841 --> 01:13:26,752
You trouble your
staff all the time"

1003
01:13:26,809 --> 01:13:31,121
In fact, even Shakespeare.
- How you make fun of me..

1004
01:13:31,180 --> 01:13:33,888
No one respects you here, Handu.

1005
01:13:35,118 --> 01:13:36,062
They are all scared.

1006
01:13:36,119 --> 01:13:37,928
Of their responsibilities
towards their wife and child.

1007
01:13:37,987 --> 01:13:40,331
Their car and home EMIs.

1008
01:13:40,823 --> 01:13:42,803
They scared of their daily life.

1009
01:13:43,259 --> 01:13:45,296
But I am not scared. Not anymore.

1010
01:13:46,829 --> 01:13:48,206
I will survive, Mr. Handu.

1011
01:13:48,364 --> 01:13:49,934
I'll be very happy.

1012
01:13:50,266 --> 01:13:53,110
Because I am not a
slave of my dreams anymore.

1013
01:13:53,970 --> 01:13:57,110
Mr. Handu..
- Don't call me Handu.

1014
01:13:57,173 --> 01:13:59,414
You need us,
as much as we need you.

1015
01:14:01,744 --> 01:14:03,189
I found my truth.

1016
01:14:05,381 --> 01:14:06,382
But not you.

1017
01:14:06,783 --> 01:14:08,990
Someone throw him out.

1018
01:14:09,152 --> 01:14:10,062
Out.

1019
01:14:12,956 --> 01:14:14,902
You make me work in this condition.

1020
01:14:16,025 --> 01:14:17,060
You're inhuman.

1021
01:14:17,260 --> 01:14:20,173
You idiot. - How dare you..

1022
01:14:21,264 --> 01:14:22,470
I am a idiot.

1023
01:14:23,433 --> 01:14:26,175
I remember those days..what
you made me go through.

1024
01:14:27,470 --> 01:14:29,074
I am resigning.

1025
01:14:29,438 --> 01:14:30,314
Me too.

1026
01:14:30,540 --> 01:14:32,042
Even I am leaving with Akash.

1027
01:14:32,208 --> 01:14:33,312
I am also resigning.

1028
01:14:34,310 --> 01:14:38,258
Please, stop it.

1029
01:14:38,314 --> 01:14:39,588
Don't go please, I'm sorry.

1030
01:14:39,849 --> 01:14:42,386
Please forgive me.

1031
01:14:42,451 --> 01:14:45,159
I beg you, please stop.

1032
01:14:45,355 --> 01:14:50,202
Always remember
what Shakspeare said.

1033
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:55,272
To regret do a little wrong.
- What?

1034
01:14:55,331 --> 01:14:57,106
No! No! No!
Don't remember Shakespeare.

1035
01:14:58,034 --> 01:14:59,342
I am sorry Akash.

1036
01:15:15,318 --> 01:15:17,025
We can't give you anyone's address.

1037
01:15:17,186 --> 01:15:17,994
Sorry, sir.

1038
01:15:18,087 --> 01:15:19,065
Babaji rocks!

1039
01:15:25,027 --> 01:15:26,563
And it's possible that
she might be married.

1040
01:15:26,629 --> 01:15:28,939
Or maybe she already
has a boyfriend.

1041
01:15:44,581 --> 01:15:45,924
Akash, take my advice.

1042
01:15:46,249 --> 01:15:47,990
You're destined for someone else,
not her.

1043
01:15:56,292 --> 01:15:58,101
It's been one full year.

1044
01:15:58,327 --> 01:16:01,331
And she didn't give you her number
or address, or anything else.

1045
01:16:20,383 --> 01:16:21,293
Shruti.

1046
01:16:23,653 --> 01:16:24,757
Taxi.

1047
01:16:43,673 --> 01:16:44,617
Shruti!

1048
01:16:45,641 --> 01:16:46,642
Shruti!

1049
01:16:53,416 --> 01:16:54,622
Shruti!

1050
01:17:20,109 --> 01:17:21,349
Do you want to die?

1051
01:17:28,184 --> 01:17:28,992
Akash.

1052
01:17:29,251 --> 01:17:30,286
Sit, sit please.

1053
01:17:30,720 --> 01:17:32,529
Will you please come
to my cabin for a minute?

1054
01:17:32,989 --> 01:17:33,467
Sure, sir.

1055
01:17:33,522 --> 01:17:34,762
Someone’s here to see you.

1056
01:17:42,632 --> 01:17:47,047
The more I looked for love the
more I've been unsuccessful.

1057
01:17:48,704 --> 01:17:52,618
I didn't want love from Pablo,
only security.

1058
01:17:53,809 --> 01:17:55,379
Today I am secure.

1059
01:17:57,046 --> 01:17:58,753
But the one I love..

1060
01:18:01,517 --> 01:18:03,053
Doesn't love me.

1061
01:18:12,395 --> 01:18:13,237
Anyways.

1062
01:18:13,596 --> 01:18:17,635
Remember, you said you
don't do business with friends.

1063
01:18:18,101 --> 01:18:20,377
Fine then, let me do
business with your company.

1064
01:18:21,237 --> 01:18:23,080
This way we can stay friends.

1065
01:18:24,206 --> 01:18:26,186
I am starting a new company.

1066
01:18:26,375 --> 01:18:28,480
And for that I need your company.

1067
01:18:29,078 --> 01:18:29,852
What say?

1068
01:18:33,716 --> 01:18:34,717
Are you crazy?

1069
01:18:35,184 --> 01:18:36,322
It's the best offer, take it.

1070
01:18:36,385 --> 01:18:37,728
If it was me, I would've
readily accepted her offer.

1071
01:18:37,787 --> 01:18:39,562
Married her and become her slave.

1072
01:18:39,822 --> 01:18:41,358
And she's hot, man.

1073
01:18:41,557 --> 01:18:44,538
Sexy, young,
loaded and in love with you.

1074
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:46,398
What else do you want?

1075
01:18:46,662 --> 01:18:49,438
Don't people buy used cars? Tell me.

1076
01:18:49,765 --> 01:18:52,302
Look, this is the
best chance for you.

1077
01:18:52,668 --> 01:18:55,444
She's giving you a great
offer that too, in the US.

1078
01:18:56,305 --> 01:18:58,216
It's been too long now, buddy.

1079
01:18:58,574 --> 01:18:59,609
Be practical

1080
01:19:24,166 --> 01:19:25,941
I've found Shruti's address

1081
01:19:26,402 --> 01:19:28,177
The camp runs on my funding.

1082
01:19:40,483 --> 01:19:41,154
Really?

1083
01:19:41,717 --> 01:19:49,295
On the wet-drenched roads..
I wait for you.

1084
01:19:49,959 --> 01:19:58,071
Slowly-gradually..
I surrender my hean to you.

1085
01:19:58,267 --> 01:20:06,379
I want to lose myself..
and never be found.

1086
01:20:06,442 --> 01:20:13,826
Slowly.. I want to
handover my life to you.

1087
01:20:13,983 --> 01:20:17,829
"Sweetheart."

1088
01:20:18,554 --> 01:20:21,865
"You're now my sweetheart"

1089
01:20:22,191 --> 01:20:26,003
"Sweetheart."

1090
01:20:26,896 --> 01:20:30,070
"You're now my sweetheart"

1091
01:20:30,366 --> 01:20:34,280
"Your grace."

1092
01:20:34,870 --> 01:20:38,579
"You showered me with your grace."

1093
01:20:38,808 --> 01:20:42,255
"Sweetheart."

1094
01:20:43,312 --> 01:20:46,987
"You're now my sweetheart"

1095
01:21:04,366 --> 01:21:08,041
"As I get closer to you.."

1096
01:21:08,104 --> 01:21:11,278
"All my illusions are shattered."

1097
01:21:11,540 --> 01:21:15,886
"Sweetheart."

1098
01:21:16,312 --> 01:21:19,589
"You're now my sweetheart"

1099
01:21:19,915 --> 01:21:23,988
"Sweetheart."

1100
01:21:24,487 --> 01:21:28,560
"You're now my sweetheart"

1101
01:22:01,624 --> 01:22:09,441
Like the clouds
you've given my refuge.

1102
01:22:10,099 --> 01:22:17,608
Like the rains you've
drenched me with joy.

1103
01:22:18,274 --> 01:22:25,692
And you've blown
my mind like the storm.

1104
01:22:26,882 --> 01:22:30,921
You've made my shaped
my destiny in a way..

1105
01:22:30,986 --> 01:22:34,399
By bringing a
new dawn in my life.

1106
01:22:34,456 --> 01:22:42,136
I want to spend all
my lifetimes with you.

1107
01:22:42,198 --> 01:22:46,408
"Sweetheart."

1108
01:22:46,936 --> 01:22:50,281
"You're now my sweetheart"

1109
01:22:50,439 --> 01:22:54,012
"Sweetheart."

1110
01:22:55,144 --> 01:22:58,557
"You're now my sweetheart"

1111
01:22:58,614 --> 01:23:02,426
"Your grace."

1112
01:23:03,152 --> 01:23:06,964
"You showered me with your grace."

1113
01:23:07,022 --> 01:23:10,492
"Sweetheart."

1114
01:23:14,963 --> 01:23:16,033
She used to live here.

1115
01:23:16,098 --> 01:23:17,668
But it's been a year since she left.

1116
01:23:20,202 --> 01:23:24,173
"You showered me with your grace."

1117
01:23:24,340 --> 01:23:28,413
"You're now my sweetheart"

1118
01:23:28,477 --> 01:23:32,254
"You showered me with your grace."

1119
01:23:36,185 --> 01:23:40,065
Sometimes you get a
lifetime of love in a moment.

1120
01:23:41,624 --> 01:23:44,662
And sometimes even
a lifetime isn't enough..

1121
01:23:45,461 --> 01:23:47,168
To find even a moment of love.

1122
01:23:48,697 --> 01:23:50,335
If you're with me..

1123
01:23:51,300 --> 01:23:53,473
Then we can stan life a new.

1124
01:23:59,542 --> 01:24:01,579
We must take some decision.

1125
01:24:07,583 --> 01:24:08,994
I am ready..

1126
01:24:09,651 --> 01:24:11,460
But before that.

1127
01:24:13,288 --> 01:24:15,199
I must do something
that's still incomplete.

1128
01:25:11,380 --> 01:25:19,595
One, two, three, four, five, six..

1129
01:25:20,256 --> 01:25:26,866
Seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven.

1130
01:25:27,129 --> 01:25:29,609
Twenty-four. Twenty-five.

1131
01:25:30,232 --> 01:25:34,237
Twenty-six, twenty-seven, twenty-eight.

1132
01:25:34,303 --> 01:25:37,011
Thirty-four, thirty-five,
thirty-six, thir1y-seven..

1133
01:25:37,072 --> 01:25:39,211
Thirty-eight,thirty-nine, forty.

1134
01:25:39,275 --> 01:25:42,085
Forty-one, forty-two,
forty-three, forty-four..

1135
01:25:59,828 --> 01:26:06,245
488, 489, 490.

1136
01:26:07,236 --> 01:26:10,843
491, 492..

1137
01:26:20,916 --> 01:26:24,557
496, 497

1138
01:26:26,288 --> 01:26:29,428
498, 499..

1139
01:26:32,261 --> 01:26:33,205
500!

1140
01:27:04,393 --> 01:27:06,100
I knew it will be you.

1141
01:27:08,030 --> 01:27:10,032
We'll meet again
if destiny wants us.

1142
01:27:10,699 --> 01:27:11,803
"Destiny wants it.."

1143
01:27:12,868 --> 01:27:14,142
Because I wanted.

1144
01:27:15,170 --> 01:27:17,047
I was looking for you like a madman.

1145
01:27:22,945 --> 01:27:23,980
I've lost you so many times.

1146
01:27:24,046 --> 01:27:25,855
That I'm even scared
of closing my eyes now.

1147
01:27:27,416 --> 01:27:28,861
But not anymore.

1148
01:27:29,785 --> 01:27:32,789
I love you, Shruti. I love you.

1149
01:27:42,064 --> 01:27:45,136
We've met but unfortunately
only to say goodbye.

1150
01:27:45,701 --> 01:27:46,679
What do you mean?

1151
01:27:48,470 --> 01:27:50,916
We cannot stay together. - Why?

1152
01:27:52,274 --> 01:27:53,810
Because I said so.

1153
01:27:56,111 --> 01:27:56,885
I see..

1154
01:27:57,246 --> 01:27:59,089
Only you have the right to decide.

1155
01:27:59,148 --> 01:28:01,059
When we stay together
and when we should separate?

1156
01:28:01,116 --> 01:28:02,356
Akash, please.

1157
01:28:03,719 --> 01:28:05,027
Is there someone else in your life?

1158
01:28:06,422 --> 01:28:07,765
Are you..

1159
01:28:09,792 --> 01:28:11,032
Don't you love me?

1160
01:28:15,397 --> 01:28:20,813
Every moment, every second.
I only loved you, Akash.

1161
01:28:25,073 --> 01:28:26,746
Then what's the problem.

1162
01:28:29,411 --> 01:28:32,085
Not every question has an answer.

1163
01:28:34,216 --> 01:28:36,719
And you can't be the
only one to break heans.

1164
01:28:37,786 --> 01:28:40,323
Oh now I get it.

1165
01:28:40,389 --> 01:28:43,063
Revenge is more important
for you than our love.

1166
01:28:46,328 --> 01:28:47,932
I am sorry, Akash.

1167
01:28:48,997 --> 01:28:50,101
Please go.

1168
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:52,110
Please.

1169
01:29:47,956 --> 01:29:51,028
Will you marry me? - No.

1170
01:29:51,226 --> 01:29:53,866
Why? - Because we're still kids.

1171
01:29:54,062 --> 01:29:55,473
So will you marry
me when we grow up?

1172
01:29:55,764 --> 01:29:58,438
Then you must cut your hair.
- Promise.‘

1173
01:29:58,500 --> 01:30:00,946
Do you promise? - I do.

1174
01:31:18,446 --> 01:31:19,390
Where is she?

1175
01:31:20,449 --> 01:31:22,156
Who? - Shruti.

1176
01:31:24,086 --> 01:31:26,532
Who are you?
- I should be asking you that.

1177
01:31:26,922 --> 01:31:28,128
She's my cousin.

1178
01:31:28,557 --> 01:31:30,332
I am her doctor. What's the problem?

1179
01:31:30,492 --> 01:31:31,493
What's the problem?

1180
01:31:31,560 --> 01:31:32,903
Where is she?

1181
01:31:44,272 --> 01:31:45,444
She's dying.

1182
01:31:45,841 --> 01:31:47,479
Severe Coronary Amery Disease.

1183
01:31:48,176 --> 01:31:50,850
Her chances of surviving without
a heart transplant is impossible.

1184
01:31:51,213 --> 01:31:52,351
We had a word with the hospital.

1185
01:31:52,414 --> 01:31:54,223
There is a brain dead patient.

1186
01:31:54,950 --> 01:31:57,794
But her relatives aren't
given their consent.

1187
01:31:58,153 --> 01:31:59,427
If we get the consent.

1188
01:31:59,488 --> 01:32:01,490
Then we can save Shruti.

1189
01:32:02,324 --> 01:32:03,359
We still have hope.

1190
01:32:27,048 --> 01:32:28,391
You left me once.

1191
01:32:31,186 --> 01:32:32,597
This time I'll leave.

1192
01:32:35,057 --> 01:32:36,832
You came back..

1193
01:32:38,293 --> 01:32:39,533
But I won't.

1194
01:32:45,834 --> 01:32:48,144
A beautiful girl once told me.

1195
01:32:51,073 --> 01:32:54,486
It doesn't matter how long we lived.

1196
01:32:56,611 --> 01:33:00,957
What matters is how
much we lived in those days.

1197
01:33:03,485 --> 01:33:05,021
I have only few days.

1198
01:33:08,890 --> 01:33:11,996
See, so many dreams.

1199
01:33:13,528 --> 01:33:15,371
And you're all of them.

1200
01:33:17,132 --> 01:33:19,112
That our story would be like this.

1201
01:33:28,009 --> 01:33:29,010
It will be.

1202
01:33:30,345 --> 01:33:32,154
Our story will be exactly like this.

1203
01:34:01,209 --> 01:34:06,283
"I can change myself for you."

1204
01:34:06,848 --> 01:34:12,230
"I can do anything for you."

1205
01:34:12,354 --> 01:34:17,354
"That's my promise to you forever."

1206
01:34:23,665 --> 01:34:28,842
"I am breathing for you."

1207
01:34:29,237 --> 01:34:34,812
"I am living each day for you."

1208
01:34:34,943 --> 01:34:39,943
You are mine and
I am yours forever.

1209
01:34:46,421 --> 01:34:51,769
"I've no right on myself anymore."

1210
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:56,973
"I am living only for you."

1211
01:34:57,799 --> 01:35:03,306
"My love for you will never lessen."

1212
01:35:03,371 --> 01:35:07,979
"I am living only for you."

1213
01:35:09,044 --> 01:35:14,153
"You're mine and I am your support"

1214
01:35:14,749 --> 01:35:18,287
"I am living only for you."

1215
01:35:20,288 --> 01:35:25,931
Even if I die,
I'll keep my promise.

1216
01:35:26,027 --> 01:35:30,237
"I am living only for you."

1217
01:35:31,733 --> 01:35:35,840
"I am living only for you."

1218
01:35:59,227 --> 01:36:04,142
"It's not just our bodies.."

1219
01:36:04,199 --> 01:36:09,877
It's our soul that's
bound together.

1220
01:36:10,505 --> 01:36:15,352
"Whenever anyone looks at me.."

1221
01:36:15,410 --> 01:36:21,019
"They see your face."

1222
01:36:21,216 --> 01:36:26,825
You're my refuge and
I am your shadow.

1223
01:36:27,021 --> 01:36:32,300
You're my home
and I am your abode.

1224
01:36:32,727 --> 01:36:37,972
You're my destination
and I am the traveler.

1225
01:36:38,133 --> 01:36:43,105
"And I've stopped at you."

1226
01:36:44,472 --> 01:36:50,081
"I've no right on myself anymore."

1227
01:36:50,311 --> 01:36:54,817
"I am living only for you."

1228
01:36:55,884 --> 01:37:01,300
"Someday this age will pass."

1229
01:37:01,523 --> 01:37:06,768
"And life will be complete."

1230
01:37:07,128 --> 01:37:12,237
"But still stay close to me.."

1231
01:37:12,767 --> 01:37:17,512
"When my hean stops beating."

1232
01:37:21,009 --> 01:37:26,357
I want to die in your arms,
sweetheart.

1233
01:37:26,548 --> 01:37:31,327
"That's my last wish."

1234
01:37:33,054 --> 01:37:38,163
"I've no right on myself anymore."

1235
01:37:38,593 --> 01:37:42,063
"I am living only for you."

1236
01:37:44,199 --> 01:37:49,444
"My love for you will never lessen."

1237
01:37:49,971 --> 01:37:53,544
"I am living only for you."

1238
01:38:21,136 --> 01:38:23,047
Any update, doctor? - No, not yet.

1239
01:38:23,671 --> 01:38:26,174
It's really urgent.
My patient is sinking.

1240
01:38:26,241 --> 01:38:27,686
We're looking for a donor.

1241
01:38:28,142 --> 01:38:30,179
Give me some time.
- Doctor, we don't have time.

1242
01:38:30,345 --> 01:38:31,688
Hurry up, for God sake, please.

1243
01:38:32,080 --> 01:38:33,423
Yes, we're trying our best.

1244
01:38:40,688 --> 01:38:42,395
We're completely ready..

1245
01:38:43,591 --> 01:38:45,070
But we haven't
received a hean yet.

1246
01:38:46,694 --> 01:38:48,935
Even Shruti's condition is critical.

1247
01:38:49,297 --> 01:38:52,471
But in these conditions..there's
nothing we can say.

1248
01:39:01,009 --> 01:39:03,011
I am going to die
and become a star.

1249
01:39:04,712 --> 01:39:06,714
The star that will
shine the brightest..

1250
01:39:09,550 --> 01:39:10,688
Will be me.

1251
01:39:11,653 --> 01:39:13,223
Don't forget to say hi.

1252
01:39:18,193 --> 01:39:21,470
Marry her, have kids.

1253
01:39:23,765 --> 01:39:25,335
Make another promise.

1254
01:39:27,468 --> 01:39:30,972
You won't come see me
at the hospital. - But, Shruti..

1255
01:39:31,372 --> 01:39:32,373
Promise?

1256
01:39:35,576 --> 01:39:36,680
Promise.

1257
01:39:39,547 --> 01:39:41,549
Never break a promise, Akash.

1258
01:40:22,156 --> 01:40:23,157
We've found a heart.

1259
01:40:23,525 --> 01:40:25,027
The doctors are prepared
for the operation.

1260
01:40:25,159 --> 01:40:26,570
Please sign here.

1261
01:41:41,002 --> 01:41:42,481
The number you're trying to reach.

1262
01:41:42,704 --> 01:41:44,274
Is currently switched off.

1263
01:41:44,839 --> 01:41:46,716
The number you're trying to reach.

1264
01:41:46,774 --> 01:41:48,310
Is currently switched off.

1265
01:41:53,047 --> 01:41:55,357
Shruti people say that.

1266
01:41:55,416 --> 01:41:59,489
We take many binhs to
complete our incomplete love.

1267
01:42:00,354 --> 01:42:02,425
Meet each other again and again.

1268
01:42:03,758 --> 01:42:05,738
I admit we couldn't meet this time.

1269
01:42:06,494 --> 01:42:09,407
But we will definitely meet again.

1270
01:42:10,832 --> 01:42:11,867
Won't we?

1271
01:42:33,021 --> 01:42:33,829
I don't know.

1272
01:42:33,955 --> 01:42:35,866
He hasn't come to
the office for a month.

1273
01:42:36,024 --> 01:42:37,503
And I don't know.

1274
01:42:37,825 --> 01:42:39,327
Even his mobile is switched off.

1275
01:42:39,894 --> 01:42:43,171
Frankly speakingmone
of us have any idea about this.

1276
01:42:43,898 --> 01:42:46,378
Look, madam we don't
know how true this is.

1277
01:42:46,768 --> 01:42:48,247
But people at the
office are saying.

1278
01:42:48,369 --> 01:42:51,043
That he accepted Mrs.
Pablo's offer.

1279
01:42:51,939 --> 01:42:53,782
And he's going to marry her..

1280
01:43:01,149 --> 01:43:02,492
I don't know, dear.

1281
01:43:02,784 --> 01:43:03,819
He kept telling me..

1282
01:43:03,884 --> 01:43:05,591
That he's going
to get a big contract.

1283
01:43:05,820 --> 01:43:06,958
And he'll go to America.

1284
01:43:07,155 --> 01:43:08,463
Maybe he got his contract.

1285
01:43:16,030 --> 01:43:21,241
"Wait for few more moments."

1286
01:43:21,969 --> 01:43:27,248
"Or come back to me again."

1287
01:43:27,842 --> 01:43:33,224
"This isn't how you say goodbye."

1288
01:43:33,781 --> 01:43:38,924
"Turn back or come home."

1289
01:43:39,654 --> 01:43:47,163
My eyes look for you and
my arms yearn for you.

1290
01:43:49,030 --> 01:43:54,207
"It's hard to live without you."

1291
01:43:54,936 --> 01:43:59,817
"How can I live without you?"

1292
01:44:00,908 --> 01:44:05,948
"It's hard to live without you."

1293
01:44:06,848 --> 01:44:12,355
"How can I live without you?"

1294
01:44:24,665 --> 01:44:29,580
"You made so many promises."

1295
01:44:30,371 --> 01:44:35,753
But you broke them
all in a moment.

1296
01:44:36,277 --> 01:44:41,277
I know you're not a liar
just a bit upset.

1297
01:44:47,788 --> 01:44:50,701
If you're upset.
I'll cajole you.

1298
01:44:50,758 --> 01:44:55,229
"But where do I go without you?"

1299
01:44:57,097 --> 01:45:02,137
"It's hard to live without you."

1300
01:45:03,037 --> 01:45:07,952
"How can I live without you?"

1301
01:45:08,910 --> 01:45:14,019
"It's hard to live without you."

1302
01:45:14,816 --> 01:45:19,959
"How can I live without you?"

1303
01:45:57,291 --> 01:45:59,464
Shruti, people say that.

1304
01:45:59,527 --> 01:46:03,373
We take many births to
complete our incomplete love.

1305
01:46:03,564 --> 01:46:05,544
I admit we couldn't meet this time.

1306
01:46:05,666 --> 01:46:08,647
But we will definitely meet again.

1307
01:46:10,604 --> 01:46:11,480
Won't we?

1308
01:46:12,807 --> 01:46:18,689
"The earth and the sky.."

1309
01:46:18,746 --> 01:46:24,628
"Means nothing without you."

1310
01:46:24,685 --> 01:46:30,567
Ask for a few more
minutes of life..

1311
01:46:30,624 --> 01:46:35,505
"Don't just get up and 
eave."

1312
01:46:36,230 --> 01:46:44,650
Or take me along
wherever you're going.

1313
01:46:45,440 --> 01:46:50,913
"It's hard to live without you."

1314
01:46:51,379 --> 01:46:56,294
"How can I live without you?"

1315
01:46:57,285 --> 01:47:02,792
"It's hard to live without you."

1316
01:47:03,224 --> 01:47:08,640
"How can I live without you?"

1317
01:47:47,501 --> 01:47:50,175
No one knows whether it was
an accident.

1318
01:47:50,838 --> 01:47:52,374
Or whether he killed himself.

1319
01:47:53,174 --> 01:47:54,312
But the truth us..

1320
01:47:54,976 --> 01:47:57,957
He left his heart beating in my body.

1321
01:48:21,869 --> 01:48:23,143
Smile.
