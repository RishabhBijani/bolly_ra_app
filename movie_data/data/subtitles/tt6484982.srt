1
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:22,380
Long Live Mangal Netam!

2
00:01:37,292 --> 00:01:41,718
I am not here to seek votes

3
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:45,844
Don't vote for me

4
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:50,129
I want development for you all

5
00:01:50,667 --> 00:01:56,959
My dream is to see every child
with a laptop in their right hand

6
00:01:57,292 --> 00:01:59,215
And a cell-phone in their left

7
00:01:59,667 --> 00:02:04,753
But they stand like thorns
in my path

8
00:02:04,917 --> 00:02:08,000
I won't allow it as long as I live

9
00:02:08,542 --> 00:02:11,751
The Commies quote parables,
and I perform miracles

10
00:02:11,917 --> 00:02:14,386
If they shoot arrows,
I fire cannons

11
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:16,761
Long Live Mangal Netam!

12
00:02:37,542 --> 00:02:39,636
We'll have dinner together

13
00:02:40,417 --> 00:02:44,877
Don't worry. We're nearly there

14
00:02:45,542 --> 00:02:46,759
Sir!

15
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:51,092
Turn the car around!

16
00:02:53,417 --> 00:02:55,886
Get down!

17
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:18,094
<i>The third incident in two weeks</i>

18
00:03:18,292 --> 00:03:20,260
<i>The Maoists have struck again</i>

19
00:03:20,542 --> 00:03:27,255
<i>The government has promised
stern action</i>

20
00:03:28,042 --> 00:03:31,751
<i>Additional reinforcements
will be deployed</i>

21
00:03:37,667 --> 00:03:39,089
<i>Oh no!</i>

22
00:03:39,292 --> 00:03:41,636
<i>The power has gone again</i>

23
00:03:41,917 --> 00:03:42,884
<i>Nutan</i>

24
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:44,627
<i>- I'm checking
- Son, go and see</i>

25
00:03:44,792 --> 00:03:47,261
The others have power

26
00:03:49,167 --> 00:03:52,626
<i>- I'll check the fuse
- Is it just us?</i>

27
00:03:54,917 --> 00:03:56,134
Must have tripped

28
00:03:56,375 --> 00:04:00,960
<i>Chanchal has left. His workshop
is so successful</i>

29
00:04:01,417 --> 00:04:03,511
<i>He has opened a showroom too</i>

30
00:04:04,917 --> 00:04:07,215
<i>His wife works with him</i>

31
00:04:07,542 --> 00:04:10,216
- The fuse gone again?
- Yes

32
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:14,719
<i>Everyone is getting married
but our son</i>

33
00:04:15,042 --> 00:04:17,761
<i>You seem to know everything</i>

34
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:22,755
<i>I worry about my son</i>

35
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:26,959
<i>- Is the power back?
- Yes, son</i>

36
00:04:27,292 --> 00:04:29,636
- Attending tomorrow's workshop?
- Yes

37
00:04:34,417 --> 00:04:38,752
The Indian election...

38
00:04:40,042 --> 00:04:43,091
The elections will cost
five billion dollars

39
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:45,127
814 million voters

40
00:04:45,542 --> 00:04:47,260
9 million polling booths

41
00:04:47,542 --> 00:04:52,628
We break our own records
with every new election

42
00:04:54,042 --> 00:04:55,635
We've proved it

43
00:04:56,292 --> 00:04:59,262
Although some rogues get elected
to parliament...

44
00:04:59,792 --> 00:05:03,592
...we will not allow gangster tactics
in the elections

45
00:05:04,292 --> 00:05:05,214
HOW?

46
00:05:05,417 --> 00:05:11,880
Because we, the election volunteers,
will not let it happen

47
00:05:12,292 --> 00:05:13,384
Very well

48
00:05:13,917 --> 00:05:17,000
That's if we aren't bumped off

49
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:19,511
Who said that?

50
00:05:20,042 --> 00:05:23,342
Stand up! You won't be punished

51
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,507
It's natural to be afraid after
what happened yesterday

52
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:34,127
Only human nature

53
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:40,504
The Maoists have made it clear
they'll boycott the elections

54
00:05:40,917 --> 00:05:46,128
There is only one weapon
to stop them and that is...

55
00:05:46,792 --> 00:05:48,214
...our voting machine

56
00:05:48,917 --> 00:05:52,751
Remember we have only
one aim...

57
00:05:53,167 --> 00:05:56,250
...to hold free and fair elections

58
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:01,006
What if the Maoists attack our
polling booth? What do we do?

59
00:06:01,417 --> 00:06:05,627
Don't play the hero.
Do as they ask

60
00:06:06,167 --> 00:06:08,135
They want the voting machine,
hand it over

61
00:06:08,792 --> 00:06:13,969
We'll cancel the votes and
re-election will be organized

62
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:15,842
Anyone else?

63
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,136
And if they attack on re-election
day?

64
00:06:18,667 --> 00:06:21,750
Then we'll have another
re-election

65
00:06:26,542 --> 00:06:29,512
What if they attack on the
"re-re" election day?

66
00:06:32,167 --> 00:06:33,384
What's your name?

67
00:06:33,667 --> 00:06:34,384
Newton

68
00:06:35,917 --> 00:06:37,009
Newton?

69
00:06:39,042 --> 00:06:41,386
"Apple" Newton?

70
00:06:44,792 --> 00:06:47,762
Newton, what comes after two?

71
00:06:48,917 --> 00:06:50,464
- Three
- After three?

72
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,128
- Four
- After four?

73
00:06:54,792 --> 00:06:56,260
Good boy, sit down

74
00:07:00,667 --> 00:07:02,385
You explained things so well, sir

75
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:03,717
My respects to you, sir

76
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:06,002
Never mind

77
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:21,878
Sir, you made light of
my simple doubt

78
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:26,378
My answer only matched
your question

79
00:07:26,667 --> 00:07:29,841
- Sir, I genuinely wanted...
- Of course, sit down

80
00:07:34,542 --> 00:07:35,634
Newton

81
00:07:36,917 --> 00:07:38,635
Tell me who named you?

82
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:42,251
Was your father a physics teacher?
Your mother's whim?

83
00:07:42,417 --> 00:07:44,761
- Who named you?
- I named myself

84
00:07:45,667 --> 00:07:46,964
Meaning?

85
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:49,089
But why?

86
00:07:49,792 --> 00:07:54,093
My parents named me Nutan (new)
Kumar. Made the school kids laugh

87
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,752
Just like you

88
00:07:57,667 --> 00:07:59,260
Nutan Kumar!

89
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:01,627
So what did you do?

90
00:08:02,292 --> 00:08:05,262
On the class 10 form, I changed "Nu"
to "New," and "tan" to "ton"

91
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:10,084
Changed "Nu" to "New" and "tan"
to "ton"

92
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:15,254
You gave yourself a big name
to live up to

93
00:08:15,667 --> 00:08:17,840
Like you're blowing your
own trumpet

94
00:08:18,792 --> 00:08:22,501
- Testing me again?
- Who am I to test anyone?

95
00:08:23,792 --> 00:08:25,135
Tell me

96
00:08:27,292 --> 00:08:29,590
Do you know how Newton
changed the world?

97
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:31,251
Gravity. Optics

98
00:08:32,542 --> 00:08:35,216
For years you've lived as Newton...

99
00:08:35,417 --> 00:08:36,885
...but forgotten the essential

100
00:08:37,542 --> 00:08:41,376
He leveled all differences.
Ask me how

101
00:08:41,917 --> 00:08:42,713
HOW?

102
00:08:43,167 --> 00:08:45,511
Before Newton, people thought
there were different laws...

103
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:48,378
...for heaven and earth

104
00:08:48,792 --> 00:08:51,636
For church and temple

105
00:08:52,917 --> 00:08:57,377
Different laws for kings
and commoners like us

106
00:08:57,792 --> 00:09:01,751
But at a single stroke,
Newton proved us wrong

107
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:04,716
Nature treats everyone equally

108
00:09:05,167 --> 00:09:10,344
Tycoon Ambani and a tea-seller
jump off a cliff simultaneously

109
00:09:10,792 --> 00:09:14,751
They'll land together
at the same time

110
00:09:15,792 --> 00:09:19,877
Newton proved - for Nature
we're all the same

111
00:09:20,417 --> 00:09:22,340
King or beggar

112
00:09:24,042 --> 00:09:28,718
- Which department are you in?
- Not assigned yet. Still on probation

113
00:09:29,167 --> 00:09:30,840
Why are you on election duty?

114
00:09:31,167 --> 00:09:32,635
I'm a Reserve

115
00:09:34,667 --> 00:09:36,886
Good. Reserves are useful

116
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:40,879
There's always a 12th player
in cricket and football too

117
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:48,501
This place must seem a small town
next to Bhopal

118
00:09:48,792 --> 00:09:52,376
Wherever our son is happy
is fine by us

119
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,627
You're so right

120
00:09:55,542 --> 00:09:58,136
Retirement is better spent with
one's children

121
00:09:58,542 --> 00:10:00,385
You don't look over 60

122
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:04,001
60? I'm just 57

123
00:10:04,417 --> 00:10:08,718
My son forced me to take early
retirement when he got a job

124
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,378
If only all sons were like Nutan

125
00:10:11,792 --> 00:10:13,009
It's Newton

126
00:10:13,292 --> 00:10:16,011
Our daughter Ankita made this

127
00:10:16,667 --> 00:10:19,637
She has always loved to embroider

128
00:10:20,667 --> 00:10:22,340
You won't lose your handkerchiefs
again

129
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:27,631
Our daughter will embroider
your initials on them

130
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:31,003
He keeps losing them

131
00:10:35,292 --> 00:10:37,511
Here she is

132
00:10:40,792 --> 00:10:41,759
How are you?

133
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,631
We're fine. I hope you're well too

134
00:10:49,167 --> 00:10:52,011
Eat something with the chai

135
00:10:52,542 --> 00:10:56,001
- Did Ankita cook them?
- Yes

136
00:10:56,667 --> 00:10:58,761
Please sit

137
00:11:04,417 --> 00:11:06,385
Nutan, have a pakora

138
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,001
Newton

139
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:10,886
My English is very poor

140
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:14,253
Drink up before a fly falls into it

141
00:11:15,667 --> 00:11:18,136
If you want to ask her something,
go ahead

142
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,128
Saving it for after the wedding?

143
00:11:22,667 --> 00:11:25,637
Seen her embroidery,
had pakoras and tea

144
00:11:26,417 --> 00:11:28,590
Nothing left to ask

145
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,460
Let him ask. He has a Masters
in physics

146
00:11:34,167 --> 00:11:36,716
Ask her something, son

147
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,379
- Have you any hobbies?
- I love watching movies

148
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:51,584
- What's your favorite movie?
- "Sweety goes to her in-laws"

149
00:11:58,167 --> 00:11:59,589
Which college did you attend?

150
00:12:00,042 --> 00:12:01,339
I didn't go to college

151
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:04,003
I'd never send her to
that den of rascals

152
00:12:04,542 --> 00:12:07,261
Studying is a ruse for wasting time

153
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:09,752
And after high school?

154
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:13,129
I left in Class 9

155
00:12:15,042 --> 00:12:19,092
- When was that?
- Three years ago

156
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:23,751
How old are you?

157
00:12:24,667 --> 00:12:26,010
Sixteen and a half

158
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,252
She's a minor

159
00:12:37,042 --> 00:12:41,377
Nutan, better that she grows up
at her in-laws

160
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:44,628
- Sit down
- She's underage

161
00:12:45,042 --> 00:12:46,385
Please sit

162
00:12:48,417 --> 00:12:50,840
She's underage

163
00:12:51,042 --> 00:12:54,216
Not for long. Marry her later

164
00:12:55,667 --> 00:12:56,884
Her father is a contractor

165
00:12:57,167 --> 00:13:00,137
You're a government officer.
A life of ease

166
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,629
- Sorry, not interested
- Son, don't say no

167
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:06,845
The dowry is 1 million rupees
cash and a motorcycle

168
00:13:07,042 --> 00:13:08,385
Don't want any of it

169
00:13:08,667 --> 00:13:11,750
Who's giving it to you? I'll take it

170
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:14,215
Talking back to your father

171
00:13:14,542 --> 00:13:15,634
Calm down

172
00:13:15,917 --> 00:13:17,885
I will marry a graduate

173
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,754
Chewing your own degree isn't enough?
Must she have one too?

174
00:13:22,042 --> 00:13:23,510
What's wrong with a college graduate?

175
00:13:23,667 --> 00:13:26,341
Will she massage your
mother's feet?

176
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:29,629
The job has made you deluded

177
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:32,628
Next you'll want to marry a
high caste girl

178
00:13:33,042 --> 00:13:34,760
Too big for your boots

179
00:13:35,042 --> 00:13:36,339
Calm down

180
00:13:36,542 --> 00:13:39,091
I will never marry. Happy?

181
00:13:39,667 --> 00:13:45,754
Try these Bollywood lines
on your office intern

182
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:49,253
I am your father.
You good-for-nothing

183
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,252
- Calm down
- Why?

184
00:13:51,417 --> 00:13:53,886
You've spoilt him rotten

185
00:14:14,792 --> 00:14:17,341
<i>The office atmosphere is peculiar</i>

186
00:14:17,792 --> 00:14:20,966
<i>People play cards, trim their nails</i>

187
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:24,094
<i>They just pass time</i>

188
00:14:24,667 --> 00:14:27,511
<i>No file moves without a bribe</i>

189
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:31,709
<i>Everyone thinks like you at first.
Soon you'll be like them</i>

190
00:14:32,292 --> 00:14:36,877
I'm not there to make money.
A call centre would pay more

191
00:14:37,417 --> 00:14:39,840
I want to make a difference

192
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:49,502
<i>Newton, you know your problem?</i>

193
00:14:52,292 --> 00:14:53,214
My honesty?

194
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:54,592
No

195
00:14:56,417 --> 00:14:58,886
Your arrogance about your honesty

196
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:05,007
<i>Newton, your honesty is not doing
the world a favor</i>

197
00:15:06,042 --> 00:15:07,885
<i>It is expected of you</i>

198
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,583
Honesty makes the heart lighter,
less burdened

199
00:15:12,667 --> 00:15:15,386
The office is closing

200
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:22,211
<i>Keep working with your
honesty intact</i>

201
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:26,880
<i>The country will progress alongside</i>

202
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:52,208
Kamal, here's the ink

203
00:15:52,917 --> 00:15:56,501
...the strip seal, stamp...

204
00:15:56,750 --> 00:16:01,836
...chalk, wax and carbon

205
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:07,961
Here. It's all on this list

206
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:11,629
- Sir, you've forgotten the green seal
- Sorry. Here

207
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:16,755
- The rule book
- No need. I know it by heart

208
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:21,001
He's bright. Don't need to
tell him anything

209
00:16:22,917 --> 00:16:25,261
Kamal Kishore, you look smart

210
00:16:28,292 --> 00:16:29,509
Know how to work it?

211
00:16:30,292 --> 00:16:34,001
We keep the control unit.
The balloting unit is...

212
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:36,503
...is used by the voters

213
00:16:37,917 --> 00:16:40,841
- Know where you're going?
- Booth no. 148

214
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:42,876
Kondanar

215
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,627
Very first elections there

216
00:16:46,667 --> 00:16:48,010
Only 76 voters

217
00:16:48,917 --> 00:16:53,343
No problem, sir. We have a booth
for one voter in Girjungle

218
00:16:53,792 --> 00:16:54,884
Really?

219
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:59,835
This is Dandakaranya,
not Gir jungle

220
00:17:01,792 --> 00:17:03,089
It has a strong Maoist presence

221
00:17:03,417 --> 00:17:06,261
The violence was 6 months ago.
It's under our control now

222
00:17:06,542 --> 00:17:07,964
You'll get full security

223
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:11,959
Two officers and a local BLO
to help you

224
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:14,093
You'll fly by helicopter

225
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:16,093
But I'm deputed to the City Hall?

226
00:17:16,417 --> 00:17:18,385
- Who said so?
- Mr Bansilal

227
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:21,502
Do I make the list? Or does he?

228
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,343
You make the list, ma'am

229
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:27,092
I've just got married.
My wife is pregnant

230
00:17:27,917 --> 00:17:30,887
- I am a heart patient
- A heart patient?

231
00:17:31,542 --> 00:17:33,510
Did you hear that?

232
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:35,627
A heart patient

233
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:38,845
The doctor has told me
not to fly

234
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:42,876
Your medical certificate?

235
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,384
I'll bring it in an hour

236
00:17:44,667 --> 00:17:46,260
No, half an hour

237
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:50,094
Mr Meshram, can someone
from Reserves go?

238
00:17:50,292 --> 00:17:51,464
I'll check, ma'am

239
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:56,714
In the jungle...

240
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:58,468
...logic doesn't work

241
00:18:58,792 --> 00:19:01,090
Only instinct

242
00:19:01,667 --> 00:19:04,090
Didn't 19 people die in
the last election?

243
00:19:04,667 --> 00:19:07,637
Not just here, but throughout
the county

244
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:11,254
Elections are being held here
after years

245
00:19:11,792 --> 00:19:15,376
We'll know the casualties numbers
tomorrow

246
00:19:17,042 --> 00:19:19,340
Sir, there's a river 3-4 km away

247
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:22,344
- Pakistan is up ahead
- Pakistan?

248
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,126
The Maoists

249
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:28,629
Their red flag flew here
till last August

250
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:32,334
Wherever I've been posted,
people have saluted other flags

251
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:35,003
Flags and floggings make nations

252
00:19:35,292 --> 00:19:36,384
Correct

253
00:19:38,167 --> 00:19:40,010
Why do you call the Maoist area
"Pakistan?"

254
00:19:40,542 --> 00:19:41,634
God knows

255
00:19:41,917 --> 00:19:45,251
They called it that before my time.
Enemy means Pakistan

256
00:19:47,417 --> 00:19:49,260
Was this area under
Maoist control?

257
00:19:49,542 --> 00:19:52,216
Now we control it

258
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:55,754
But it's still dangerous.
Land mines everywhere

259
00:19:57,167 --> 00:19:59,511
Mind where you pee

260
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:01,627
Might set off a land mine

261
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,628
Why look at me?
You think I'll pee?

262
00:20:04,917 --> 00:20:06,385
No, I'm just telling you

263
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:13,842
I have diabetes. I might need to go

264
00:20:33,667 --> 00:20:35,260
This is our camp

265
00:20:38,167 --> 00:20:41,137
Don't worry, we're safe here

266
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:43,877
What time do we leave for duty?

267
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:47,629
The Asst. Commandant will
brief you at breakfast

268
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:51,593
That's our mess

269
00:20:52,667 --> 00:20:55,466
Your tent is on that side

270
00:20:57,542 --> 00:20:59,010
Sir, careful

271
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:07,210
Don't wander about at night.
There are scorpions and snakes

272
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:08,842
Mr Newton

273
00:21:31,667 --> 00:21:34,136
Mr Loknath

274
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,379
Shambhu, wake up! Loknath sir

275
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:40,877
Get up! It's 4am

276
00:21:42,542 --> 00:21:45,011
Shambhu, let's go

277
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,719
Got any toothpaste?

278
00:22:04,917 --> 00:22:06,134
Ask when he's coming

279
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,218
He's on his way, sir

280
00:22:12,542 --> 00:22:13,384
Hello, Mr Kumar

281
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:15,377
Atma Singh. Assistant Commandant

282
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:18,002
I'm Newton Kumar

283
00:22:18,292 --> 00:22:19,885
Upper Division Clerk,
Collector's Office

284
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:23,379
Loknath and Shambhu. We're together

285
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:25,502
When do we leave?

286
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:28,386
- Where to?
- Kondanar. For the voting

287
00:22:30,167 --> 00:22:31,635
Voting

288
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,002
You eat eggs?

289
00:22:36,792 --> 00:22:37,634
E9Qs?

290
00:22:51,625 --> 00:22:55,630
Wild fowl eggs. Our hens
are revolutionaries too

291
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:59,129
I had to interrogate them
for hours to get them out

292
00:23:06,042 --> 00:23:09,751
Want some? A tonic for bravery

293
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:23,718
Let's go after breakfast

294
00:23:26,417 --> 00:23:29,751
It's enough that
you've made it this far

295
00:23:30,167 --> 00:23:34,343
It's unsafe beyond here.
My men will get the votes

296
00:23:35,042 --> 00:23:38,125
Ma'am said it's been
quiet for 6 months

297
00:23:39,417 --> 00:23:40,634
Really?

298
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,502
Didn't she tell you...

299
00:23:43,667 --> 00:23:47,251
...about the Maoist operation
that took place 6 months ago?

300
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:54,335
If the area was safe, why are
we playing hide-n-seek here?

301
00:23:58,167 --> 00:24:01,250
This is how elections are
conducted in sensitive areas

302
00:24:01,542 --> 00:24:05,217
I have conducted elections
in Srinagar and Manipur

303
00:24:05,667 --> 00:24:08,011
But I'm the presiding officer

304
00:24:21,167 --> 00:24:24,011
ls the school where we'll
install the booth 8 km away?

305
00:24:24,167 --> 00:24:25,885
That's correct

306
00:24:26,167 --> 00:24:28,386
After the police operation,
the villagers were...

307
00:24:28,542 --> 00:24:31,341
...sent to camps near the city

308
00:24:32,167 --> 00:24:35,376
- It's your area, your call
- Please

309
00:24:36,667 --> 00:24:38,385
Let me do my duty

310
00:24:40,292 --> 00:24:43,466
There are 76 voters
who live around here

311
00:24:43,792 --> 00:24:45,009
Their votes are important

312
00:24:45,167 --> 00:24:49,092
Mr Newton, they don't
care about the elections

313
00:24:49,292 --> 00:24:51,386
They're illiterate villagers

314
00:24:52,292 --> 00:24:55,876
And the Maoists have
ordered them not to vote

315
00:24:56,667 --> 00:25:00,592
I'll give it to you in
writing, no one will vote

316
00:25:12,375 --> 00:25:17,211
Write it down then. I'll submit
it to the Collector's office

317
00:25:28,125 --> 00:25:29,342
Jayesh!

318
00:25:31,417 --> 00:25:32,760
Bulletproof jacket

319
00:25:39,167 --> 00:25:40,589
Let's hurry

320
00:26:02,042 --> 00:26:07,003
Government goods. Tie it tight,
that's if you want to live

321
00:26:15,667 --> 00:26:16,634
Who is this?

322
00:26:17,167 --> 00:26:18,635
Sir, she's the BLO

323
00:26:21,167 --> 00:26:22,339
How did she get inside?

324
00:26:22,542 --> 00:26:23,634
How did she?

325
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:28,003
She's one of our team

326
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,877
Checked her ID?

327
00:26:35,417 --> 00:26:36,259
Your name?

328
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,218
Malko. Malko Netam

329
00:26:38,625 --> 00:26:40,377
- You can't come with us
- What?

330
00:26:40,542 --> 00:26:43,967
- She must. She's a team member
- I decide that

331
00:26:44,292 --> 00:26:46,010
You're not coming. Go.

332
00:26:46,375 --> 00:26:49,379
The rule says a BLO
has to be present.

333
00:26:49,542 --> 00:26:50,759
You're coming

334
00:26:54,417 --> 00:26:57,591
You don't get it. You
can't trust the locals

335
00:26:58,042 --> 00:26:59,134
You don't get it

336
00:27:00,167 --> 00:27:03,842
She's in our team.
She's coming with us

337
00:27:08,375 --> 00:27:12,084
- Do we give her a BP jacket?
- Yes

338
00:27:12,375 --> 00:27:16,084
Yashwant! A bulletproof
jacket for madam

339
00:27:17,292 --> 00:27:18,259
I don't want it

340
00:27:18,417 --> 00:27:19,634
It's safer

341
00:27:20,042 --> 00:27:24,127
I'm a local. I'm safer without one

342
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:27,376
Take mine off then

343
00:27:27,542 --> 00:27:30,011
No. You're not a local

344
00:27:32,042 --> 00:27:34,215
- You have the voters list?
- Yes

345
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:37,504
- Is it updated?
- The best I could do

346
00:27:39,167 --> 00:27:40,635
You have copies?

347
00:27:42,167 --> 00:27:46,343
Hemant, give them their crowns

348
00:27:46,542 --> 00:27:48,010
Crowns?

349
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:49,510
Helmets

350
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,377
Must we?

351
00:27:51,625 --> 00:27:55,505
You'll walk in the centre.
The boys will spread out

352
00:27:57,292 --> 00:27:58,635
Let's go

353
00:29:05,917 --> 00:29:06,839
What is it?

354
00:29:40,292 --> 00:29:41,635
Get up!

355
00:30:05,125 --> 00:30:06,251
Sir

356
00:30:06,667 --> 00:30:08,635
- I have to go
- That's what we're doing

357
00:30:08,917 --> 00:30:10,965
I mean I need to take a dump

358
00:30:11,667 --> 00:30:13,260
Why didn't you go at the camp?

359
00:30:13,625 --> 00:30:17,380
I'm unlucky. I have to
work hard for small rewards

360
00:30:17,542 --> 00:30:19,510
A bunch of clowns

361
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:22,593
Let him go, it's an emergency

362
00:30:22,792 --> 00:30:24,385
Let me help

363
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:29,626
Do I look like a
kid who needs help?

364
00:30:30,042 --> 00:30:30,634
Halt!

365
00:30:44,917 --> 00:30:46,885
How many times will you go?

366
00:30:48,042 --> 00:30:51,012
A yogi goes once, a pleasure-seeker
twice. The ailing goes 3 times

367
00:30:51,167 --> 00:30:52,259
What are you, sir?

368
00:30:52,667 --> 00:30:54,385
A pleasure-seeker

369
00:31:00,167 --> 00:31:05,378
Leave me alone. A
little privacy, please

370
00:31:24,375 --> 00:31:26,127
What can I say?

371
00:31:27,292 --> 00:31:30,626
- He was on the phone all night
- Talking to the girlfriend?

372
00:31:39,625 --> 00:31:42,879
Lakhma, where are they going?

373
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:45,628
To gather Tendu leaves

374
00:31:46,125 --> 00:31:46,842
Bring them here

375
00:31:47,042 --> 00:31:49,010
Get their votes

376
00:31:49,917 --> 00:31:53,217
No, it doesn't work like
that. Voting has rules

377
00:31:53,542 --> 00:31:55,886
Without voter cards,
they can't vote

378
00:31:56,167 --> 00:31:58,761
Lakhma, ask them if
they have voter cards

379
00:32:06,167 --> 00:32:07,339
Listen

380
00:32:08,125 --> 00:32:10,093
Do you know it is election day?

381
00:32:10,667 --> 00:32:12,010
You know about the elections?

382
00:32:12,167 --> 00:32:13,510
Yes, we know

383
00:32:13,792 --> 00:32:17,342
We'll set up the booth at the
Kondanar School. Come there

384
00:32:17,542 --> 00:32:18,509
We'll come

385
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:20,752
You must all come

386
00:32:21,667 --> 00:32:23,886
- Does everyone have a voter card?
- Yes

387
00:32:24,042 --> 00:32:26,511
Bring them with you. Don't forget

388
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,093
We'll wait there. You must come

389
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:30,252
Rajman, explain it in Gondi

390
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:43,378
- They might not show up
- Why not?

391
00:32:43,875 --> 00:32:48,005
They were told in Gondi
that voting stops at 11 :30am

392
00:32:48,292 --> 00:32:49,885
Wait!

393
00:32:51,667 --> 00:32:54,261
Voting stops at 3pm, not 11.30

394
00:32:54,917 --> 00:32:57,090
Come anytime before that

395
00:32:57,417 --> 00:32:58,885
You must come

396
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:02,129
By 3. Not 11:30. Please translate

397
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:09,128
Your man was lying to them

398
00:33:09,417 --> 00:33:12,136
Where is your old man?

399
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:14,251
What happened?

400
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:17,128
Six voters came but Newton
did not take their votes

401
00:33:17,375 --> 00:33:18,718
How could I?

402
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:23,379
6 out of 76 voters showed up.
That's a 7.5% turnout

403
00:33:23,625 --> 00:33:25,343
How was your turnout?

404
00:33:25,542 --> 00:33:28,136
Thanks to you, it was 100%

405
00:33:36,417 --> 00:33:38,761
Did you play cricket as a kid?

406
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:41,717
Yes

407
00:33:43,167 --> 00:33:45,261
Batsman, or bowler?

408
00:33:46,667 --> 00:33:47,919
Umpire

409
00:33:47,917 --> 00:33:49,760
Thought as much

410
00:33:51,042 --> 00:33:54,376
What's your opinion of the Maoists?

411
00:33:56,667 --> 00:34:00,001
No opinion. That's
why they sent me here

412
00:34:00,292 --> 00:34:01,464
Good

413
00:34:01,917 --> 00:34:06,002
You're intelligent. Why didn't
you sit for the civil service exam?

414
00:34:06,292 --> 00:34:10,217
- I did, but I failed
- Thought as much

415
00:34:12,042 --> 00:34:14,215
Do you know the
capital of Nagaland?

416
00:34:14,417 --> 00:34:15,259
Kohima

417
00:34:15,417 --> 00:34:17,385
- Manipur?
- lmphal

418
00:34:17,625 --> 00:34:20,003
- Kashmir?
- Srinagar

419
00:34:20,417 --> 00:34:22,260
Seen any of those cities?

420
00:34:22,542 --> 00:34:23,714
No

421
00:34:24,292 --> 00:34:25,635
Listen

422
00:34:27,375 --> 00:34:28,752
lhave

423
00:34:33,792 --> 00:34:35,840
Hold it

424
00:34:39,167 --> 00:34:40,384
Heavy, right?

425
00:34:42,917 --> 00:34:47,969
The nation's burden.
It's on our shoulders

426
00:34:52,375 --> 00:34:53,877
Keep moving

427
00:34:56,417 --> 00:34:58,010
Wait

428
00:34:58,917 --> 00:35:04,629
I'm the only one asking
questions in this jungle. OK?

429
00:35:08,167 --> 00:35:11,626
Sir, are you related to
some government big shot?

430
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,751
No

431
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,753
You must know someone influential

432
00:35:16,167 --> 00:35:16,963
No, why?

433
00:35:17,167 --> 00:35:18,464
Sure you do

434
00:35:18,667 --> 00:35:23,377
No one has the guts to talk
to a police officer like that

435
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:26,629
Tell me. Am I right?

436
00:35:29,542 --> 00:35:32,591
I won't tell anyone

437
00:35:34,417 --> 00:35:35,760
Keep walking

438
00:36:47,917 --> 00:36:50,261
Mr Atma Singh

439
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:53,511
Who burned their homes?

440
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,959
- The villagers are safe in camps
- Who set the village on fire?

441
00:36:58,167 --> 00:37:02,968
Does it matter? There's
peace. Everything is in control

442
00:37:03,625 --> 00:37:06,253
Whose idea was it to do this?

443
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:11,256
You're here for the elections.
Do your research later

444
00:37:11,542 --> 00:37:15,877
This is the school. Lakhma,
put everything inside

445
00:37:18,167 --> 00:37:19,885
Put it inside

446
00:37:24,792 --> 00:37:28,626
Oh God! What is this place?

447
00:37:38,417 --> 00:37:39,634
What is this?

448
00:37:42,125 --> 00:37:46,130
How can we conduct elections
here? Didn't you survey the place?

449
00:37:46,375 --> 00:37:47,501
Yes

450
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,719
I described it accurately

451
00:37:56,542 --> 00:38:01,378
Well, we can't set up here

452
00:38:04,417 --> 00:38:05,839
As per the rule book...

453
00:38:06,042 --> 00:38:09,342
...the presiding officer can
conduct elections anywhere

454
00:38:10,667 --> 00:38:12,590
I told you not to come

455
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:16,260
Let's have tea and head back

456
00:38:16,417 --> 00:38:19,387
Lakhma! Tea for everyone

457
00:38:20,375 --> 00:38:23,879
Sir, this way? Please

458
00:38:25,875 --> 00:38:29,129
I am 59. You made me run 8 kms.

459
00:38:29,417 --> 00:38:32,751
I have diabetes, asthma.
My cholesterol is high

460
00:38:33,042 --> 00:38:35,465
Will you make me run back?

461
00:38:36,375 --> 00:38:40,084
If we have a good
breakfast, it'll help

462
00:38:42,292 --> 00:38:46,968
No one cares if
elections are held or not

463
00:39:16,375 --> 00:39:19,003
Did the Maoists write this?

464
00:39:22,125 --> 00:39:25,095
If you burn their
homes, anger is natural

465
00:39:35,375 --> 00:39:37,503
Sir, what shall we do?

466
00:39:40,625 --> 00:39:43,219
Decide soon, please

467
00:39:52,417 --> 00:39:54,010
Where shall I put all this?

468
00:39:59,417 --> 00:40:00,384
Take it out

469
00:40:01,375 --> 00:40:04,254
Clear it all away. Let's make do.

470
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:08,343
Decide the entry and exit

471
00:40:08,625 --> 00:40:11,378
They enter here. Here's your table

472
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:13,593
Put a table here

473
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,752
Let's follow the rules

474
00:40:16,292 --> 00:40:17,760
Listen to me

475
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:22,378
- The entry is always to the left
- Why not here?

476
00:40:23,375 --> 00:40:25,127
Keep the booth here!

477
00:40:27,667 --> 00:40:29,010
And my table here

478
00:40:29,167 --> 00:40:32,626
- Mr Loknath, show me
- How many times must I?

479
00:40:33,542 --> 00:40:37,001
- Oh no! These mosquitoes...
- Get to the point

480
00:40:37,292 --> 00:40:39,761
The voters walk this way

481
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,753
They come to me. Then to him

482
00:40:43,667 --> 00:40:45,761
They press the button

483
00:40:45,917 --> 00:40:48,136
Twirl their moustache
proudly and go

484
00:41:31,917 --> 00:41:33,885
Nabi, you're on sentry duty

485
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,468
- You're on OP duty
- Ok, sir

486
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,217
- Clear, everyone?
- Yes, sir

487
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:37,343
He's coming out

488
00:42:55,292 --> 00:42:56,009
Yes?

489
00:42:56,375 --> 00:42:59,219
Acting all friendly now

490
00:43:06,167 --> 00:43:07,885
What does your name mean?

491
00:43:10,542 --> 00:43:14,126
- Malko means playful
- Playful?

492
00:43:15,542 --> 00:43:18,751
You're a teacher,
right? What do you teach?

493
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,219
I teach young kids. So everything

494
00:43:21,792 --> 00:43:23,009
Do you like teaching?

495
00:43:25,042 --> 00:43:28,751
It's not easy. The
children speak Gondi

496
00:43:29,125 --> 00:43:31,503
And the textbooks are in Hindi

497
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:35,003
I try my best to explain in Gondi

498
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:37,594
They don't understand the textbooks

499
00:43:38,125 --> 00:43:40,969
Anyway Hindi is outdated

500
00:43:41,875 --> 00:43:45,379
I was educated in Hindi,
and now see what I'm doing?

501
00:43:45,792 --> 00:43:47,385
Teach them English. English

502
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:49,878
Even puppies know English today

503
00:43:50,125 --> 00:43:51,251
Do you speak English?

504
00:43:52,167 --> 00:43:53,384
I'm learning

505
00:43:53,542 --> 00:43:54,509
Adult education?

506
00:43:55,542 --> 00:43:59,001
Adult? No, sir.
Watching films in English

507
00:43:59,542 --> 00:44:01,260
On my phone

508
00:44:01,875 --> 00:44:05,254
<i>Return of Dracula, Bride
of Chucky, Seed of Chucky</i>

509
00:44:05,542 --> 00:44:06,384
Brainy phone

510
00:44:07,917 --> 00:44:09,635
It's Chinese. It has everything

511
00:44:10,167 --> 00:44:12,386
- Are you married?
- No

512
00:44:12,917 --> 00:44:13,884
And you?

513
00:44:14,292 --> 00:44:15,384
Good

514
00:44:17,292 --> 00:44:18,009
YOU?

515
00:44:18,417 --> 00:44:21,091
In '83, I was going
to have a love marriage

516
00:44:21,667 --> 00:44:25,001
If her father hadn't
made such a big fuss...

517
00:44:25,542 --> 00:44:27,636
...I would've had three kids by now

518
00:44:28,125 --> 00:44:30,878
Love marriages were
not the fashion then

519
00:44:31,167 --> 00:44:33,590
Kamla was married
off to a rich old man

520
00:44:33,875 --> 00:44:34,876
That's terrible

521
00:44:35,167 --> 00:44:36,259
No, sir

522
00:44:38,375 --> 00:44:40,343
She's a rich widow now

523
00:44:41,042 --> 00:44:42,134
Doesn't care about me

524
00:44:42,417 --> 00:44:47,127
But I'm a writer. If I didn't
suffer, how would I write?

525
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:49,502
- A writer?
- Yes

526
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:52,003
- What are you writing?
- Jungle stories

527
00:44:53,167 --> 00:44:56,137
A polling party come to
the jungle for the elections

528
00:44:56,417 --> 00:44:58,385
But they can't go home

529
00:44:59,292 --> 00:45:00,134
Why not?

530
00:45:00,375 --> 00:45:05,381
The forest people who died
years ago are now Jombies

531
00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:06,876
Zombies

532
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:10,379
Jombies. Bloodthirsty,
the living dead

533
00:45:10,792 --> 00:45:11,964
Rotting corpses

534
00:45:12,542 --> 00:45:13,384
Like the plot?

535
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:14,751
Dreadful

536
00:45:16,417 --> 00:45:18,715
Those films have
corrupted your imagination

537
00:45:20,667 --> 00:45:26,595
"When Samina heard about
Ramju, fear gripped her heart

538
00:45:27,375 --> 00:45:29,343
"She had never seen him

539
00:45:29,542 --> 00:45:33,376
"But every scary face
reminded her of him

540
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:36,720
"One day she finally met Ramju

541
00:45:36,917 --> 00:45:40,842
"She was buying mangoes
at the bus stop...

542
00:45:41,167 --> 00:45:46,503
"...a young man in a white
shirt stopped near the stall

543
00:45:46,875 --> 00:45:50,334
"His face was all
scared from knife cuts

544
00:46:00,292 --> 00:46:03,262
Mr Loknath, put them
away. Not allowed

545
00:46:03,417 --> 00:46:06,466
It's an old custom
playing cards at the booth

546
00:46:07,167 --> 00:46:08,714
So is getting suspended

547
00:46:09,417 --> 00:46:12,500
Another old custom:
fortune-telling. May I?

548
00:46:15,792 --> 00:46:16,759
Cut the deck.

549
00:46:17,667 --> 00:46:20,136
Go on. Don't be scared

550
00:46:20,375 --> 00:46:22,218
Let's see your future

551
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:26,128
- Not on my table
- Please wait

552
00:46:26,667 --> 00:46:28,340
1,2,3

553
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:30,502
This card is your past

554
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,719
This is your present.
And this is your future

555
00:46:34,042 --> 00:46:37,751
- Choose one
- What are you doing?

556
00:46:39,042 --> 00:46:42,501
Two of Hearts, you're
kind-hearted Pick another

557
00:46:45,042 --> 00:46:46,385
The joker

558
00:46:46,792 --> 00:46:48,214
That's you today

559
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:50,126
A joker?

560
00:46:50,417 --> 00:46:54,217
Ajoker could be anyone

561
00:46:55,167 --> 00:46:56,339
Enough!

562
00:46:56,750 --> 00:46:58,218
Go and sit down

563
00:46:59,125 --> 00:47:03,255
Sure! Prophecies frighten people

564
00:47:03,417 --> 00:47:05,010
Put the cards away

565
00:47:07,542 --> 00:47:08,839
Shambhu! Get up

566
00:47:09,917 --> 00:47:11,385
Go and freshen up

567
00:47:18,125 --> 00:47:19,251
Matches?

568
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:36,384
20 rupees

569
00:47:38,667 --> 00:47:40,465
20? Wow!

570
00:47:41,542 --> 00:47:43,260
You must have a good hand

571
00:47:43,792 --> 00:47:45,009
20 from me

572
00:47:45,292 --> 00:47:47,010
No, friends

573
00:47:48,167 --> 00:47:49,760
What have you got?

574
00:47:53,750 --> 00:47:56,754
There's nothing to do
here. Just kill time

575
00:48:02,292 --> 00:48:06,251
- What's the price of land here?
- Why? Building a house?

576
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:07,876
I want to invest

577
00:48:08,375 --> 00:48:10,753
- Surrender instead
- Surrender?

578
00:48:11,042 --> 00:48:14,125
Turn yourself in with a pistol,
you'll get 200,000 rupees

579
00:48:14,750 --> 00:48:18,880
Surrender with this,
you'll get 500,000

580
00:48:19,167 --> 00:48:22,341
With an AK-47, it's
1.5 million rupees

581
00:48:23,167 --> 00:48:28,253
You find the guns. We'll
do the rest and split 50-50

582
00:48:28,667 --> 00:48:30,010
But I am not a Maoist

583
00:48:30,292 --> 00:48:33,216
The police know that.
That's why they'll pay you

584
00:48:34,667 --> 00:48:37,876
- Freshened up? It was quick
- No choice

585
00:48:38,542 --> 00:48:41,386
- You should've washed your clothes too
- There was no soap

586
00:48:41,750 --> 00:48:43,752
You washed your face without soap?

587
00:48:44,042 --> 00:48:46,465
You could've used the
leaves of the Ritha tree

588
00:48:46,667 --> 00:48:48,010
Didn't see it

589
00:48:48,375 --> 00:48:49,501
Lakhma

590
00:48:51,292 --> 00:48:52,839
Where is Mr Atma Singh?

591
00:48:55,667 --> 00:48:59,592
- Where is Mr Atma Singh?
- On a field exercise

592
00:49:11,250 --> 00:49:12,968
Great catch!

593
00:49:14,542 --> 00:49:17,011
You'll have to run a kilometer

594
00:49:17,292 --> 00:49:18,885
How far are the settlements?

595
00:49:19,542 --> 00:49:22,091
Shubham, help this gentleman

596
00:49:23,792 --> 00:49:29,344
One is behind the hill,
1.5km. The other is 1km away

597
00:49:32,417 --> 00:49:35,466
They aren't showing up
because of the boycott

598
00:49:35,875 --> 00:49:38,344
Can you bring the
voters here safely?

599
00:49:38,667 --> 00:49:40,965
- That's impossible
- Why?

600
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:45,129
I am the presiding officer.
You must obey my orders

601
00:49:45,417 --> 00:49:52,756
Yes, within 200m. Not beyond
that. We have our procedures too

602
00:49:53,417 --> 00:49:54,760
Hey Rajman

603
00:49:57,667 --> 00:49:58,463
No, thanks

604
00:49:58,875 --> 00:50:00,718
It's nothing personal

605
00:50:01,792 --> 00:50:03,965
Worried about zero voting?
I won't let that happen

606
00:50:04,625 --> 00:50:06,218
My men will vote

607
00:50:06,542 --> 00:50:07,714
Who wants to vote?

608
00:50:08,667 --> 00:50:12,092
See? They are all keen

609
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:17,253
Is that your idea? I
won't allow any cheating

610
00:50:17,792 --> 00:50:19,339
You talk about cheating

611
00:50:20,125 --> 00:50:21,877
There are almost 70
voters in these villages

612
00:50:22,125 --> 00:50:24,469
Politicians? Not even
a polling agent has come

613
00:50:24,792 --> 00:50:28,126
No one from any Party.
And you talk about cheating

614
00:50:30,167 --> 00:50:33,137
I don't know about that.
I'm just doing my duty

615
00:50:33,417 --> 00:50:35,761
How old are you? I'm 40. And you?

616
00:50:36,292 --> 00:50:37,714
What's that got to do with it?

617
00:50:39,167 --> 00:50:40,635
Just changing the subject

618
00:50:42,917 --> 00:50:43,588
<i>OK</i>

619
00:50:44,917 --> 00:50:49,844
What is <i>2</i> plus 2, divided by 2?

620
00:50:51,417 --> 00:50:52,384
TWO?

621
00:50:53,792 --> 00:50:54,759
Three

622
00:50:55,167 --> 00:50:57,590
You talk of rules and
forget the basic one

623
00:50:58,417 --> 00:51:00,761
Division comes before addition

624
00:51:06,167 --> 00:51:07,089
You won't send your men?

625
00:51:08,667 --> 00:51:11,261
Sorry. Rules

626
00:51:21,250 --> 00:51:24,094
Mr Newton, do you
have a motorcycle?

627
00:51:25,125 --> 00:51:25,967
No

628
00:51:26,167 --> 00:51:28,966
I'm buying one next month. A Honda

629
00:51:29,167 --> 00:51:31,886
Can I ask you something? Don't mind

630
00:51:32,375 --> 00:51:33,501
Go on

631
00:51:34,042 --> 00:51:40,379
Say you work the same hours,
but your salary doubles

632
00:51:42,042 --> 00:51:43,259
I don't take bribes

633
00:51:43,625 --> 00:51:46,003
You've got me wrong,
sir. There's a scheme

634
00:51:46,292 --> 00:51:48,715
Pay 500 rupees

635
00:51:48,917 --> 00:51:52,626
Then find ten others
who pay 500 each

636
00:51:53,167 --> 00:51:58,503
You'll earn more with every
new member. A chain is created

637
00:51:58,750 --> 00:52:00,752
You'll mint money, sitting at home

638
00:52:01,042 --> 00:52:06,003
The scheme guys will explain
everything over a free lunch

639
00:52:06,542 --> 00:52:08,510
Chicken and all sorts are served

640
00:52:08,875 --> 00:52:13,130
A lady from Sukma bought
a Sony phone in two months

641
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:14,877
The touchscreen type

642
00:52:15,917 --> 00:52:17,760
We are all doing our duty

643
00:52:18,417 --> 00:52:20,761
Atma Singh must have
seen other elections

644
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,343
But these are different

645
00:52:22,667 --> 00:52:24,214
I understand that

646
00:52:24,542 --> 00:52:27,136
Guys like him don't shake
without being shaken...

647
00:52:27,375 --> 00:52:31,255
...but they don't stop once
shaken. He is a Jombie now

648
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,092
Must I do nothing?

649
00:52:33,292 --> 00:52:35,761
Let's none of us do anything

650
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:43,006
I've sprayed tons of repellent
but these bloodsuckers won't stop

651
00:52:43,917 --> 00:52:45,260
I'm shivering

652
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:49,380
They're local bloodsuckers.
Repellent is useless

653
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:51,001
Try our remedy

654
00:52:52,542 --> 00:52:53,384
What?

655
00:52:53,917 --> 00:52:55,134
You won't get malaria

656
00:52:56,167 --> 00:52:58,511
Will you make me eat herbs?

657
00:52:59,042 --> 00:53:03,502
He had better not get cerebral
malaria. What's your remedy?

658
00:53:04,417 --> 00:53:05,714
No, sir

659
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,627
The bites will soon disappear

660
00:53:08,042 --> 00:53:09,840
What is she doing?

661
00:53:12,792 --> 00:53:14,135
Must he chew the leaves?

662
00:53:14,292 --> 00:53:17,136
An ant's nest. The
ants must bite him

663
00:53:17,292 --> 00:53:18,384
- Bite whom?
- You

664
00:53:19,875 --> 00:53:22,879
They'll bite you and you'll
sweat. You won't get malaria

665
00:53:23,125 --> 00:53:24,718
Pull up your shirt

666
00:53:24,917 --> 00:53:27,841
No, no. I'm already
sweating. Sir, stop her!

667
00:53:28,167 --> 00:53:31,501
- A few bites and you'll be ok
- It'll save you from malaria

668
00:53:32,667 --> 00:53:33,589
It won't hurt

669
00:53:42,667 --> 00:53:44,510
Are they edible?

670
00:53:53,667 --> 00:53:55,590
It's sour

671
00:53:56,792 --> 00:53:59,511
We make them into a
chutney. Very tasty

672
00:54:00,042 --> 00:54:01,089
Interesting

673
00:54:01,417 --> 00:54:04,842
What's interesting is that
you live a few hours away...

674
00:54:05,042 --> 00:54:07,636
...yet know nothing about life here

675
00:54:11,542 --> 00:54:13,215
Is that someone singing?

676
00:54:30,542 --> 00:54:33,341
- What's going on?
- Interrogation

677
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:36,342
About what?

678
00:54:42,292 --> 00:54:43,635
They were climbing trees, playing

679
00:54:43,917 --> 00:54:47,126
They were spying to
see how many men we were

680
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:51,130
"How many men?" You think you're
in an action movie like "Sholay?"

681
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:54,583
The Maoists even use toddlers

682
00:54:55,917 --> 00:54:57,009
Not true

683
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:59,002
Who's asking you?

684
00:54:59,667 --> 00:55:02,011
- You're one of them
- One second

685
00:55:02,917 --> 00:55:04,134
You can't talk to her like that

686
00:55:06,625 --> 00:55:07,968
If they're spies,
why make them sing?

687
00:55:10,250 --> 00:55:12,503
You prefer I beat them up?

688
00:55:14,667 --> 00:55:16,965
- Ask them if they saw anything
- No

689
00:55:17,375 --> 00:55:20,003
Hear that? The answer
came out like a shot

690
00:55:20,417 --> 00:55:22,465
Pretends he doesn't speak Hindi

691
00:55:22,667 --> 00:55:24,385
Hey Mowgli, come here

692
00:55:31,417 --> 00:55:32,634
What are you doing?

693
00:55:33,792 --> 00:55:34,759
Go!

694
00:55:35,125 --> 00:55:38,254
Tell everyone in the
village to come and vote. Go

695
00:55:50,292 --> 00:55:52,090
It's all for your benefit, sir

696
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:55,252
You sound threatening

697
00:55:56,792 --> 00:55:57,884
Mr Newton...

698
00:56:01,167 --> 00:56:05,377
In uniform, a request
sounds like a threat

699
00:56:07,542 --> 00:56:08,589
They aren't your slaves

700
00:56:12,417 --> 00:56:14,886
Newton, stay a Newton

701
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:18,753
Don't try to be an Einstein

702
00:56:19,375 --> 00:56:21,377
We're leaving soon

703
00:56:22,792 --> 00:56:25,762
More ambushes at night.
Get back to your duty

704
00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:35,751
Let's go

705
00:56:53,917 --> 00:56:56,636
What time did we
first meet Atma Singh?

706
00:56:57,417 --> 00:57:01,752
- Around 4:30 or 4:45 am
- 4:30 or 4:45?

707
00:57:02,667 --> 00:57:04,761
Probably 4:45

708
00:57:06,917 --> 00:57:08,510
When did we leave?

709
00:57:10,167 --> 00:57:11,259
Don't know

710
00:57:12,750 --> 00:57:14,127
I got there at 5:30

711
00:57:17,292 --> 00:57:18,760
Are you filing a complaint?

712
00:57:19,292 --> 00:57:20,839
Why raise your blood pressure?

713
00:57:21,167 --> 00:57:24,250
We know the elections
mean a lot to you

714
00:57:24,542 --> 00:57:29,719
But only one thing changes: the
framed portraits of our leaders

715
00:57:31,042 --> 00:57:37,129
Who cares if people starve or not,
voting is a more important right!

716
00:57:43,792 --> 00:57:45,089
Are you a pessimist like him?

717
00:57:47,625 --> 00:57:50,128
No. I'm an Adivasi, a "tribal"

718
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,126
What's going on?

719
00:58:46,875 --> 00:58:47,876
Go back to duty

720
00:58:48,667 --> 00:58:50,886
Run!

721
00:58:54,625 --> 00:58:56,093
What a pain

722
00:59:22,542 --> 00:59:26,092
How did you end up in this
jungle? Couldn't pull any strings?

723
00:59:26,375 --> 00:59:28,127
I wanted to sit in a helicopter

724
00:59:28,667 --> 00:59:31,261
- Mr Newton, Digcent is on the line
- Who?

725
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:32,626
The DIG, sir

726
00:59:41,625 --> 00:59:42,467
Newton Kumar

727
00:59:43,542 --> 00:59:44,634
How many votes?

728
00:59:45,875 --> 00:59:47,001
Zero votes

729
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:51,504
It's not going well.
I tried telling Atma...

730
00:59:51,750 --> 00:59:54,754
Hello. Listen to me.
The voters will come

731
00:59:55,167 --> 00:59:56,714
<i>I spoke to Atma Singh</i>

732
00:59:57,167 --> 00:59:59,010
<i>I'm on my way...</i>

733
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,718
...with some foreign journalists

734
01:00:01,917 --> 01:00:04,636
Remember, my reputation
is at stake Clear?

735
01:00:09,375 --> 01:00:11,377
Your WhatsApp profile is good

736
01:00:11,625 --> 01:00:13,002
I thought you were blonde

737
01:00:13,792 --> 01:00:17,626
Krishna's unit will go down the hill.
My men will go the other way

738
01:00:18,917 --> 01:00:21,261
Mr Newton, may we go?

739
01:00:23,625 --> 01:00:28,131
Don't force anyone to come.
Let them come voluntarily

740
01:00:28,792 --> 01:00:32,001
Force them? Tell us and
we'll leave our guns here

741
01:00:42,750 --> 01:00:44,627
One unit stays here
to protect the booth

742
01:01:52,667 --> 01:01:53,509
Get up!

743
01:01:55,167 --> 01:01:55,963
Move it

744
01:01:56,792 --> 01:02:00,877
Stop listening to their excuses.
Get them together in 5 minutes

745
01:02:06,542 --> 01:02:09,876
Where are you going? Fill it up

746
01:02:11,292 --> 01:02:12,509
Hurry UP!

747
01:02:17,250 --> 01:02:20,504
- Do you know Hindi?
- A little

748
01:02:21,292 --> 01:02:24,011
How many villagers
have voting cards?

749
01:02:27,125 --> 01:02:29,503
- What's that?
- He says "40"

750
01:02:30,292 --> 01:02:33,501
Tell him to bring his card
and convince the others. OK?

751
01:02:40,542 --> 01:02:42,385
Do you have a voting card?

752
01:02:42,667 --> 01:02:44,135
Card? Go and get it

753
01:02:44,417 --> 01:02:46,966
Cook the fat one. Make it spicy.

754
01:02:47,417 --> 01:02:49,010
Do you have a voting card?

755
01:02:54,792 --> 01:02:55,714
Come on!

756
01:03:00,625 --> 01:03:01,626
Stop!

757
01:03:23,042 --> 01:03:25,886
We're taking the voters with us

758
01:03:35,292 --> 01:03:36,134
Get going!

759
01:03:40,875 --> 01:03:43,094
Do you know the
history of this place?

760
01:03:44,917 --> 01:03:46,260
Dandakaranya Forest

761
01:03:46,917 --> 01:03:48,385
Know what it means?

762
01:03:48,375 --> 01:03:53,632
"The Forest of Punishment."
Where it's given and served

763
01:03:54,042 --> 01:03:56,886
Sita and Rama were exiled here

764
01:03:57,125 --> 01:03:59,344
Surpanakha's nose was cut off here

765
01:03:59,542 --> 01:04:02,011
Sita crossed the
line drawn by Lakshman

766
01:04:02,292 --> 01:04:06,377
She was kidnapped by Ravan
and taken to Sri Lanka

767
01:04:06,667 --> 01:04:08,135
Lots of history here

768
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:12,960
You are too young to have
seen the TV serial Ramayana

769
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:16,344
The mythical aircraft,
Pushpak? It flew from here

770
01:04:17,042 --> 01:04:21,127
- From here?
- Yes. See that clearing?

771
01:04:21,542 --> 01:04:23,636
Doesn't it look like a runway?

772
01:04:24,167 --> 01:04:26,511
India's first pilot was Ravan

773
01:04:27,417 --> 01:04:28,384
Of Sri Lanka?

774
01:04:28,667 --> 01:04:31,386
Sri Lanka and India were
the same country then

775
01:04:31,542 --> 01:04:35,126
He flew her straight to Sri Lanka

776
01:04:54,125 --> 01:04:55,342
What are you staring at?

777
01:05:44,167 --> 01:05:47,751
People with a voting
card, raise your hands

778
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:56,378
The ones with the card, go
over there. Only they can vote

779
01:06:00,667 --> 01:06:01,964
Where are the young?

780
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:04,127
Gone to pick Tendu leaves

781
01:06:04,417 --> 01:06:06,385
- When will they be back?

782
01:06:06,792 --> 01:06:08,009
Sit over there

783
01:06:29,667 --> 01:06:31,510
They're all old. Where
are the young ones?

784
01:06:33,625 --> 01:06:35,593
They've gone to work

785
01:06:36,292 --> 01:06:37,760
We found this lot, so
we dragged them here

786
01:06:38,167 --> 01:06:39,760
- Dragged them here?
- No, sir

787
01:06:40,375 --> 01:06:43,128
They came voluntarily.
The others have been informed.

788
01:06:43,375 --> 01:06:44,718
They'll come after lunch

789
01:06:47,750 --> 01:06:49,377
Get in line

790
01:06:49,917 --> 01:06:52,466
Everyone, in line. Hurry

791
01:06:58,917 --> 01:07:00,635
Malko, Loknath. Shall we start?

792
01:07:01,167 --> 01:07:02,885
Go ahead, start

793
01:07:10,875 --> 01:07:11,967
Name?

794
01:07:12,167 --> 01:07:14,135

795
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,094

798
01:07:37,250 --> 01:07:38,593
What's her name?

01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:41,592
Komaldai

800
01:07:56,500 --> 01:07:57,501
Number 19

801
01:08:05,042 --> 01:08:05,884
Cast your vote

802
01:08:11,042 --> 01:08:11,713
What?

803
01:08:12,667 --> 01:08:13,714
He's just standing there

804
01:08:14,542 --> 01:08:16,715
Maybe it's the first
time he's seen a machine

805
01:08:17,667 --> 01:08:19,715
Nor have his ancestors!

806
01:08:20,667 --> 01:08:21,759
He's dumbstruck

807
01:08:25,375 --> 01:08:26,877
Listen to me carefully

808
01:08:27,875 --> 01:08:30,378
Cast your votes, one by one

809
01:08:30,917 --> 01:08:34,751
See this? A machine like
this is inside that room

810
01:08:35,042 --> 01:08:36,635
The machine will register your vote

811
01:08:37,292 --> 01:08:40,262
There's a button next
to each candidate's name

812
01:08:40,417 --> 01:08:44,126
Press the button for the
person you want to vote for

813
01:08:44,542 --> 01:08:45,338
OK?

814
01:08:46,792 --> 01:08:48,009
Please translate

815
01:09:01,125 --> 01:09:02,968
- How much money do we get?
- Shut up!

816
01:09:03,417 --> 01:09:06,136
Voting is your birthright

817
01:09:07,417 --> 01:09:11,718
You won't be paid. Nor
will you be forced to vote

818
01:09:21,625 --> 01:09:22,626
Understand?

819
01:09:24,917 --> 01:09:26,385
Any questions?

820
01:09:27,917 --> 01:09:29,089
Don't be scared. Ask

821
01:09:32,042 --> 01:09:34,090
How does voting benefit them?

822
01:09:35,292 --> 01:09:38,842
This is the country's
biggest election

823
01:09:39,542 --> 01:09:44,503
Don't you want roads, electricity,
water and social justice?

824
01:09:45,292 --> 01:09:48,375
The man you vote for
will make all this happen

825
01:09:49,417 --> 01:09:51,761
He'll bring improvements

826
01:10:04,167 --> 01:10:07,250
"This jungle is more
dangerous than beautiful

mine could explode

being held under these circumstances

laws of this land are passed

01:10:25,917 --> 01:10:26,839
It's in Delhi

834
01:10:27,292 --> 01:10:29,386
The candidate you choose...

835
01:10:30,667 --> 01:10:33,511
We have our own laws.
Thousands of years old

836
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,844
Please cooperate and translate

837
01:10:39,042 --> 01:10:42,091
Tell them that the man they
vote for will go to Delhi

838
01:10:55,792 --> 01:10:59,717
They say he's their leader,
he can go to Delhi

839
01:11:00,292 --> 01:11:04,468
You can't go to Delhi, you
aren't standing in the elections

First time they've
heard these names

Which candidate will give them
a fair price for Tendu leaves?

859
01:12:14,250 --> 01:12:16,844
They say if they vote, the
Maoists will trouble them...

860
01:12:17,417 --> 01:12:20,626
...or the police will.
No one asks what they want

861
01:12:22,167 --> 01:12:23,589
What do they want?

862
01:12:23,875 --> 01:12:25,627
Freedom from both

Sir, should I handle it?

865
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,879
Loknath, two minutes.
Let me explain. Two minutes.

866
01:12:35,750 --> 01:12:37,718
After the elections...

867
01:12:37,917 --> 01:12:41,376
Mr Newton, this is beyond you

868
01:12:41,625 --> 01:12:42,717
Now let me take over

869
01:12:46,167 --> 01:12:47,760
Shame on you people!

870
01:12:48,667 --> 01:12:50,715
These gentlemen have
come to this jungle...

871
01:12:50,917 --> 01:12:53,136
...risking their lives for you

872
01:12:56,042 --> 01:12:57,635
What?

873
01:12:58,125 --> 01:12:58,751
Just wait

874
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,593
Must you treat them like this?

875
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:02,092
Please wait

876
01:13:02,375 --> 01:13:06,755
- The voting machine is like a toy
- What nonsense! It is not a toy

877
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,126
- What are you saying?
- Be quiet

878
01:13:08,792 --> 01:13:10,715
- These are your first elections
- So what?

879
01:13:11,250 --> 01:13:14,333
You can't get their vote,
and obstruct others who can

880
01:13:14,917 --> 01:13:18,467
You're the obstructive one.
I will report you

881
01:13:18,667 --> 01:13:20,135
Go on. Write up your report

882
01:13:20,292 --> 01:13:22,010
Krishna, take him away

883
01:13:23,792 --> 01:13:25,886
This toy is easy to play with

884
01:13:26,167 --> 01:13:27,464
It has everything

885
01:13:28,375 --> 01:13:31,959
A carrot, a ship,
a motorcycle, an animal, a flower

886
01:13:32,167 --> 01:13:33,510

Press the button of
the picture you like

888

We're not children

889
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,094
He's right. You can't
talk to them like that

890
01:13:41,292 --> 01:13:42,760
- Go away!
- Why?

891
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:44,840
I am the presiding officer.
I'm in control

892
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,253
I've heard that all day

893
01:13:48,792 --> 01:13:51,011
Control, what control?

894
01:13:59,042 --> 01:14:05,004
He says, "I'm the Headman and village
judge. I'll settle your dispute"

895
01:14:05,417 --> 01:14:06,339
You'll settle it?

896
01:14:16,792 --> 01:14:18,089
Please wait

897
01:14:30,917 --> 01:14:32,885
Start the procedure

898
01:14:33,292 --> 01:14:36,375
They're coming.
We're running out of time

899
01:14:44,167 --> 01:14:47,967
<i>A faraway destination</i>

900
01:14:50,292 --> 01:14:53,876
<i>A slow pace</i>

901
01:14:56,292 --> 01:14:59,876
<i>Flying dust</i>

902
01:15:02,292 --> 01:15:05,967
<i>Reddened eyes</i>

903
01:15:08,250 --> 01:15:12,505
<i>A long straight road</i>

904
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:17,004
<i>Decided to turn its course</i>

905
01:15:19,542 --> 01:15:24,002
<i>Having seen you</i>

906
01:15:25,542 --> 01:15:29,718
<i>The bird has flown away</i>

907
01:16:04,167 --> 01:16:05,760
Ask your questions, one by one

908
01:16:10,542 --> 01:16:15,002
Some people say the atmosphere of
fear benefits the mining companies

909
01:16:15,375 --> 01:16:17,469
People will be displaced.
The companies will take over

910
01:16:17,667 --> 01:16:20,386
That's what Maoist sympathizers say

911
01:16:20,792 --> 01:16:22,260
They are the root problem

912
01:16:22,542 --> 01:16:24,385
Did the administration
burn these villages?

913
01:16:25,125 --> 01:16:26,627
Were you scared coming here?

914
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,377
Sir, the Maoists...

915
01:16:33,625 --> 01:16:35,627
...you talk about are
forced to surrender...

916
01:16:35,917 --> 01:16:38,511
...and forced to fight other
Maoists. What's the logic?

917
01:16:38,917 --> 01:16:41,511
Durjan. Tukaram. Come here!

918
01:16:42,292 --> 01:16:44,511
Tell them
- were these weapons forced on you?

919
01:16:44,750 --> 01:16:45,376
No, sir

920
01:16:45,542 --> 01:16:47,385
Did you put any pressure
on the villagers?

921
01:17:28,125 --> 01:17:31,959
What do you hope for? How will
the elections change your life?

922
01:17:32,292 --> 01:17:34,010
There'll be no change

923
01:17:34,292 --> 01:17:37,011
- You don't think so?
- No, no change

924
01:17:37,542 --> 01:17:38,634
Why not?

925
01:17:44,292 --> 01:17:47,626
<i>Somewhat united</i>

926
01:17:49,792 --> 01:17:53,751
<i>Mostly divided</i>

927
01:17:56,292 --> 01:18:00,092
<i>Bursting with air</i>

928
01:18:01,792 --> 01:18:05,751
<i>The balloon burst</i>

929
01:18:08,292 --> 01:18:13,002
<i>A new page stitched
itself into the story</i>

930
01:18:19,542 --> 01:18:24,002
<i>Having seen you</i>

931
01:18:25,542 --> 01:18:29,968
<i>The bird has flown away</i>

932
01:18:32,292 --> 01:18:35,876
<i>Who heard what?</i>

933
01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:41,630
<i>Who said what?</i>

934
01:18:43,542 --> 01:18:47,217
<i>It was a half-done night</i>

935
01:18:49,417 --> 01:18:50,259
The final count?

936
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:53,718
39 out of 76

937
01:18:55,125 --> 01:18:58,208
We need to visit other
booths. How long will you stay?

938
01:18:59,625 --> 01:19:00,751
Till 3 pm

939
01:19:01,875 --> 01:19:03,627
Why? Who's coming?

940
01:19:04,917 --> 01:19:07,511
Some voters said
they'd come after lunch

941
01:19:09,375 --> 01:19:11,252
It wouldn't be right
if we left early

942
01:19:11,792 --> 01:19:13,135
What if a voter shows up?

943
01:19:14,125 --> 01:19:15,377
There's still time

944
01:19:19,542 --> 01:19:20,714
You've no idea what's going on here

945
01:19:20,917 --> 01:19:23,136
What do you mean? Violence?

946
01:19:23,792 --> 01:19:26,386
- Booth capturing? Phony votes?
- No

947
01:20:03,667 --> 01:20:05,385
Elections have their charm

948
01:20:07,792 --> 01:20:09,385
I'm glad this is my last

949
01:20:11,792 --> 01:20:12,884
This was no election

950
01:20:14,667 --> 01:20:17,716
Voting for anyone.
Is that an election?

951
01:20:19,792 --> 01:20:21,385
So? You should've stopped it

952
01:20:21,917 --> 01:20:23,385
You saw. The procedure was followed

953
01:20:24,042 --> 01:20:27,626
You've been preaching all day.
Trying to teach people civics

954
01:20:29,625 --> 01:20:30,842
Malko, let's eat

955
01:20:31,167 --> 01:20:32,259
Mr Loknath

956
01:20:34,542 --> 01:20:35,885
I'm g0ifl9

957
01:20:36,250 --> 01:20:39,003
Never seen a specimen like
you in 3O years of duty. Come

958
01:20:47,167 --> 01:20:49,465
Mr Newton, you're
educated and knowledgeable

959
01:20:50,292 --> 01:20:51,839
Don't mind if I say something

960
01:20:54,125 --> 01:20:56,503
What you saw today
has been our life

961
01:21:07,167 --> 01:21:11,877
Great change does not come in a day.
Even the jungle took years to grow

962
01:21:23,875 --> 01:21:25,127
You want to add something?

963
01:21:38,917 --> 01:21:43,093
I have a solution to
stop the injustice here

964
01:21:43,375 --> 01:21:44,376
- What's that?
- TV

965
01:21:44,542 --> 01:21:46,840
- TV?
- TV for everyone

966
01:21:47,417 --> 01:21:49,385
Greed means nothing to them

967
01:21:49,875 --> 01:21:51,468
Greed is an alien concept

968
01:21:51,667 --> 01:21:52,759
They need TVs

969
01:21:53,167 --> 01:21:56,717
When they see Coca Cola
and washing machine ads...

970
01:21:57,042 --> 01:22:00,501
...they'll forget about the
revolution and fall in line

971
01:22:01,792 --> 01:22:03,339
Wow! You're quite the intellectual

972
01:22:03,542 --> 01:22:07,092
Can anyone stop
the sun from rising?

973
01:22:09,667 --> 01:22:11,385
Red salad!

974
01:22:13,875 --> 01:22:16,094
Food for everyone

975
01:22:16,917 --> 01:22:19,136
- What is it?
- A local recipe

976
01:22:20,292 --> 01:22:22,386
Won't madam eat with us?

977
01:22:23,125 --> 01:22:24,627
She's sulking

978
01:22:26,542 --> 01:22:29,136
Ask these boys to vote

979
01:22:30,125 --> 01:22:32,878
They're not even 16

980
01:22:34,292 --> 01:22:36,135
The first time I voted I was 14

981
01:22:36,542 --> 01:22:38,636
Back home, teenagers
pass off as candidates

982
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,719
- Where's home?
- Never mind

983
01:22:43,167 --> 01:22:44,510
How is the chicken?

984
01:22:45,542 --> 01:22:46,964
It's from a kilometer away

985
01:22:48,792 --> 01:22:49,509
Lakhma!

986
01:23:36,542 --> 01:23:38,886
As per the rules, I can't come in

987
01:23:40,167 --> 01:23:41,635
Feel bad seeing you like this

988
01:23:44,042 --> 01:23:47,876
The situation was beyond our
control. We both had a job to do

989
01:23:48,917 --> 01:23:51,636
I'd feel guilty if you didn't eat

990
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:00,592
What was that?

991
01:24:01,542 --> 01:24:02,759
Don't move. Stay put!

992
01:24:08,417 --> 01:24:09,464
- What happened?
- Hurry!

993
01:24:12,667 --> 01:24:13,634
Stay down

994
01:24:14,125 --> 01:24:14,876
Sir, it's an ambush

995
01:24:16,417 --> 01:24:18,010
Take your stuff and go

996
01:24:19,917 --> 01:24:20,839
Hurry UP!

997
01:24:24,792 --> 01:24:25,839
Take them to the highway

998
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,503
Mr Newton, take the
machine. They're attacking us

999
01:24:34,292 --> 01:24:35,134
Come out, hurry

1000
01:24:39,917 --> 01:24:42,466
Krishna's men will
take you to the highway

1001
01:24:43,292 --> 01:24:44,134
Thank you

1002
01:24:45,750 --> 01:24:46,876
Krishna, go!

1003
01:25:42,167 --> 01:25:44,261
This path will lead you home

1004
01:25:44,625 --> 01:25:46,093
- Will you manage?
- Yes

1005
01:25:46,375 --> 01:25:48,127
How will she go?
We'll take her home

1006
01:25:48,375 --> 01:25:49,627
No, sir, I can manage

1007
01:25:49,917 --> 01:25:51,385
We can take you back

1008
01:25:51,917 --> 01:25:54,887
She'll be fine. I can
send someone with her

1009
01:25:55,042 --> 01:25:56,510
There's no need

1010
01:25:56,875 --> 01:25:57,876
There's no need. I'll go

1011
01:25:58,667 --> 01:25:59,634
- Sure
- Yes

1012
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:04,377
Here's the register

1013
01:26:06,542 --> 01:26:08,465
Malko ma'am, keep this pen

1014
01:26:09,250 --> 01:26:10,627
How will you turn your
pupils into tigers?

1015
01:26:11,542 --> 01:26:14,625
See? Sir's third card
of fortune. A five

1016
01:26:15,292 --> 01:26:16,134
It's useless

1017
01:26:16,417 --> 01:26:19,341
A king, queen or ace is good

1018
01:26:20,167 --> 01:26:23,137
No, Mr Loknath. This is a five

1019
01:26:27,542 --> 01:26:29,010
And this is six

1020
01:26:31,875 --> 01:26:33,218
She means the sixth sense

1021
01:26:33,667 --> 01:26:35,010
She's explaining it to you

1022
01:26:35,292 --> 01:26:36,839
That's if he can understand

1023
01:26:39,667 --> 01:26:40,384
Ok, sir

1024
01:27:20,667 --> 01:27:23,341
Mr Loknath, you're a writer, right?

1025
01:27:24,917 --> 01:27:27,386
What do you think of
the story we were told?

1026
01:27:27,792 --> 01:27:29,715
Story? What story?

1027
01:27:31,292 --> 01:27:35,342
At first they said it was
unsafe. We shouldn't come

1028
01:27:37,417 --> 01:27:39,010
When we got here,
it seemed safe to me

1029
01:27:39,542 --> 01:27:41,385
No one came to vote at first

1030
01:27:42,125 --> 01:27:45,254
As soon as the media
showed up, so did the voters

1031
01:27:49,375 --> 01:27:51,002
They said leave after tea

1032
01:27:51,292 --> 01:27:52,760
Then it was
- leave after lunch

1033
01:27:54,417 --> 01:27:57,387
An ambush takes place
as soon as lunch is over

1034
01:27:59,667 --> 01:28:01,010
Intriguing story, no?

1035
01:28:02,417 --> 01:28:04,761
I should write it up

1036
01:28:07,542 --> 01:28:08,338
Krishna

1037
01:28:09,292 --> 01:28:12,136
- A good story?
- Meaning, sir? I don't get it

1038
01:28:14,417 --> 01:28:15,384
Let's keep walking

1039
01:28:15,875 --> 01:28:18,128
There was a dangerous ambush

1040
01:28:18,542 --> 01:28:20,510
But no message to say all is well

1041
01:28:22,417 --> 01:28:23,760
Sir, I'll just check

1042
01:28:26,667 --> 01:28:28,260
<i>Where did all the curry go?</i>

1043
01:28:29,667 --> 01:28:30,964
Come along, sir

1044
01:28:33,917 --> 01:28:34,839
Sir, please come

1045
01:28:43,917 --> 01:28:45,214
Stop, sir

1046
01:28:56,417 --> 01:28:57,760
Where are you going, sir?

1047
01:29:02,500 --> 01:29:04,628
Sir, why are you
screwing up your job?

1048
01:29:08,125 --> 01:29:09,377
Sir, let's talk

1049
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:16,085
Don't make me run. If I
have to run, I'll thrash you

1050
01:29:18,542 --> 01:29:20,510
Don't make me run!

1051
01:29:27,417 --> 01:29:28,760
What is this nonsense?

1052
01:30:53,125 --> 01:30:54,001
Where to?

1053
01:30:55,292 --> 01:30:56,214
The booth

1054
01:30:56,625 --> 01:30:57,842
At it again?

1055
01:31:45,417 --> 01:31:47,010
You're a fraud

1056
01:32:33,875 --> 01:32:35,001
They're back

1057
01:32:43,667 --> 01:32:46,090
I've caught the ghost. Let's go

1058
01:33:23,625 --> 01:33:24,376
What are you doing?

1059
01:33:24,750 --> 01:33:26,878
I'm here to vote

1060
01:33:28,042 --> 01:33:30,761
No. There is no voting here

1061
01:33:31,500 --> 01:33:34,504
- No
- There are only four of them

1062
01:33:36,417 --> 01:33:37,509
Get rid of them

1063
01:33:39,875 --> 01:33:41,343
Please wait

1064
01:33:41,625 --> 01:33:42,751
Stop!

1065
01:33:53,917 --> 01:33:55,009
Put that gun down!

1066
01:33:57,417 --> 01:33:59,465
Have you gone mad?

1067
01:33:59,917 --> 01:34:00,964
Put it down!

1068
01:34:01,292 --> 01:34:03,010
It might go off by accident

1069
01:34:04,917 --> 01:34:05,839
Put your guns down!

1070
01:34:06,667 --> 01:34:07,884
Down, I said

1071
01:34:08,667 --> 01:34:11,090
Down!

1072
01:34:17,917 --> 01:34:20,841
Wait. Nothing will happen
to you. Cast your vote

1073
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:23,252
Mr Loknath, set up the booth

1074
01:34:24,167 --> 01:34:25,589
Everyone, get back

1075
01:34:27,792 --> 01:34:30,261
Set up the machine. Get their votes

1076
01:34:30,792 --> 01:34:32,214
Go on. Get it done

1077
01:34:34,875 --> 01:34:38,084
You want them to vote. So go

1078
01:34:39,292 --> 01:34:41,966
Put the machine here

1079
01:34:43,042 --> 01:34:45,511
- Know how to sign?
- Yes

1080
01:34:46,917 --> 01:34:47,964
- Your name?
- Trilok

1081
01:34:48,792 --> 01:34:50,339
Check their voting cards

1082
01:34:53,500 --> 01:34:55,502
Put the gun down.
You'll lose your job

1083
01:34:57,750 --> 01:35:00,344
Let's talk it over.
We're on the same side

1084
01:35:00,542 --> 01:35:01,509
- Put it down
- Shut up!

1085
01:35:01,917 --> 01:35:04,261
Election officers don't
look good with guns

1086
01:35:04,417 --> 01:35:05,760
Get back

1087
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:08,126
Back!

1088
01:35:12,417 --> 01:35:14,135
<i>OK</i>

1089
01:35:15,417 --> 01:35:17,260
- Start the process
- Yes

1090
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:21,752
Sign here

1091
01:35:24,625 --> 01:35:26,093
- What's your name?
- Chandani

1092
01:35:26,292 --> 01:35:27,760
- Know who you're voting for?
- Yes

1093
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:29,377
Don't need to tell me

1094
01:35:33,417 --> 01:35:34,964
Why did you fake an ambush?

1095
01:35:36,375 --> 01:35:38,469
- Why?
- Did I have a choice?

1096
01:35:39,417 --> 01:35:42,011
I've been telling you all day
- this area is unsafe

1097
01:35:43,917 --> 01:35:46,966
We've asked for night
vision goggles for <i>2</i> years

1098
01:35:47,667 --> 01:35:49,260
Brave men are dying

1099
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:51,377
Can't take a risk for
your election picnic

1100
01:35:51,542 --> 01:35:52,464
It's not a picnic

1101
01:35:55,042 --> 01:35:56,259
It's my duty

1102
01:36:08,417 --> 01:36:09,339
Mr Loknath

1103
01:36:10,167 --> 01:36:11,259
- Done?
- Yes

1104
01:36:11,625 --> 01:36:13,377
You can leave now

1105
01:36:14,167 --> 01:36:15,635
Let's take the stuff

1106
01:36:26,167 --> 01:36:27,384
Step back!

1107
01:36:32,542 --> 01:36:33,634
Sign here

1108
01:36:36,292 --> 01:36:37,714
Two minutes to go

1109
01:36:39,292 --> 01:36:40,509
Two minutes to 3. Wait

1110
01:36:45,917 --> 01:36:49,717
Take your time. Let's wait

1111
01:36:51,917 --> 01:36:53,760
Have they left?

1112
01:36:55,667 --> 01:36:56,759
Did they cast their vote?

1113
01:37:39,667 --> 01:37:40,759
A pen

1114
01:37:44,625 --> 01:37:47,504
Take your time. We won't budge

1115
01:37:49,792 --> 01:37:52,215
- Stay still
- There's no hurry

1116
01:37:54,917 --> 01:37:56,385
Take your time

1117
01:38:05,292 --> 01:38:06,259
OK?

1118
01:38:07,792 --> 01:38:08,588
Done?

1119
01:38:18,292 --> 01:38:19,885
Ok. Shall I take the gun?

1120
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:14,627
Your total is 3450 rupees

1121
01:39:15,417 --> 01:39:18,011
Wait. Let's do something

1122
01:39:18,292 --> 01:39:20,511
We'll buy the olive oil next month

1123
01:39:20,875 --> 01:39:23,958
No, no. Take it now

1124
01:39:35,042 --> 01:39:37,136
Where is Newton Kumar?

1125
01:39:37,500 --> 01:39:38,752
That way

1126
01:39:52,250 --> 01:39:53,126
Newton sir!

1127
01:39:54,417 --> 01:39:58,126
- What happened to your neck?
- Malko! Please come

1128
01:40:00,125 --> 01:40:01,877
What brings you here?

1129
01:40:02,625 --> 01:40:06,209
I had some work.
I heard you worked here too

1130
01:40:07,250 --> 01:40:08,251
What happened to your neck?

1131
01:40:09,167 --> 01:40:12,216
A reaction to my action

1132
01:40:12,875 --> 01:40:15,469
It's much better now.
I wear this for safety

1133
01:40:17,417 --> 01:40:19,260
- And how are you?
- Fine

1134
01:40:19,500 --> 01:40:20,752
How is your school?

1135
01:40:21,042 --> 01:40:22,635
The school is fine too

1136
01:40:23,792 --> 01:40:25,260
What about you?

1137
01:40:26,042 --> 01:40:27,840
You can see

1138
01:40:32,375 --> 01:40:33,752
I got an award for punctuality

1139
01:40:36,875 --> 01:40:37,876
WOW!

1140
01:40:38,292 --> 01:40:40,010
The department awarded you?

1141
01:40:40,292 --> 01:40:42,340
You see I'm always on time

1142
01:40:42,750 --> 01:40:44,377
The office starts at nine,
and I'm here on the dot

1143
01:40:44,625 --> 01:40:46,002
People think it's a big deal

1144
01:40:46,417 --> 01:40:47,760
Hence the award

1145
01:40:48,375 --> 01:40:51,584
Sir, an honest officer
should be awarded

1146
01:40:52,167 --> 01:40:55,376
Don't know about honesty.
I'm just doing my duty

1147
01:40:56,417 --> 01:40:59,626
An award for honesty involves
the greatest dishonesty

1148
01:41:01,917 --> 01:41:05,000
- The election has changed you a lot
- No

1149
01:41:05,375 --> 01:41:07,377
I haven't changed one bit.
I'm just the same

1150
01:41:09,417 --> 01:41:11,260
Was everything ok after I left?

1151
01:41:12,042 --> 01:41:15,626
A long story. I'll tell
you over tea some day

1152
01:41:15,792 --> 01:41:17,009
Let's have tea now

1153
01:41:20,500 --> 01:41:22,753
Five minutes before the
next break. Can you wait?

1154
01:41:23,042 --> 01:41:23,759
Yes

1155
01:41:24,042 --> 01:41:25,840
Let me finish this

1156
01:41:36,417 --> 01:41:37,509
I am glad you came.
