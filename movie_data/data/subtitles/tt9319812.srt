1
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,280
'Sometimes one message is enough'

2
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,240
'to change your life.'

3
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,680
'I am Namit Gupta.'

4
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,120
'Everyone in Noida'

5
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,920
'knew me only as
the son of Parasnath Gupta,

6
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,760
'the owner
of Kaushalya Devi Trust Hospital,'

7
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,240
'who couldn't become a doctor.'

8
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,280
'Whenever I tried to forget
my failures,'

9
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,960
'dad would come and remind me.'

10
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,160
Namit!

11
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,400
Why did you tell the couple who were
our patients not to go for endoscopy?

12
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,840
The man was suffering from indigestion

13
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,760
as he ate a lot at a wedding
the previous day.

14
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,360
So, you have started treating patients.

15
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,840
I am not treating anyone.

16
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,360
But when a pill that costs six rupees
can do the job,

17
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,320
why waste 6000 on endoscopy?

18
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,240
This is my hospital.

19
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,400
I am the doctor here.

20
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,840
If you were interested in
practising medicine,

21
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,840
you should have thought
about it four years ago.

22
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,520
You are a manager.

23
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,440
Do your job and go home.

24
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,520
'It's been four years since
that happened.'

25
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,680
'But there is still
an eerie silence in my life,'

26
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,160
'which would end with
the noisy memories of those three.'

27
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,480
'There are two things that
you need for the perfect selfie.'

28
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,840
'The correct angle.'

29
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,240
'And the right filter.'

30
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,520
'To give my career the right direction'

31
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,240
'and to manage my family business,'

32
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,960
'dad sent me to National Medical
Institute and Hospital in Noida.'

33
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,640
'I put my dreams on hold
and managed to'

34
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,600
'clear my first year somehow.'

35
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,480
'Friends and studies kept me
so occupied in the first year'

36
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,640
'that I didn't realise
when it was over.'

37
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,920
'I'd spend more time at the theatre
and cafÃ© than in labs and classes.'

38
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,400
'If I wouldn't be there'

39
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,720
'I'd be found in room number 17.'

40
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,680
'Technically, it wasn't my room.'

41
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,080
'But the occupants of this room
were Abeer Khan'

42
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,720
'and Surjo Pandey.'

43
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,160
'He is Abeer Khan.'

44
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,440
'He is the most decent guy
from Kalyanpur, Kanpur.'

45
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,600
'His dad's love story is popular
in the entire neighbourhood.'

46
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,520
'But unfortunately, he doesn't
have his dad's qualities.'

47
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,120
'He is considered so decent'

48
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,160
'that not only the girls
in the neighbourhood,'

49
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,760
'but even others are scared
to be friends with him on Facebook.'

50
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,720
'He is Surjo Kumar Pandey.'

51
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,640
'Pradhan Pandey nurtured him
and his village.'

52
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,880
'People say that Surjo Kumar was
the first doctor in India.'

53
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,200
'Mr Pandey also wanted'

54
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,400
'his Surjo Kumar to be
the first doctor from his village.'

55
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,120
'Check out how hard Surjo worked towards
fulfilling Mr Pandey's dream.'

56
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,560
'First, we drink and then we enjoy.'

57
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,120
Surjo's first valentine.

58
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,240
Happy Valentine's day.

59
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,720
Surjo Kumar Pandey wore
Abeer Khan's shirt once again.

60
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,440
Here's a live telecast of the incident
from room number 17.

61
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,720
Why do you always wear my shirt?

62
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,160
I like it.
- What do you mean?

63
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,680
It will start stinking now.

64
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,160
I want my shirt.
- Do you want to have tea?

65
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,160
Yes.
- Do you want to have tea?

66
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,160
Yes.
- Apologise.

67
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,240
Why should I apologise?

68
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,600
Then you won't get tea.
- Namit.

69
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,680
Stop recording and
tell him to give me my shirt.

70
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,880
I won't give you tea.
- For the 125th time

71
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,120
Abeer and Surjo are arguing
while having lunch.

72
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,360
Because Surjo ate Abeer's dessert.

73
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,680
I don't want to have lunch.
- What's wrong?

74
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,200
I don't like your behaviour.
I won't have lunch now.

75
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,480
What happened? - Why do you
always eat my 'gulab jamun'?

76
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,560
Eat yours!

77
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,280
Why do you have a problem
when they don't?

78
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,200
It may be okay for them,
but it isn't for me.

79
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,320
What's wrong?

80
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,040
Every medical student
has to face this day.

81
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,160
Today, it's our turn.

82
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,920
Hey!

83
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,360
He fell unconscious.

84
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,960
My room was next to room number 17.

85
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,720
I only kept my clothes and my bag here.

86
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,040
Because I'd always be
in Abeer and Surjo's room.

87
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,160
Besides, my room was filled with
something other than books.

88
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,040
The entire credit for it goes to

89
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,560
my liquor loving friend Vikram.

90
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,280
When did you arrive? How are you?

91
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,320
I just got here.

92
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,680
Vikram, what is this?

93
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,720
What?

94
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,440
The bottles?

95
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,200
I stocked up for the entire year.

96
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,600
Why bother buying one at a time?

97
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,560
Listen, don't worry.

98
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,680
I am quite strong.
Nothing will harm me.

99
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,080
You need to drink good quality liquor.

100
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,320
We would enjoy it too.

101
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,520
For you, my kiss is enough.

102
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,200
Don't do that early in the morning.
- Just one...

103
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,600
Come on.
- Your mouth stinks.

104
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,720
What are you talking about?
I just brushed my teeth.

105
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,640
Namit...
- I don't want your kiss...

106
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,240
Are you blind?
- Get lost!

107
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,120
So,

108
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,720
what's the plan?

109
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,320
It's an amazing plan.

110
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,920
Unlimited calls

111
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,680
with 1 GB data everyday for Rs 299.

112
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,360
Do you want the Rs 299 plan?

113
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,520
You'll always be a passenger train.

114
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,760
Why?

115
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,360
We are talking about our plans
for Freshers party.

116
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,400
We don't want to know about
your data plan.

117
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,480
Idiot.

118
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,040
We'll throw a party for the freshers.

119
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,480
Just let me get my phone fixed.

120
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,680
What if a fresher asks for my number?

121
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,360
Of course. They have no choice.

122
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,320
Why don't you start living with them?

123
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,320
You don't miss us.

124
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,640
When he went to his village,
I called him 200 times in 2 months.

125
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,400
But I couldn't get through once.

126
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,920
There's no network in my village.

127
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,080
The 'kal' won't go through.
Explain that to him.

128
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,400
He is right.

129
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,520
What do you mean?
- How would the 'kal' go through?

130
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,520
Abeer,

131
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,960
it's the 'call' that goes through.

132
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,560
Don't try to teach me English.

133
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,320
I scored 75 percent in English.

134
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,400
You think you are 'Sexpier'!
- Oh, yeah. Cool.

135
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,360
Pronounce it right. It's 'Shakespeare'.

136
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,280
That's what I said. 'Sexpier'.

137
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,040
That's what he is saying, 'Sexpier'

138
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,480
Yes, 'Sexpier'!

139
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,600
It's 'Shakespeare'.

140
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,920
That's what I said, 'Sexpier'.

141
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,640
'Sexpier'

142
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,040
Shut up!

143
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,040
Damn you!
- Surjo, you are unique.

144
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,680
Anyway, forget it.

145
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:38,000
Let's get ready to welcome the freshers.

146
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,360
'Manjari.'

147
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,600
'The central character in this story'

148
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,200
'as well as my story.'

149
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:57,520
'A perfect blend of simplicity,
beauty and honesty.'

150
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,200
'She decided in her childhood'

151
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,120
'that she would carry a stethoscope
and not a rolling pin.'

152
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,720
'She had great determination
and big dreams.'

153
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,480
'She was the youngest in her family.'

154
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,960
If you give everyone medicine

155
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,760
instead of looking after him
in his old age,

156
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,280
you won't earn blessings. Got it?

157
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,720
Dad, why are you quiet?

158
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,920
Manjari, why do you want to be a doctor?

159
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,320
You will get married.

160
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,280
You will have to cook and clean.

161
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,480
I think she has got attitude.

162
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,560
Get her married.

163
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,280
She will know her place in the world.

164
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,240
Aunt, I am sorry

165
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,800
but no one can get me
married for the next five years.

166
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,640
Look,

167
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,120
she will do whatever she wants.

168
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,200
So, what's point of arguing with her?

169
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,440
Let's go.

170
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,720
They are not going to listen to us.

171
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,200
Come on.

172
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,920
Let's go!

173
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,240
Don't just sit there.

174
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,760
Aunt!

175
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,200
The last time you were here you took
some 'halwa' in a container.

176
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,640
You haven't returned the container.

177
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,080
Bring it with you next time.

178
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,840
Hello!

179
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,520
Wow!

180
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,160
That's an awesome shirt you are wearing.

181
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,400
He wants to impress
the freshers, Anokhe.

182
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,320
Thanks.

183
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,560
First impression is the last impression.

184
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,000
Let me tell you something.
I have a similar shirt.

185
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:33,960
Really?

186
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,920
Yes. Where did you buy it from?

187
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,760
I bought it from Kanpur.

188
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,400
Where in Kanpur?

189
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,240
In Kanpur!

190
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,520
N-320 Avash Vikash, Kalyanpur.

191
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,600
That's my address.

192
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,720
The shirt is also yours.

193
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,880
Surjo, I hate this about you.

194
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,200
I have told you many times
not to wear my clothes.

195
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,320
But you believe they are yours.

196
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,120
Hey, you! Where are you going?

197
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,480
Hey, stop.

198
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,520
Hey!

199
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,480
'We want a kiss!'

200
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,920
'We want a kiss!'

201
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,240
'We want a kiss!'

202
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,440
'We want a kiss!'

203
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,040
'We want a kiss!'

204
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,360
'We want a kiss!'

205
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,800
'We want a kiss!'

206
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,520
'We want a kiss!'

207
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,640
Hey!

208
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,440
What's your name?

209
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,840
Manjari Mishra.

210
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,760
Manjari Mishra!

211
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,680
'Mr Mishra!'

212
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,280
'Mr Mishra!'

213
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,920
'Mr Mishra!'

214
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,720
'Mr Mishra!'

215
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,680
'Mr Mishra!'

216
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,800
'She is Mr Mishra's wife.'

217
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,880
She seems shocked.

218
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,160
First day?

219
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,800
Yes.

220
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,720
Say, 'Yes, sir.'

221
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,520
Are you a professor?

222
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,400
Don't try to be smart with me.

223
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,080
Look, I know this is
ragging and it's wrong.

224
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,920
So?
- 'Oh! She knows everything.'

225
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,120
What will you do?

226
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,400
Will you complain about it?

227
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,920
Who will you complain to?

228
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,280
I just want my bag.

229
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,680
You are here to
become a doctor, aren't you?

230
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,560
Then, pass this test

231
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,800
and take your bag.

232
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,480
Simple.

233
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,320
Look at him.

234
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,200
Assume that he has stopped breathing.

235
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,680
He almost drowned.

236
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:50,760
Now, the only way you can save him is
through mouth to mouth resuscitation.

237
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,200
I hope you know

238
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,960
what's mouth to mouth resuscitation.

239
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,400
Mouth to mouth resuscitation
is a technique

240
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,480
used to resuscitate a person.

241
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,240
First up...

242
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,240
Enough of theory.

243
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,920
Let's test your practical knowledge.

244
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,560
'We want a kiss!'

245
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,480
'We want a kiss!'

246
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,160
'We want a kiss.
- Arman.'

247
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,560
'We want kiss.
- We want kiss.'

248
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,080
We'll explain
mouth to mouth resuscitation.

249
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,400
Hey, you. Get up!

250
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,200
We will give you mouth to mouth. Move!

251
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,560
Mouth to mouth!

252
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,840
Do the three of you need to
meddle in everything?

253
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,600
Don't get angry.

254
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,480
Why are you asking a girl?

255
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,240
You learned this treatment over here
last year. Don't you remember?

256
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,920
Yes. He was practising mouth to mouth

257
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
and it's on your phone.
- What?

258
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,240
Show me the video.
- Shall I?

259
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,600
Yes, go ahead.
- Okay.

260
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,160
If it's embarrassing
in front of the girl,

261
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,240
let her go.

262
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,520
Surjo, show me the video.

263
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,600
Come on.

264
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,760
Get going.
Otherwise, I'll ruin your hairstyle.

265
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,960
Guys, the show is over.

266
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,040
Go and practice mouth to mouth.

267
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,200
Bye.

268
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,080
Acting smart.
- Bye.

269
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,360
What!

270
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,960
She didn't even thank us.

271
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,080
These are the dark ages indeed.

272
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,160
Let's go to class.

273
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,640
Forget it.

274
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,480
'If Manjari had shook
my hand that day, '

275
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,680
'that would probably have been
the end of the matter.'

276
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,960
'Her thankless style touched me.'

277
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,400
'She was weird, but I liked her.'

278
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,080
'After that day, whenever I saw her,'

279
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,800
'she struck a chord
in my heart and mind.'

280
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,720
'My heart had given me the go ahead,'

281
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,160
'but my mind failed to understand'

282
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,800
'why I liked her so much.'

283
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,240
'One fine night I realised why.'

284
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,480
'Dengue had spread all over the city.'

285
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,520
'Due to shortage of beds,'

286
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,080
'the hospital refused to admit
more patients.'

287
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,840
'It was wrong.'

288
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,960
'But nobody did anything about it
or objected to it.'

289
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,680
'But on that day,'

290
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,560
'Manjari was going to have
a showdown with the authorities.'

291
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,360
How can you be so callous?

292
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,400
What's going on here for the last
four hours?

293
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,880
If there's no room for them
in such a huge hospital,

294
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,880
where will they go?

295
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,760
And you don't have vacant beds!
What kind of an excuse is that?

296
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,440
We accommodate more people at home
although we don't have enough room.

297
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,320
If relatives show up,

298
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,040
we borrow mattresses from our neighbours

299
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,320
to ensure their comfort.

300
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,120
We don't ask them to leave
because we don't have mattresses.

301
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,760
Open the door. They want to go inside.

302
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,480
Can't you hear me?

303
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,800
Calm down!

304
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,800
What's going on here?

305
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,640
This is a hospital.

306
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,080
Please understand.

307
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,280
We can't admit more patients
when the occupancy is full.

308
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,800
You're a fresher.

309
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,560
Behave like one.

310
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,800
Don't try to be a doctor.

311
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,600
I am sorry, sir. No one can stop me

312
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,360
from showing compassion.

313
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,800
You're a doctor. Start treating them.

314
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,400
I will arrange for the beds.

315
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:21,080
'We often fall in love with people
who raise their voice for others.'

316
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,440
'I didn't fall in love,'

317
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,360
'but I applauded her.'

318
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,640
'Is she the woman
we've read about in books'

319
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,480
'or seen in movies?'

320
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,920
'She was a determined
and self-respecting woman.'

321
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,720
'On that day, I got to know
the real Manjari.'

322
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,400
'We were left stunned.'

323
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,120
'She arranged for the mattresses.'

324
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,840
'When Surjo saw a woman taking
the matter in her own hand,'

325
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,440
'he felt the way I did.'

326
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,600
Friends, don't you think

327
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,760
we should learn something from
that woman?

328
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:28,080
'We just got a few mattresses
to the hospital from the hostel.'

329
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,680
'But it felt like we had won a war.'

330
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:35,120
'Then, Manjari made us feel special.'

331
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,440
Sometimes...

332
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,960
Thanks.
- You're welcome.

333
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,000
Your name is Abeer, right?

334
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,040
Yes.

335
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,240
You're most welcome.

336
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,480
You're name is Amit, right?

337
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,120
It's not Amit. It's Namit.

338
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,960
Yes, it's the same. Namit or Amit.

339
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,960
They are not the same.

340
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,800
What if I call you Khanjari?

341
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,640
Manjari or Khanjari.

342
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,200
It's the same, right?

343
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,720
You took offence.

344
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,840
You know, someone has said,
'What's in a name?'

345
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,840
Manjari, it's said by none
other than 'Sexpier'!

346
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,600
Really? Thanks for telling me.

347
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:38,080
Wow! You're thanking everyone today.

348
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,440
What happened the other day?

349
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,080
The other day, I felt as if you
were trying too hard to impress me.

350
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,760
I see.

351
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,200
What you did today was incredible.

352
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,480
Fantastic! Too good!

353
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,640
But that doesn't mean you have
the license to judge me.

354
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,800
I am sorry.

355
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,200
My mistake.

356
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,080
Good night.

357
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,080
Goodbye, Amit.

358
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,960
Oops! Namit.

359
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:19,360
'When she was leaving, I wanted to tell
her that she could call me anything.'

360
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,360
'I wanted her to know'

361
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,360
'that I was head over heels
in love with her.'

362
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:30,520
'For the first time in my life, I did
something that made me feel proud.'

363
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,520
'But some people thought
we were being naughty.'

364
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,480
She is a fresher.

365
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,640
But you guys should have been
more prudent.

366
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,240
We are sorry, ma'am.
- What sorry!

367
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,840
I don't think you're sorry.

368
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,600
You shouldn't have taken
the staff's mattresses.

369
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,480
Ma'am, we are really sorry.
- I know. I know everything.

370
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,120
A girl wanted something and you took it
as an opportunity to impress her.

371
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,840
Henceforth, the reporting time at
the hostel for the three of you is 6 pm.

372
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,480
Ma'am!
- Understand?

373
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,520
Manjari.

374
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,080
I am giving you a warning.

375
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,160
Sorry, ma'am.

376
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,840
But they didn't do anything wrong.

377
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,160
Either don't punish them

378
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,760
or punish me as well.

379
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,800
Ma'am, all four of them are
feeling very charitable.

380
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,600
Why don't you send them to the
health camp in the nearby village?

381
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,960
Why are you like this?

382
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,040
Like what?

383
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,480
Like...

384
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:34,160
"She is nice to everyone."

385
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,960
"But she doesn't talk to me nicely."

386
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,040
"She speaks politely with everyone."

387
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,640
"But she is rude to me."

388
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,640
"I wonder why she ignores me."

389
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:53,920
"As if we are strangers."

390
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:59,240
"Why are you so special?"

391
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:07,240
"Why are you so special?"

392
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:35,400
"We are close, yet so far."

393
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,640
"You don't speak to me
unless there's a reason."

394
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:47,400
"We are close, yet so far."

395
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:53,200
"You don't speak to me
unless there's a reason."

396
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:59,200
"Please give me a smile
even if it's fake. Please smile."

397
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:04,960
"Please talk to me. Talk to me."

398
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:11,720
"Please give me a smile."

399
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:16,040
"Why are you so special?"

400
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:22,280
"Why are you so special?"

401
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,200
"I want to make a request to you."

402
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,560
"Please bring a smile on my face."

403
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:31,920
"Listen to me."

404
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:36,520
"Why are you so special?"

405
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,760
"Why are you so special?"

406
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,320
Listen up!

407
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,720
The bus can't go any further.

408
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,200
The next bus will arrive in the morning.
Make arrangements for your stay.

409
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,120
What did the conductor say?

410
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,880
Where will we stay tonight?

411
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,800
The three of us can manage,

412
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,480
but what will Manjari do?

413
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,880
Where is she?

414
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,960
I've made arrangements for our stay
at a school nearby.

415
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,120
Want to join me?

416
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,480
Give me my money.

417
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,840
When will you give it to me?
You always say that.

418
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,960
I swear, I will give you
the money tomorrow.

419
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:56,240
"Money drives everyone crazy."

420
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,800
Thank you.

421
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,760
"Money runs the world."

422
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,160
Surjo.
- What?

423
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,080
You would know all this.

424
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,840
What?
- Cooking.

425
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,720
Of course, I'm the village cook.
I'd surely know.

426
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,240
Silly boy.

427
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,400
Tell me something. Who among us
belongs to a village?

428
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,040
You mean, only villagers can cook.

429
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,720
People living in the city
don't need food.

430
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,480
Why are you getting annoyed?

431
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,120
Look at Manjari and
learn something from her.

432
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,360
What do you want to eat? Decide quickly.

433
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,800
She's coming to ask us.

434
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,320
There's no restaurant here and no
home delivery system.

435
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,760
We have to make food by ourselves.

436
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,920
There's a shop nearby.

437
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:59,240
If you get some groceries,
I will cook for all of us.

438
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,040
Hey!

439
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,920
What are you doing?

440
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:12,760
"I will never forget it."

441
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:15,840
Well...

442
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,320
Actually, we are not hungry.

443
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,400
We had snacks in the evening, right?

444
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,880
Yes, we are not hungry. We are full.

445
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,960
And you know what?
We don't eat after six o'clock.

446
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,600
It's a sin. Right?

447
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,840
Yes.
- Are you sure?

448
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,840
You have to spend the whole night.

449
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:38,800
If you guys are scared,
I will come with you.

450
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,080
What? We are not scared of anybody.

451
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,480
And why would we be scared?

452
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,240
We don't want to eat because we
are not hungry.

453
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,720
See, I just got a burp.

454
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,200
I am famished.

455
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,960
And I am used to having
dinner in the night.

456
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,680
Excuse me! Fight over there.

457
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,000
Give me a packet of Maggi.

458
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:30,960
Are you hungry?

459
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,160
Surjo, she asked us something.

460
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,040
Yes, let's go.

461
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,840
You don't eat after six o'clock.

462
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,960
We shouldn't disrespect food.

463
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,440
There's some extra food.

464
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,720
It will be wasted.

465
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,400
We shouldn't waste food.

466
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,760
Thank you.

467
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,480
Let's have it.

468
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,800
I've had Maggi many times,

469
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,680
but it has never tasted so delicious.

470
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,760
By the way,
I wanted to tell you something.

471
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,520
When you came to ask us

472
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,280
if we wanted to eat something, we got...

473
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,400
Scared?

474
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,680
Am I right?
- Yes.

475
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,320
It's okay.

476
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,080
I was also scared.

477
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,360
But I was hungry too.

478
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,560
You're really special.

479
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,840
No, I am a normal girl.

480
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,400
'There was something different
about her.'

481
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:05,720
'Otherwise, nobody would join
the wedding procession of a stranger?'

482
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,960
'When a girl starts
hanging out with boys,'

483
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,360
'they learn to behave.'

484
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,680
Not beer. Let's have whiskey.

485
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,880
Beer!
- Whiskey!

486
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,840
Beer!
- Whiskey!

487
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:34,760
Beer!
- Whiskey!

488
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,120
I want to have a beer!
- Whiskey!

489
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,320
Who wants to have whiskey?

490
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,880
Not whiskey. I was saying
we should drink lassi in the evening.

491
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,600
Lassi!
- Yes.

492
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,280
We will have juice.
- Lassi!

493
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,200
Come on!

494
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,560
'She became a part of our gang.'

495
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:52,320
'I noticed Manjari's behaviour
change with every passing day.'

496
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,800
'But I noticed'

497
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,680
'the biggest change in me.'

498
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,240
The costumes and the props
haven't been ordered yet.

499
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,200
The show is next week.

500
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,440
We will manage. It's no big deal.

501
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,400
This isn't funny. Please hurry up.

502
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,520
Shall we start?

503
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:19,960
Yes.

504
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,720
'Can't you stay back for one more day?'

505
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,400
'No.'

506
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,400
'I will have to go.'

507
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,320
'Please stay back.'

508
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,480
'For whom?'

509
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,240
'For me.'

510
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:35,880
'But why?'

511
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,800
'Because without you,
the days seem too long.'

512
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,080
'And the nights
seem to be never-ending.'

513
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,240
'I keep looking at
the other side of the road.'

514
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,200
'Waiting for your car.'

515
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,000
'So that I can 'advertise'
my feelings for you.'

516
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,760
It's not 'advertise', it's 'express'.

517
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,120
The word is express, my dear. Express!

518
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,800
Okay.

519
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,960
Keep chatting before the rehearsals!

520
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,600
Take a break for five minutes
and rehearse the dialogues well.

521
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,920
Okay, I will try.

522
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,440
Hi.
- Hi.

523
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,160
My lecture got cancelled, so I came here

524
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,560
to see your rehearsal.

525
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:29,640
Well, my rehearsals are not going well.

526
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:31,840
Why?

527
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,760
Because the heroine
can't remember her lines.

528
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,440
Change the lines.

529
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,120
What? Change the lines!

530
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,360
The lines are pretty good.

531
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,640
It's a stupid drama.

532
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:45,880
I see.

533
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,760
Why don't you tell me the lines?

534
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,480
What do you mean?
- Tell me some new lines.

535
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,760
'Can't you stay back for one more day?'

536
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:58,840
'No.'

537
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,320
'I will have to go.'

538
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,240
'Please stay back.'

539
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,520
'For whom?'

540
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,880
'For me.'

541
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,160
'But why?'

542
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:15,840
'Because...'

543
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,560
'I love you.'

544
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,320
It's simple.

545
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,640
She will say that and it's done.

546
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:30,120
Why go on about the moon and the stars?

547
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,360
So...

548
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,120
Won't she say anything else?

549
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,400
She will.

550
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,960
What?
- I love you.

551
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:48,200
'Manjari threw a curve ball
and knocked me out.'

552
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,160
'But I had no clue'

553
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,280
'that two other guys were
also falling for her.'

554
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:10,680
"On the road, under the sun,"

555
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:14,160
"I feel like dancing with joy."

556
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,840
"It's difficult to control my emotions."

557
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:21,360
"I feel like dancing with joy."

558
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:24,960
"Love is in the air."

559
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:28,880
"Don't harbour misunderstandings."

560
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,400
"Let's have some fun."

561
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:36,040
"I am in for some fun.
Let's have some fun."

562
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:39,640
"Let's have some fun."

563
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:43,160
"I am in for some fun.
Let's have some fun."

564
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,520
Are you studying biochemistry?
- Yes.

565
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,000
Good.

566
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,720
By the way,

567
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:59,480
we have done well in chemistry,
haven't we?

568
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,800
I see.

569
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,600
You don't mean the subject.

570
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,760
You want to develop chemistry with me.

571
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,800
"I want to stay in your heart."

572
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,000
I want to meet Manjari.

573
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,440
Where are you going?

574
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:16,040
"How do you feel about me?
Please tell me."

575
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:22,560
"You are the solution
to all my problems."

576
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:26,320
"Give a new twist to our love story."

577
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:29,760
The way she fed rasgulla to me...

578
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,440
It drove me crazy.

579
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:37,200
"Let's have some fun."

580
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:40,760
"I am in for some fun.
Let's have some fun."

581
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:44,480
"Let's have some fun."

582
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,760
"I am in for some fun.
Let's have some fun."

583
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,320
"Let's have some fun."

584
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,920
Manjari...

585
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,680
Manjari!

586
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,600
Manjari, I am with you.

587
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,480
Manjari, listen to me.

588
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:24,160
Abeer, what are you saying?

589
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,320
Manjari...

590
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,640
Hey!

591
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,800
Why are you uttering
Manjari's name in your sleep?

592
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,120
What...

593
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,000
What happened?

594
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,560
Tell us, pal.

595
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:44,880
What?

596
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,320
Hey!

597
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,320
Tell us what happened, pal.

598
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,120
Guys,

599
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,160
I think I am in love.

600
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,360
With whom?

601
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:09,760
Take a guess.

602
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,840
Who is she?

603
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,640
Manjari!

604
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:20,720
That's not possible!

605
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,520
But I am in love.

606
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:25,000
You think you are in love?
- Yes.

607
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:26,960
Well then,

608
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,440
forget her.

609
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:30,800
Why should I forget her?

610
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,240
How can I forget her? I won't!

611
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,760
Hold on!
- Forget her, he says.

612
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,240
Abeer.
- What?

613
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:39,280
You are in love with Manjari, right?

614
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:42,360
But is...
- Is Manjari in love with me?

615
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,120
That's the best thing!

616
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,800
I think Manjari is also
in love with me.

617
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,240
We are in love.

618
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,400
That's not possible.

619
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,920
We are in love!
Why do you think it's not possible?

620
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,240
Keep your mouth shut!

621
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,680
Namit, you tell me.

622
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,840
How would we look as a couple?

623
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,880
Nonsense!

624
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,560
Disgusting!

625
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,040
You won't look good together.

626
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,440
What's your problem?

627
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,280
She will look great

628
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,680
only with one guy.

629
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:13,920
Right, Namit?

630
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,520
And who is that guy?

631
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,320
Me.

632
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,400
What rubbish!

633
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,280
Believe me, guys. She said it.

634
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,600
Chemistry is just an excuse.

635
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:31,360
She wants to create
a chemistry between us.

636
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,360
She said this to me in private.

637
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,160
Did Manjari really say that?
- Yes.

638
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:39,440
Did you forget to gargle today?
Are you high on something?

639
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,640
He has crossed all limits
of overconfidence!

640
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:42,880
Shut your mouth.

641
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,080
Namit.

642
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,200
You must have sensed something.

643
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,080
Does she love Abeer or me?

644
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,800
What do you think?
- Tell us, Namit.

645
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,360
We went to the polio camp together.

646
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,720
We spend time in the library.

647
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,160
No, you don't!
- Yes, we do!

648
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,520
What do you think?
- He is lying!

649
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,080
I am not lying.
- Tell me the truth.

650
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,040
Tell me what you truly feel.
- I think...

651
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,400
What do you think?
- What is it?

652
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,520
Tell us, Namit.

653
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,080
I think Manjari loves me.

654
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,040
I didn't realise when this happened.

655
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,000
You guys didn't tell me anything.

656
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,080
Namit,

657
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,240
what makes you so sure?

658
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,160
It's simple.

659
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,240
She is our friend.

660
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,640
But who did she
express her feelings to?

661
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:36,360
What? Did she say 'I love you'?

662
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,480
What rubbish! You are a liar!

663
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,600
He says that she expressed
her feelings to him.

664
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,000
Surjo, I am not lying.

665
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:44,280
I am madly in love with Manjari.

666
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,840
It has become complicated now.

667
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,280
I never thought

668
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:53,560
a girl would cause a rift between us.

669
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,760
Damn!
- Why would there be conflict between us?

670
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,760
Why would she create a rift between us?

671
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,640
Love is a terrible thing!

672
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,720
Why should we fight amongst ourselves?

673
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,120
Why should we fight? Answer me!

674
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,160
Look, guys.

675
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:11,320
Manjari will have to find
a nice guy sooner or later.

676
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,600
We are her friends.

677
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,200
Don't you think we should help her?

678
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:18,800
Hmm.

679
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,320
The two of you should tell her

680
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,280
to start thinking about me.

681
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,320
Such a lot of confidence.

682
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,840
What for, Surjo?

683
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,280
She will not think about you
even in her dreams.

684
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,200
Guys, it's not that confusing.

685
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:40,200
In the normal world, any girl
would choose me over you two.

686
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,840
Why? Are you precious?

687
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,320
What's so special about you?

688
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,560
Why are we arguing?
Let's go and ask Manjari.

689
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:54,080
She will choose one of us
and the other two will step back.

690
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,880
Really? And who will ask her?

691
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:59,040
You ask her. You get to hear
her say 'I love you'.

692
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:01,640
Surjo.

693
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,160
Surjo will ask her.

694
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,560
You want me to ask her!

695
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,440
Tell me when and how.

696
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,280
Manjari's birthday is in two weeks.

697
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,520
That's when we will ask her.

698
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:16,880
Wow, pal.

699
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:20,440
You have done a lot of research
about your sister-in-law.

700
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,080
Thanks for telling me.

701
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,200
Sharing is caring. Good boy!

702
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,640
Had my family not pressurised me
to become a doctor,

703
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,240
I would have become a detective.

704
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:30,960
A detective doesn't do that.

705
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,920
Someone with a defective mind does it.
You thief!

706
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,240
You think you are a detective.

707
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,360
Are you done?

708
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,600
Listen to me carefully.

709
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:43,600
After cutting the cake,
the one she feeds

710
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,280
the piece of the cake first

711
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,760
is the one she loves the most.

712
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,200
The other two will back out.

713
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,240
Do you agree?

714
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:58,320
The one she feeds the cake first.

715
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:01,760
I agree.

716
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,160
'Every lover boy celebrates
the greatest festival once a year.'

717
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,160
'The girl's birthday.'

718
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,720
'We were making arrangements
for that special day.'

719
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,880
'Our wish was going to
be fulfilled on that day.'

720
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,280
'She was bombarded with messages.'

721
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,880
'We never read a forwarded message.'

722
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:26,240
'But we were sending Manjari messages
wishing her good morning everyday.'

723
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:27,960
I'll pay the bill.
- No. I will pay it.

724
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,320
I will pay it.
- No, I will.

725
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,720
Shut up. I will pay the bill.

726
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:31,640
I will pay it.
- No.

727
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,480
I will pay it this time.
- I will pay it.

728
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:36,760
Fine! You pay the bill!

729
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,120
You pay the bill.

730
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,880
You pay it every time.
Pay it today as well.

731
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:41,840
It's always me!

732
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,040
'Someone has rightly said'

733
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:49,200
'that everything is fair
in love and war.'

734
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,840
'A bizarre fight had begun'

735
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:53,960
'to get the first bite of the cake.'

736
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,040
What's up, Namit?

737
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,160
You look dapper today.

738
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,240
Listen.

739
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:13,880
Whose wedding are you going to attend?

740
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,880
Mine. Do you have a problem?

741
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:18,080
Why would I have a problem?

742
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,960
Listen. Don't get carried away.

743
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:22,080
I know everything. Do you get that?

744
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,440
It's Manjari's birthday.

745
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,440
And the trinity is all geared up
to celebrate it.

746
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,760
Awesome!

747
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,320
That's an amazing shirt!
- Isn't it?

748
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,240
It seems to be a new one.
- It's brand new.

749
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,240
Abeer, you know what?

750
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:40,080
Manjari loves roses.

751
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,200
What are you saying?

752
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,480
Why don't you

753
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:46,200
ask your dad to plant
a rose garden in the village.

754
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,320
You took the words out of my mouth.

755
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,680
And I'm going to
break your heart shortly.

756
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:54,600
We are almost there.

757
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,880
I am opening my eyes now.
- No. Not yet.

758
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,120
Wait a while.

759
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:02,040
Can I open them now?
- Have some patience, Manjari.

760
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:12,480
Can I open my eyes now?

761
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:14,280
Yes!

762
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,800
"Happy birthday to you!"

763
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:20,760
"Happy birthday to you!"

764
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:24,080
"Happy birthday, dear Manjari!"

765
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,960
"Happy birthday to you!"

766
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:29,960
"Happy birthday to you!"

767
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:38,960
It's really pretty.

768
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,680
Who decorated this place.
- I did!

769
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:45,840
We did.

770
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:46,880
Manjari.

771
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:54,000
I wish you a very happy birthday.

772
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:56,520
And here's a small gift.

773
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:57,920
What are you doing?

774
00:43:58,080 --> 00:43:59,560
What? I'm sorry, pal.

775
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:02,600
I brought your expensive wine.

776
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:06,200
But I couldn't have gifted her
a bottle of cheap rum.

777
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:09,280
My friend, she doesn't drink.
Do you get that?

778
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,480
It's okay.

779
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:13,640
I don't drink.
But who says I can't drink at all?

780
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:15,480
And it's a gift, after all.

781
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:16,760
Thanks, Vikram.

782
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:20,040
"Happy birthday to you!"

783
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:23,600
"Happy birthday to you!"

784
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:28,400
"Happy birthday, dear Manjari!"

785
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:31,640
"Happy birthday to you!"

786
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:33,680
'When it was time to cut the cake,'

787
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,280
'the girls were counting the candles.'

788
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,360
'And we were feeling nervous wondering'

789
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,880
'who would get the first bite.'

790
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:56,280
'Manjari cut the cake'

791
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:59,480
'and dashed our hopes!'

792
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:02,520
'She took the first bite of the cake.'

793
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:29,600
'Manjari was very happy.'

794
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:32,600
'We tried to share her happiness.'

795
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:34,320
Let's dance, pal.
- 'But we couldn't.'

796
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,480
Get lost!
- Hey!

797
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:42,440
'Perhaps that's why
we vent our frustration

798
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:45,120
'on Arman and his gang
when they gatecrashed the party.'

799
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:05,320
'Arman had come there for a drink.'

800
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:07,320
'But he got humiliated and left.'

801
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:10,560
'Manjari kept drinking'

802
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:12,560
'and dancing.'

803
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:22,520
'People started getting tired and left.'

804
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:24,680
'And only the four of us'

805
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:26,040
'were still there.'

806
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:32,880
Who stopped the music?

807
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:35,560
Where did everyone go?

808
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:38,760
You guys are still here!

809
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:43,200
You know what?

810
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:44,960
When I was a kid,

811
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:49,640
my mom used to celebrate
my birthday every year.

812
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:54,960
She would decorate the entire house.

813
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:58,880
But after her demise...

814
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:04,840
After her demise, no one remembers

815
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:07,760
my birthday.

816
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:10,840
You know what?

817
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:13,720
People tell me...

818
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,760
That I resemble my mom.

819
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,440
She is an emotional girl.

820
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,040
She reminds me of my mom.

821
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:35,840
She is emotional and out.

822
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:39,720
We can't take her back
to the girls' hostel.

823
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:41,840
What do we do now?

824
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:45,360
Hi!

825
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:47,960
What is your name?

826
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:51,920
Are you French?

827
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:54,480
I am Indian.

828
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,240
The bottle is empty.

829
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,120
Give me some more.

830
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:22,640
Manjari, you have had enough.
You don't need another drink.

831
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,360
Let her drink.

832
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:27,520
She seems happy.

833
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:29,720
Let her be happy.

834
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:37,640
Can I say something?

835
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:42,920
If she gets drunk,

836
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:46,680
she will reveal the truth.

837
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:50,960
Where do you get
such disgusting ideas from?

838
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,600
I didn't say that.

839
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:55,800
Everyone says so.
- I see.

840
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,520
Why are you guys sad?

841
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:00,880
Want to hear a joke?

842
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:04,840
She is drunk.

843
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:07,360
Let's ask her.

844
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:12,880
Why don't you ask her
if you are so eager?

845
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:14,880
Me?

846
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:20,520
Shut up.

847
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:22,560
Where are you going?

848
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:30,360
The bottle is empty.

849
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:33,480
Thank you.

850
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:35,120
Cheers.

851
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:39,640
Can I ask you something?

852
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:41,760
Sure.

853
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:45,760
Who do you love the most

854
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:49,480
amongst the three of us?

855
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:52,040
Who do you love the most?

856
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,040
Love?

857
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:01,720
I love all three of you.

858
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:08,080
All of us!

859
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,320
Yes.

860
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:11,920
All three of you.

861
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:17,120
Manjari, you don't get it.

862
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:21,280
Listen. We know that you like all of us.

863
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:24,400
But...

864
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:28,720
Who do you love the most?

865
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:33,800
All three of you.

866
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:35,840
I love the three of you.

867
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:44,440
Manjari, I know you love me.

868
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:46,840
What's wrong with you?

869
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:48,720
How can you say that?

870
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:50,360
You guys tried.

871
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,080
It's my turn now.

872
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,160
We know that you like us.

873
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:02,520
But who would you fall in love with?

874
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:06,160
All three of you.

875
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:10,600
I love the three of you equally.

876
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:33,520
You know what?

877
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:37,960
I didn't have any friends.

878
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:43,960
Because there were very few girls
in my neighbourhood.

879
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:46,440
And...

880
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:53,960
And I never had the courage
to befriend boys.

881
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:01,320
Girls are not afraid
of befriending boys.

882
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:05,960
They are scared of...

883
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:09,560
They are just scared
of their intentions.

884
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:11,880
So...

885
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:14,560
You know what?

886
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:17,560
Ever since we became friends,

887
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:19,800
do you know what people say?

888
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:25,040
They... They say...

889
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:27,720
The three of you

890
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:30,600
are trying to woo me.

891
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:37,280
But I never listen to them.

892
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:40,960
Because I know

893
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:45,480
that you are my true friends.

894
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:51,760
You are my true friends, right?

895
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:55,040
Tell me.

896
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:01,800
You are my friends, right?

897
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:09,720
I am feeling sleepy.

898
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:19,960
Come.
- Be careful.

899
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:24,520
Come over here.

900
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:27,280
Sit here.

901
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:28,520
I am drunk...

902
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:30,160
Yes. Sit here.

903
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:34,120
Go to sleep.

904
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:44,680
'Manjari fell asleep.'

905
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:48,120
'But we stayed awake all night'

906
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:50,880
'thinking that these questions'

907
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:52,920
'might estrange our friend from us.'

908
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:05,880
Is it 9 o' clock?

909
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:10,120
Want some tea?

910
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:25,360
I will get going.

911
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:29,800
I will see you in the evening.

912
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:36,200
She doesn't remember anything.

913
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:39,840
But we should tell her the truth.

914
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:41,360
Why?

915
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:44,360
Let's forget what happened last night.

916
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:57,480
Did you talk to Manjari?

917
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,880
She was going to come with us
to watch the film.

918
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:02,160
We called her,
but she didn't receive the call.

919
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:04,360
Is everything okay?

920
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:06,080
How would I know?

921
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:10,040
There they are! The trinity!

922
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:13,600
There they are!

923
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:14,920
What happened to them?

924
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:17,960
Wow! You guys are amazing!

925
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:20,560
Guys, you turned out
to be quite secretive.

926
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:22,200
You must have had fun.

927
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:23,360
What are they saying?

928
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:27,440
Forget it. They are stupid.
They keep talking rubbish.

929
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:30,560
Be seated. There is some glitch
in the projector.

930
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:32,320
The film will begin shortly.

931
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:33,520
Thanks for the cooperation.

932
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:35,320
What happened? Why are you smiling?

933
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:39,120
God knows what it is. Stupid people!

934
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:41,400
It's those three guys.

935
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:43,960
Where is Manjari?
- What happened?

936
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:46,920
I have got Rs 2000.

937
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:49,560
Hey. Look over there.

938
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,360
'Ladies and gentlemen,'

939
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:53,440
'brace yourselves.'

940
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:55,760
'One girl and her three admirers.'

941
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:58,600
'One wasn't enough for her.
So, she chose all three.'

942
00:55:58,680 --> 00:55:59,760
'Who will you choose?'

943
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:03,880
'I will choose all three of you.'

944
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:04,960
'Who will you choose?'

945
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:08,120
'I will choose all three of you.'

946
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:10,320
Choose us as well.
- 'Who will you choose?'

947
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:15,040
'I will choose all three of you.'

948
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:16,960
'Who will you choose?'

949
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,840
'I will choose all three of you.'

950
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:21,960
She chose all three of them!

951
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:26,280
'How can someone be so disgusting?'

952
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:28,680
'The other night,
when Manjari was in our room,'

953
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:32,520
'Arman recorded everything through
the window and made this video.'

954
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:35,120
'It had gone viral in college.'

955
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:38,120
'Who will you choose?'

956
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:42,240
'I will choose all three of you.'

957
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:13,680
Mistake...

958
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:15,880
I am sorry. I made a mistake.

959
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:18,120
Sorry.

960
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:21,120
I made a mistake.

961
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:24,800
Sorry...

962
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:06,760
Ma'am, we wanted to meet Manjari.

963
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:13,800
'Manjari locked herself
in her hostel room.'

964
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:16,200
'What else could she do?'

965
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:19,480
'How could she face everyone?'

966
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:21,400
'The number you are
trying to call...'

967
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:22,560
She disconnected it.

968
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:27,080
'Everyone had one question.'

969
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:29,920
'What was a drunk girl'

970
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:33,360
'doing with three guys
in the room all night?'

971
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:35,040
'Who will you choose?'

972
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:39,560
'I will choose all three of you.'

973
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:41,240
'Who will you choose?'

974
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:45,680
'I will choose all three of you.'

975
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:47,160
'Who will you choose?'

976
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:56,800
'The number you are trying to
reach is currently unavailable.'

977
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:58,120
'Please try again later.'

978
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:15,920
'We couldn't sleep for two nights.'

979
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:18,320
'Everyone else was awake as well.'

980
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:20,960
'They kept sharing the video.'

981
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:23,960
'The video had changed
our lives forever.'

982
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,400
Mr Jagganath,

983
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:43,840
please think about her career.

984
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:51,600
Enough of studies!

985
00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:00,160
Manjari's dad is here to take her away.

986
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:01,360
And you guys sleeping!

987
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:06,400
Manjari.

988
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:08,720
Manjari, where are you going?

989
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:10,400
Manjari.

990
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:12,080
Manjari, listen to me.
Where are you going?

991
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:13,240
Manjari, hear us out.

992
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:15,240
Manjari.
- Arman made that video.

993
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:16,800
We aren't at fault, Manjari.

994
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:19,360
Manjari, Arman is responsible for it.

995
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:21,280
Why should you pay for his mistake?

996
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:23,520
Manjari, hear me out. I can explain.

997
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:24,960
Everything will be fine, Manjari.

998
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:26,520
Please listen. We aren't at fault.

999
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:28,080
Manjari, we were at fault.

1000
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:29,600
We were at fault, Manjari.

1001
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:31,080
What are you saying?
- Let me speak!

1002
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:32,760
What are you...
- Let me speak!

1003
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:38,960
Manjari, we were at fault as well.

1004
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:44,760
We didn't do anything
intentionally, Manjari.

1005
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:48,400
We... We wanted to know

1006
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:53,720
who you loved among the three of us.

1007
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:58,160
It all went wrong because of that.

1008
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:00,160
You...

1009
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:01,920
You were blind drunk.

1010
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:03,920
And... And it was quite late.

1011
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:05,760
So, we couldn't drop you off
at your hostel.

1012
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:07,040
We brought you to our room.

1013
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:09,840
You had a few more drinks over there.

1014
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:11,960
We thought you would tell us the truth

1015
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:14,080
as you were intoxicated.

1016
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:16,320
We kept trying to ask you

1017
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:17,680
who among the three...

1018
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:23,080
Who you loved the most
among the three of us.

1019
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:26,240
Manjari, we didn't intend to hurt you.

1020
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:28,520
We have made a terrible mistake.

1021
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:30,960
We are sorry. Please forgive us.

1022
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:33,400
Manjari, please.

1023
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:35,400
Manjari!

1024
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:37,440
Manjari, listen to me.

1025
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,040
No such thing happened.

1026
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:41,440
I can explain. Please listen to me.

1027
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:54,880
Was it necessary to tell her the truth?

1028
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:58,040
Was it necessary?
- It was. That is why I told her.

1029
01:01:58,120 --> 01:01:59,680
But did you have to tell her today?

1030
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:01,680
Why are you getting angry?

1031
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:02,920
We can hit back.

1032
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,120
But you have no brains.

1033
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:06,360
Whose idea was it to get her drunk?

1034
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:09,040
Wow! You remembered that very soon.

1035
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:10,960
Yes, I got her drunk.

1036
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:12,640
I got her drunk.

1037
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:14,040
But whose liquor was it?

1038
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:15,320
Surjo!
- Who got it?

1039
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:16,640
Surjo!
- Be quiet!

1040
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:19,440
The two of you suggested that
we should bring her to our room!

1041
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:21,720
You should have stopped us!
- You should have said that.

1042
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:23,560
Quiet, both of you!
It's all my fault! Okay?

1043
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:25,920
Yes. You became a hero
by telling her the truth!

1044
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:26,920
Are you satisfied now?

1045
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:28,440
Wasn't a slap enough for you?

1046
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:29,720
How dare you push me!
- I did!

1047
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:30,720
Namit! Namit!

1048
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:32,120
Surjo! Surjo!

1049
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:33,840
Surjo, leave him!

1050
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:35,320
Surjo, leave...

1051
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:39,080
Hey! Move!

1052
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:41,400
Leave him!

1053
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:42,800
Step back!

1054
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:44,000
Step back!

1055
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:45,560
What? Why are you staring at me?

1056
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:47,880
Surjo!
- To hell with your friendship!

1057
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:49,960
Move!
- What kind of a friend are you?

1058
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:51,240
Is this how friends are?
- Don't talk to me!

1059
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:52,760
Don't talk to me! Move!
- You go away!

1060
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:53,720
Move!

1061
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:55,160
And claim to be my friends!

1062
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:57,320
Don't show me your face again!
- Yes, I won't!

1063
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:58,280
I don't even want to!

1064
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:00,160
I don't need a friend like you.
- Me neither.

1065
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:02,800
He calls himself my friend!

1066
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:05,840
I am glad this friendship ended.

1067
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:11,960
Go away!

1068
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:14,200
You go away as well!

1069
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:31,040
'Arman accused us
of attacking him with acid.'

1070
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,600
'The college expelled us without
letting us explain.'

1071
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:40,920
'Einstein said
that time was relative.'

1072
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:44,520
'We didn't understand it
when we read it in books.'

1073
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:46,800
'But he was right.'

1074
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:50,800
'Good times seem to pass by quickly.'

1075
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:52,680
'And bad times'

1076
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:55,400
'seem to be unending.'

1077
01:04:57,080 --> 01:04:59,440
'It had been four years since
we got expelled from college.'

1078
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:02,160
'But if felt like life'

1079
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:04,960
'had come to a standstill
at the college gate.'

1080
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:06,880
Open your mouth.

1081
01:05:09,560 --> 01:05:10,520
Close it.

1082
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:12,320
You have bad breath.

1083
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:15,360
I am prescribing a tablet.
Take it twice a day.

1084
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:17,840
Don't take all the tablets together.

1085
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:19,080
Yes, I won't.

1086
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:21,000
You have to pay Rs 50.

1087
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:23,960
The tablets cost Rs 20
and Rs 30 is my fee.

1088
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:25,800
Rs 50!
- Yes.

1089
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:27,640
But you are a quack doctor!

1090
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:29,840
How dare you call me a quack!

1091
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:30,920
What else should I say?

1092
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:32,520
Just because you stayed
in the city for two years,

1093
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:34,160
you think you are a doctor!

1094
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:35,800
I know everything.

1095
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:38,440
You were expelled from the college.

1096
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:41,960
Pack the tablets. And here is Rs 20.

1097
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:44,480
Do you get it?

1098
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:48,960
Learn to pack the tablets properly.

1099
01:06:11,480 --> 01:06:12,600
Excuse me, ma'am.

1100
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:19,280
Ma'am.

1101
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:21,080
I have been waiting
for the past two hours.

1102
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:23,600
There is no patient. Let me go inside.

1103
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:25,440
The doctor is busy right now.

1104
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:28,160
Ma'am, if you tell him
that Abeer Khan is here,

1105
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:29,360
he will recognise me.

1106
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:30,960
We went to the same college.

1107
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:32,240
I already told him.

1108
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:42,600
Excuse me, sir! Hello!

1109
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:44,120
Wait, sir!

1110
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:46,920
What's going on?

1111
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:49,480
I have been waiting for you
for the past two hours.

1112
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:51,040
And you are busy on your phone!

1113
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:53,440
Can't you see I am busy?

1114
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:55,400
Come back after 10 minutes.

1115
01:06:56,920 --> 01:06:58,440
Why are you behaving like that?

1116
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:00,640
I am doing my job.

1117
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:02,560
How can you forget

1118
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:05,320
that I helped you pass
the first year in college?

1119
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:08,480
Now you are sitting in your dad's clinic
and behaving arrogantly.

1120
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:14,560
Atul Jain.

1121
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:16,640
MBBS.

1122
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:19,080
Abeer Khan. MR.

1123
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:20,600
MR.

1124
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:23,880
You are a salesman
and you should behave like one.

1125
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:25,480
Okay?

1126
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:40,800
I won't pay. Do whatever you want!

1127
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:43,320
And if you cut the connection,
I will beat you to a pulp!

1128
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:44,440
Do you get it?

1129
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:47,160
What happened? Who are you yelling at?

1130
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:49,920
No.

1131
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:51,720
No one.

1132
01:07:53,040 --> 01:07:54,440
Forget about it.

1133
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:57,280
I have made 'nimona'.
Would you like to have some?

1134
01:07:58,320 --> 01:07:59,960
It tastes better when it's hot.

1135
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:02,600
I am not hungry. You may eat it.

1136
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:06,320
Mom came to me.

1137
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:09,120
She said that you had become weak.

1138
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:10,760
She scolded me.

1139
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:13,680
She said that I don't feed you well.

1140
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:14,760
Well,

1141
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:16,640
she doesn't know

1142
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:19,120
that I cook various dishes,

1143
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:21,440
but you don't eat at all.

1144
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:23,560
I will talk to your mom. Okay?

1145
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:37,160
I have a backache since morning.

1146
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:39,840
Please check.

1147
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,160
Backache!

1148
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:47,000
Over here?

1149
01:08:52,440 --> 01:08:54,880
If you keep your eyes closed,

1150
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:57,120
how will you see anything?

1151
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:01,960
You are shy of your wife!

1152
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:05,280
How will you treat me?

1153
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:06,920
You have a sprain.

1154
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:11,280
Take this ointment.
Apply it and your pain will vanish.

1155
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:47,480
Hello. Yes, mom?

1156
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:51,760
Mom, what are you saying?

1157
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:53,400
Don't you know how busy I am?

1158
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:55,680
I won't get a day off to meet a girl
and you know that.

1159
01:09:56,240 --> 01:09:58,560
I am not asking you to take the day off.

1160
01:09:58,840 --> 01:10:00,960
I have sent you her picture
on WhatsApp. See it.

1161
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:02,680
Her name is Noor.

1162
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,080
And she looks like an angel.

1163
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:08,880
Mom, you know my answer, yet...

1164
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:11,280
She is from Agra.

1165
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:13,760
We will get to see the Taj Mahal
when we go to meet her.

1166
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:15,440
Okay. I will talk to you
when I get home.

1167
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:33,600
'I need your help.'

1168
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:39,240
'I sent you a message as
I didn't have your number.'

1169
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:41,480
'Can you come to Noida?'

1170
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:43,080
'Medical college.'

1171
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:44,800
'Please help.'

1172
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:47,520
'It's quite urgent.'

1173
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:49,800
'Manjari.'

1174
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:51,680
'Manjari.'

1175
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:24,680
The ointment was quite effective.

1176
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:26,320
My pain vanished.

1177
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:31,480
Listen. Stand and mop the floor.
Don't squat.

1178
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:32,920
Okay?

1179
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:34,960
Are you preparing to go somewhere?

1180
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:36,920
Yes, I am going out for a few days.

1181
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:39,480
Had you told me earlier,

1182
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:41,360
I would've ironed my sari...
- Not you!

1183
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:43,240
I am going alone.

1184
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:45,000
I have got some work.

1185
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:52,600
Abeer.

1186
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:55,000
Did you see Noor's picture?

1187
01:11:58,360 --> 01:11:59,360
Yes.

1188
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:00,880
How is she?

1189
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:04,240
What do you mean, dad?

1190
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:07,760
You know my answer.

1191
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:10,320
At least meet her once.

1192
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:13,280
She is Mr Siddhiqui's daughter.

1193
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:17,160
Their house is near the Taj Mahal.

1194
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:20,320
Mom, are you interested
in Taj Mahal or the girl?

1195
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:23,040
Did you hear that?

1196
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:27,200
He doesn't meet any girl in Kanpur.

1197
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:30,920
I don't think he would go to Agra
to meet a girl!

1198
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:37,960
Fine.

1199
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:42,560
But can I meet her first?

1200
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:45,840
Is Manjari Mishra here?

1201
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:47,000
No.

1202
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:49,080
Please check.
- Inquire at the admin office.

1203
01:13:50,120 --> 01:13:51,560
Nobody wants to work.

1204
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:04,760
Where is the admin office?

1205
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:18,360
Hi.

1206
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:29,760
Hi.

1207
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:35,680
How are you?
- So...

1208
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:38,120
So what?

1209
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:40,440
How is everything?

1210
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:45,480
All good.

1211
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:52,080
What happened?

1212
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:54,960
Are you peeing or just standing there?

1213
01:15:06,040 --> 01:15:08,400
Did you forget hygiene
when you quit being a doctor?

1214
01:15:10,240 --> 01:15:11,280
Wash your hands at least.

1215
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:22,440
Well,

1216
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:25,280
my company has launched
some new medicines.

1217
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:28,600
I'm here to promote them.

1218
01:15:30,920 --> 01:15:31,840
What about you?

1219
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:35,320
My dad...

1220
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:36,480
What happened to your dad?

1221
01:15:37,720 --> 01:15:38,880
Nothing happened to him.

1222
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:41,560
Dad had to tend to some business
at the hospital.

1223
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:43,880
Okay.

1224
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:50,720
By the way,

1225
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:52,960
your beard looks nice.

1226
01:15:55,560 --> 01:15:56,480
Your beard...

1227
01:15:58,200 --> 01:16:00,160
My beard is shoddy.

1228
01:16:00,440 --> 01:16:01,680
It felt good to see yours.

1229
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:11,040
I knew the world was round.

1230
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:14,440
But I've found its centre today.

1231
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:26,200
Oh, man.

1232
01:16:27,320 --> 01:16:29,560
You could've told me when
the two of you got the message.

1233
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:32,120
I wouldn't have travelled so far.

1234
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:36,520
How could we do that?

1235
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:41,320
Have you sent a message or called us
even once in four years?

1236
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:45,240
As if you gave me many missed calls.

1237
01:16:46,720 --> 01:16:47,640
Idiot!

1238
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:49,640
You have changed.

1239
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:55,080
You've started pronouncing
the word 'call' properly.

1240
01:16:55,680 --> 01:16:56,560
Yes.

1241
01:16:56,680 --> 01:16:59,000
But I still call Shakespeare 'Sexpier'

1242
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:03,040
Surjo,

1243
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:05,480
can we talk about your progress later?

1244
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:06,880
Let's try to find Manjari first.

1245
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:08,320
I inquired at the hospital.

1246
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:11,920
No one knows a thing.

1247
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:17,720
I am not sure if she will
recognise us or not.

1248
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:20,880
'Manjari might not recognise us'

1249
01:17:21,640 --> 01:17:23,560
'But it was very difficult
to recognise her now.'

1250
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:24,760
Excuse me.

1251
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:27,000
Have Aarambh Sharma's reports come in?

1252
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:28,960
Come back tomorrow.

1253
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:32,360
Yesterday I was told to come by today.

1254
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:34,280
Now, you are telling me to
come back tomorrow.

1255
01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:35,560
What's going on over here?

1256
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:37,920
Your reports are with Pathology.

1257
01:17:38,360 --> 01:17:40,440
You can collect them from there
if you're in a hurry.

1258
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:59,760
'For the past four years I must
have wondered a million times'

1259
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:02,160
'how Manjari would be,'

1260
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:04,040
'and where would she be.'

1261
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,600
'But I don't know why I never had
the courage to find the answer.'

1262
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:09,640
'I was scared'

1263
01:18:10,720 --> 01:18:13,400
'that it might create more problem
in her life.'

1264
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:38,400
Hi, Manjari.

1265
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:44,960
How are you?

1266
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:50,640
You're grown up quite a bit,
haven't you?

1267
01:18:56,680 --> 01:18:57,960
We got your message.

1268
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:00,720
On Facebook.

1269
01:19:01,240 --> 01:19:04,160
We didn't have your phone number or
we would've called before coming over.

1270
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:07,240
Yes.

1271
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:08,640
We saw your message.

1272
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:10,280
That's why...

1273
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:12,480
I didn't call anyone.

1274
01:19:16,040 --> 01:19:17,080
Are you still angry?

1275
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:20,760
Manjari, we...

1276
01:19:22,240 --> 01:19:23,480
We were your friends back then,

1277
01:19:24,720 --> 01:19:25,800
and we still are.

1278
01:19:26,280 --> 01:19:27,480
I never had any friends,

1279
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:29,040
nor do I want to make any.

1280
01:19:39,880 --> 01:19:41,520
'I never had any friends,'

1281
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:43,360
'nor do I want to make any.'

1282
01:19:45,560 --> 01:19:46,880
Give me a tight slap!

1283
01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:49,040
I don't understand what's going on here.

1284
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:50,640
She's a strange woman.

1285
01:19:51,640 --> 01:19:52,960
She says that she didn't call us.

1286
01:19:55,480 --> 01:19:56,800
She's definitely in trouble.

1287
01:19:58,360 --> 01:19:59,360
Or why would she call us?

1288
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:01,640
But she just said she didn't call us.

1289
01:20:01,720 --> 01:20:04,280
Who called us here if she didn't?

1290
01:20:11,240 --> 01:20:12,440
Hi.
- Hi.

1291
01:20:12,640 --> 01:20:15,120
Which patient's reports did
that lady just collect?

1292
01:20:18,760 --> 01:20:19,960
Who is that?

1293
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:23,040
A patient, dear.

1294
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:25,160
I can see that.

1295
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:30,720
But who is he?

1296
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:33,520
Could he be Manjari's husband?

1297
01:20:35,480 --> 01:20:36,680
Her husband!

1298
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:38,800
No, guys.

1299
01:20:39,080 --> 01:20:40,600
He looks quite old.

1300
01:20:41,560 --> 01:20:43,720
He could be her relative.
- Yes.

1301
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:45,800
He could be, but...

1302
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:48,160
I think he's her husband.

1303
01:20:49,680 --> 01:20:52,400
But why would Manjari marry an old man?

1304
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:54,800
Well then, why not me?

1305
01:20:56,120 --> 01:20:57,240
What nonsense!

1306
01:20:57,440 --> 01:20:58,360
What?

1307
01:20:58,480 --> 01:20:59,480
What if she comes by now?

1308
01:21:00,200 --> 01:21:01,440
Do you think I'm scared of her?

1309
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:03,200
I'm not scared of her.

1310
01:21:04,440 --> 01:21:06,400
She's the one who called us here.

1311
01:21:07,960 --> 01:21:08,840
I told you.

1312
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:11,680
I didn't call anyone.

1313
01:21:13,640 --> 01:21:15,280
Manjari, there's some confusion.

1314
01:21:15,680 --> 01:21:16,960
There's no confusion.

1315
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:19,280
That's my husband.

1316
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:23,440
Yes.

1317
01:21:23,680 --> 01:21:25,240
I told them

1318
01:21:25,640 --> 01:21:26,760
that he's your husband.

1319
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:30,880
You didn't invite us to your wedding.

1320
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:35,240
Well, I didn't invite you
to mine either.

1321
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:37,120
The score is settled.

1322
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:38,880
No, it isn't.

1323
01:21:40,680 --> 01:21:42,360
Whatever happened four years ago

1324
01:21:43,480 --> 01:21:45,560
can never be set right.

1325
01:21:57,760 --> 01:22:01,120
Everybody changes after marriage.

1326
01:22:04,440 --> 01:22:05,880
Manjari is no different.

1327
01:22:08,680 --> 01:22:10,040
You're married too.

1328
01:22:15,400 --> 01:22:16,640
Think again, guys.

1329
01:22:19,080 --> 01:22:21,280
Do you want to head out today
or after a couple of days?

1330
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:22,920
What's there to think about?

1331
01:22:23,560 --> 01:22:26,360
No one has ever called me
and insulted me so badly.

1332
01:22:27,560 --> 01:22:28,640
Friends!

1333
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:32,800
Since she hasn't called us,

1334
01:22:33,880 --> 01:22:34,840
what will we do here?

1335
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:37,760
Don't you think

1336
01:22:39,480 --> 01:22:41,160
we should talk to Manjari again?

1337
01:22:45,240 --> 01:22:46,400
Listen to me.

1338
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:50,360
We should meet Manjari
and apologise to her.

1339
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:51,920
Hey, Abeer.

1340
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:53,520
Stop talking nonsense!

1341
01:22:55,320 --> 01:22:58,200
She can't just blame us.
It was her fault too.

1342
01:23:00,720 --> 01:23:01,880
He sports a moustache,

1343
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:03,280
but he'll never mend his ways.

1344
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:04,480
He will always be stubborn.

1345
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:05,440
Yes, Abeer.

1346
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:07,640
You can call me a spoilt brat
or a stubborn man.

1347
01:23:08,480 --> 01:23:09,640
I won't apologise.

1348
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:12,400
He must be joking.
- Stop it, guys.

1349
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:20,840
Forget about it. You guys may leave.

1350
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:27,040
How could you go back
just like that, guys?

1351
01:23:27,400 --> 01:23:30,080
At least, give me a kiss
before you leave, guys.

1352
01:23:33,720 --> 01:23:34,880
Welcome, guys.

1353
01:23:36,440 --> 01:23:38,200
Let's sip on some hot ginger tea.

1354
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:40,600
We just had some.

1355
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:41,760
Why bother?

1356
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:43,560
Have another one then. It's ginger tea.

1357
01:23:43,680 --> 01:23:45,960
You'll love it. You'll feel fresh.

1358
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:47,040
Have a sip.

1359
01:23:47,160 --> 01:23:48,040
Well, what's going on?

1360
01:23:48,280 --> 01:23:49,200
What about you?

1361
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:51,080
You have changed completely.

1362
01:23:52,200 --> 01:23:53,280
Life goes on, guys.

1363
01:23:53,800 --> 01:23:54,640
Yes.

1364
01:23:55,360 --> 01:23:57,280
Vikram has a cup in his hands
instead of a glass.

1365
01:23:57,800 --> 01:23:58,800
That doesn't look right.

1366
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:00,880
So, you still remember.

1367
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:05,680
What happened, guys? What made
all of you come here so suddenly?

1368
01:24:07,160 --> 01:24:08,000
Forget it.

1369
01:24:10,720 --> 01:24:11,880
We came here to meet Manjari.

1370
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:14,440
I see.

1371
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:16,040
Did you meet Manjari?

1372
01:24:16,680 --> 01:24:17,600
Yes.

1373
01:24:17,720 --> 01:24:19,200
She was the one who called us here.

1374
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:20,640
Did you meet her?

1375
01:24:21,320 --> 01:24:23,480
Yes, I met her yesterday.

1376
01:24:24,520 --> 01:24:25,760
The poor thing is very worried.

1377
01:24:27,480 --> 01:24:29,480
Help her out if you can, guys.

1378
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:31,800
She's in big trouble.

1379
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:32,840
And she's all alone.

1380
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:34,280
Alone!

1381
01:24:34,720 --> 01:24:36,200
What do you mean?

1382
01:24:36,680 --> 01:24:37,640
Her brother

1383
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:40,360
and father got her married immediately
after she finished college.

1384
01:24:40,640 --> 01:24:42,120
Her husband is a lot older than her.

1385
01:24:43,480 --> 01:24:44,440
Yes.

1386
01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:46,920
He must be 8 to 10 years older than her.

1387
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:49,480
Yes, it seems so.

1388
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:52,400
His condition is very serious.

1389
01:24:54,040 --> 01:24:57,960
The poor thing is just running from
pillar to post after his accident.

1390
01:24:59,080 --> 01:25:00,840
She doesn't have a family either.

1391
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:06,520
Help her out if you can, guys.

1392
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:09,920
'The more Vikram told us about Manjari,'

1393
01:25:11,200 --> 01:25:13,520
'the more we postponed our plans
to leave the hospital.'

1394
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:18,520
'Manjari's husband, Aarambh,
was fighting for his life.'

1395
01:25:19,720 --> 01:25:20,640
'But, Manjari,'

1396
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:22,440
'was fighting life itself.'

1397
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:28,600
Don't worry. Everything will be alright.

1398
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:29,880
Okay.

1399
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:36,840
What did the doctor say?

1400
01:25:37,640 --> 01:25:39,040
He will have to undergo surgery.

1401
01:25:41,240 --> 01:25:42,600
But now's not the right time.

1402
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:44,320
They'll do it after some time.

1403
01:25:45,320 --> 01:25:47,680
Surgery won't solve anything.

1404
01:25:48,240 --> 01:25:50,440
Listen to me. Perform a 'puja'

1405
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:52,600
Lord Shani's temple
which would cost Rs 5001.

1406
01:25:54,440 --> 01:25:55,280
Listen to me.

1407
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:57,400
It's quite simple actually.

1408
01:25:57,520 --> 01:25:59,320
Lord Shani is displeased with her.
That's all.

1409
01:26:04,240 --> 01:26:05,560
Something important has come up.

1410
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:08,200
If you are done here, can we leave?

1411
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:09,680
How can we leave?

1412
01:26:10,240 --> 01:26:13,040
Didn't you hear the doctor say
that he will have to undergo surgery?

1413
01:26:13,120 --> 01:26:14,080
They will have to do it.

1414
01:26:14,920 --> 01:26:16,080
It's not happening right now.

1415
01:26:19,120 --> 01:26:20,840
Yes, you may leave.

1416
01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:22,040
It's okay.

1417
01:26:22,640 --> 01:26:24,680
Isn't tea available
in a big hospital like this?

1418
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:26,800
She didn't even offer us a cup of tea.

1419
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:30,200
If she had no money,
she could have borrowed some from me.

1420
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:33,240
Why were you trying to be a hero?

1421
01:26:35,240 --> 01:26:36,920
Do you know how much
the surgery will cost?

1422
01:26:41,080 --> 01:26:42,520
You have forgotten about me.

1423
01:26:43,960 --> 01:26:44,920
Tell me something.

1424
01:26:45,320 --> 01:26:47,040
What will you get for me from there?

1425
01:26:49,200 --> 01:26:50,200
What do you want?

1426
01:26:51,680 --> 01:26:54,200
I've heard that
the clothes there are excellent.

1427
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:56,760
Will you get me a cotton sari?

1428
01:26:57,120 --> 01:27:00,680
I'm tired of wearing
this polyester sari, dear.

1429
01:27:02,200 --> 01:27:03,480
Which colour do you want?

1430
01:27:05,320 --> 01:27:06,800
Red? Yellow? Green?

1431
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:10,880
Whichever colour you like.

1432
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:15,400
Is it compulsory to do all that
after marriage?

1433
01:27:16,080 --> 01:27:17,080
How would I know?

1434
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:20,720
I'm not married.

1435
01:27:22,040 --> 01:27:23,280
You talk a lot.

1436
01:27:24,680 --> 01:27:25,600
I'm hanging up.

1437
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:29,640
She seems to love you a lot.

1438
01:27:32,720 --> 01:27:34,440
You could've invited us to the wedding.

1439
01:27:36,440 --> 01:27:37,360
Weddings

1440
01:27:37,960 --> 01:27:39,160
are for relatives

1441
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:41,400
and friends.

1442
01:27:42,160 --> 01:27:43,880
Some people invite their enemies too.

1443
01:27:46,520 --> 01:27:48,120
But all of us here have huge egos.

1444
01:27:52,080 --> 01:27:53,880
You could've given either of us a call.

1445
01:27:56,640 --> 01:27:58,240
Couldn't you afford it?

1446
01:28:23,200 --> 01:28:25,400
'They're great. They're really good.'

1447
01:28:26,120 --> 01:28:28,280
'Manjari, you've already had
two 'rasgullas'.'

1448
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:30,080
'Leave some for us.'

1449
01:28:30,360 --> 01:28:31,480
'All of them are mine.'

1450
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:33,320
'Go and get some if you want.'

1451
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:35,000
'There are none left.'

1452
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:37,240
'They said you bought all of them.'

1453
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:39,480
'I have a question.'

1454
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:40,800
'Do people have dessert'

1455
01:28:40,920 --> 01:28:42,360
'before or after a meal?'

1456
01:28:42,840 --> 01:28:44,960
'Forget it, Abeer. We aren't fortunate
enough to have such delicacies.'

1457
01:28:45,080 --> 01:28:46,320
'All we will get is regular food.
Come on.'

1458
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:47,360
'No.'

1459
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:48,600
'I don't want to eat it.'

1460
01:28:48,680 --> 01:28:49,640
'I'm fasting.'

1461
01:28:49,800 --> 01:28:51,440
'I won't eat if there's no dessert.'

1462
01:28:51,520 --> 01:28:53,440
'I'm fasting too. I won't eat either.'

1463
01:28:54,040 --> 01:28:55,080
'Okay. Here you go.'

1464
01:28:57,040 --> 01:28:59,200
'Oh, God!
- Save some for me.'

1465
01:29:04,680 --> 01:29:05,880
'Won't you have some?'

1466
01:29:14,080 --> 01:29:15,800
'What are you thinking? Come on, eat.'

1467
01:29:16,120 --> 01:29:17,200
'Mom says'

1468
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:19,680
'if something is very sweet,'

1469
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:23,160
'there's a chance that
ants might infest it.'

1470
01:29:23,480 --> 01:29:24,840
'I won't let any ants come close.'

1471
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:16,000
What happened, doctor?

1472
01:30:16,120 --> 01:30:19,080
There's been internal bleeding. We'll
have to give him a blood transfusion.

1473
01:30:22,120 --> 01:30:23,040
'Manjari remembered'

1474
01:30:23,160 --> 01:30:25,640
'her blood relatives
when blood was needed.'

1475
01:30:26,520 --> 01:30:27,600
'She called up everyone'

1476
01:30:28,600 --> 01:30:29,960
'but no one replied.'

1477
01:30:39,200 --> 01:30:40,560
We should donate some blood.

1478
01:30:42,040 --> 01:30:42,880
Are you crazy?

1479
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:45,800
When she comes to know,
she will abuse us.

1480
01:30:46,680 --> 01:30:47,520
Forget it.

1481
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:52,560
Yes, we can't compel her
to take our blood.

1482
01:30:57,120 --> 01:30:59,400
I'm feeling a bit hot in here.

1483
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:01,360
I'm stepping out for some air.

1484
01:31:01,480 --> 01:31:02,480
Okay.

1485
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:07,680
Oh! It's a missed call from my wife.

1486
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:09,720
I'll call her and be back, okay?
- Okay.

1487
01:31:11,680 --> 01:31:13,400
Hey! I'll be sleeping right here, okay?

1488
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:15,080
Yes. See you soon, okay?

1489
01:31:18,280 --> 01:31:21,000
Ma'am, a patient named Aarambh Sharma,
is in ICCU room no 3.

1490
01:31:21,120 --> 01:31:22,400
I want to donate blood for him.

1491
01:31:22,520 --> 01:31:23,960
What's your name?
- Abeer Khan.

1492
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:25,080
Abeer.

1493
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:30,240
You had gone out to get some fresh air.

1494
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:31,960
Did the fresh air change your mind?
- I had gone for a stroll.

1495
01:31:32,080 --> 01:31:34,600
Write down my name. - Are you done
talking to your wife already?

1496
01:31:34,680 --> 01:31:36,720
Namit, let me do this good deed.

1497
01:31:37,080 --> 01:31:39,760
Write down my name.
- This is ridiculous.

1498
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:41,640
I came here before both of you.

1499
01:31:41,720 --> 01:31:42,920
I'll donate blood. Go and have a seat.
- Write down my name.

1500
01:31:43,040 --> 01:31:43,880
I'll do it.
- Hey.

1501
01:31:43,960 --> 01:31:44,960
Write down my name.
- Hey.

1502
01:31:45,120 --> 01:31:46,680
You're being overconfident for nothing.

1503
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:48,720
Do you even have blood
in your body to donate?

1504
01:31:48,840 --> 01:31:50,240
It's okay. I'll suck some of yours.

1505
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:51,480
That's all you've done your whole life.
- It's okay.

1506
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:53,040
I'll do it.
- I'll do it.

1507
01:31:53,160 --> 01:31:54,000
Be quiet.

1508
01:31:54,120 --> 01:31:55,240
I was here first.
- I'll do it. End of story.

1509
01:31:55,360 --> 01:31:56,160
I was here before both of you.

1510
01:31:56,280 --> 01:31:57,240
That's the problem with them.
- I'll do it.

1511
01:31:57,360 --> 01:31:58,440
I came before both of them.

1512
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:00,200
I'll give it first.
- I'll donate blood...

1513
01:32:00,280 --> 01:32:01,600
No...
- Silence, please!

1514
01:32:03,120 --> 01:32:04,280
Why are you guys fighting?

1515
01:32:04,680 --> 01:32:05,640
You just have to donate blood.

1516
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:06,640
All three can donate.

1517
01:32:06,920 --> 01:32:07,840
Tell me your names.

1518
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:09,520
Surjo Kumar Pandey.

1519
01:32:11,040 --> 01:32:12,080
Abeer Khan.

1520
01:32:13,240 --> 01:32:14,240
Namit Gupta.

1521
01:32:18,640 --> 01:32:21,000
'We had always seen heroes
donate blood in the movies.'

1522
01:32:21,680 --> 01:32:23,720
'It had always been our desire'

1523
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:25,680
'which finally got fulfilled.'

1524
01:32:26,640 --> 01:32:27,560
'It's rightly said, '

1525
01:32:27,880 --> 01:32:28,840
'when you donate blood,'

1526
01:32:29,120 --> 01:32:30,120
'it feels good!'

1527
01:32:32,120 --> 01:32:35,600
'After donating 400 ml of blood, we felt
as if we had completed a pilgrimage!'

1528
01:32:36,160 --> 01:32:38,520
'The WBC and RBC in our blood
had doubled.'

1529
01:32:39,320 --> 01:32:41,240
'And the platelets urged us'

1530
01:32:41,960 --> 01:32:43,120
'to celebrate!'

1531
01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:47,040
Do you recall something?

1532
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:51,520
How can I forget?

1533
01:32:52,680 --> 01:32:53,600
Guys...

1534
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:55,960
Where have you brought me?

1535
01:32:58,320 --> 01:32:59,840
What about the students who stay here?

1536
01:33:00,720 --> 01:33:01,800
They are out partying.

1537
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:09,080
Since we have donated blood,
we need to produce some more.

1538
01:33:39,080 --> 01:33:42,480
"Listen to me."

1539
01:33:43,160 --> 01:33:46,280
"Come back now."

1540
01:33:47,320 --> 01:33:50,680
"Listen to me."

1541
01:33:51,400 --> 01:33:54,720
"Come back now."

1542
01:33:56,320 --> 01:34:01,360
"Don't be so angry."

1543
01:34:03,240 --> 01:34:08,040
"Forget everything and say something."

1544
01:34:09,120 --> 01:34:13,160
"Don't be so difficult."

1545
01:34:13,440 --> 01:34:17,120
"Come on, don't be so difficult."

1546
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:21,040
"Don't be so difficult."

1547
01:34:21,480 --> 01:34:25,440
"Come on, don't be so difficult."

1548
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:33,120
"I accept that your anger is justified."

1549
01:34:34,080 --> 01:34:41,480
"Now, I accept that
your anger is justified."

1550
01:34:42,040 --> 01:34:45,720
"Don't be so difficult."

1551
01:34:46,200 --> 01:34:51,440
"Come on, don't be so difficult."

1552
01:35:32,240 --> 01:35:35,120
"O beloved."

1553
01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:39,440
"Don't test me, my beloved."

1554
01:35:39,840 --> 01:35:43,960
"You don't care"

1555
01:35:44,280 --> 01:35:47,920
"how I am, O beloved."

1556
01:35:48,040 --> 01:35:52,080
"Why are you silent?
You don't say a word."

1557
01:35:52,400 --> 01:35:56,520
"Don't be so angry."

1558
01:35:56,640 --> 01:36:00,080
"It's not right."

1559
01:36:00,440 --> 01:36:06,760
"I accept that your anger is justified."

1560
01:36:08,400 --> 01:36:15,520
"Now, I accept that
your anger is justified."

1561
01:36:18,600 --> 01:36:19,480
Surjo,

1562
01:36:20,160 --> 01:36:21,760
your capacity has decreased.

1563
01:36:23,280 --> 01:36:24,520
We don't get it in the village.

1564
01:36:25,400 --> 01:36:26,720
My capacity will surely decrease.

1565
01:36:37,240 --> 01:36:38,120
Did you guys think

1566
01:36:38,880 --> 01:36:39,800
I won't come to know?

1567
01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:41,960
Manjari,

1568
01:36:42,560 --> 01:36:45,120
you don't need to thank us.

1569
01:36:46,480 --> 01:36:48,080
Manjari, it's our duty.
- Yes.

1570
01:36:48,200 --> 01:36:49,120
Don't worry.

1571
01:36:49,360 --> 01:36:50,960
I don't care if it was your duty or not.

1572
01:36:51,800 --> 01:36:53,960
Why did the three of you
return after so many years?

1573
01:36:55,480 --> 01:36:56,480
What do you want from me?

1574
01:36:59,120 --> 01:37:00,040
We just

1575
01:37:00,440 --> 01:37:01,560
wanted to help.

1576
01:37:05,080 --> 01:37:06,360
I don't need any help.

1577
01:37:07,440 --> 01:37:09,600
What you did four years ago
was more than enough!

1578
01:37:16,040 --> 01:37:17,200
Please leave.

1579
01:37:17,960 --> 01:37:18,920
We'll leave.

1580
01:37:20,560 --> 01:37:22,480
But give us a chance
to rectify our mistake.

1581
01:37:25,960 --> 01:37:27,480
Let us stay until Aarambh recovers.

1582
01:37:28,720 --> 01:37:29,720
We'll leave after that.

1583
01:37:32,760 --> 01:37:34,120
Do whatever you want.

1584
01:37:35,440 --> 01:37:36,880
But don't expect anything from me.

1585
01:37:40,400 --> 01:37:41,280
Manjari!

1586
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:46,640
You felt hurt, didn't you?

1587
01:37:49,560 --> 01:37:51,120
'Friendship is a strange relationship.'

1588
01:37:52,360 --> 01:37:53,880
'On the one hand someone felt hurt,'

1589
01:37:54,880 --> 01:37:56,800
'on the other hand we were
getting closer.'

1590
01:38:00,040 --> 01:38:01,200
You are wearing a nice shirt.

1591
01:38:07,360 --> 01:38:08,320
It's yours.

1592
01:38:09,600 --> 01:38:10,920
I know that, you scoundrel.

1593
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:22,080
'We weren't the only ones
paying the price of our remorse.'

1594
01:38:22,960 --> 01:38:24,440
'Our families also bore the brunt.'

1595
01:38:28,320 --> 01:38:31,160
'Abeer had no answers
to his family's questions.'

1596
01:38:36,880 --> 01:38:38,080
'As for my family...'

1597
01:38:39,480 --> 01:38:42,120
'I had stopped answering
their questions long back.'

1598
01:39:00,040 --> 01:39:02,320
I'm going out for some work.

1599
01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:06,560
Let me know if you need anything.

1600
01:39:10,320 --> 01:39:11,920
Abeer and Surjo went home.

1601
01:39:14,840 --> 01:39:15,960
They'll be back by tomorrow.

1602
01:39:17,920 --> 01:39:18,960
Why don't you go home?

1603
01:39:23,320 --> 01:39:25,080
Ask him where he was all these days.

1604
01:39:25,200 --> 01:39:26,160
Why don't you ask him?

1605
01:39:26,480 --> 01:39:28,480
I'm telling you to ask him,
but you want me to ask!

1606
01:39:28,600 --> 01:39:30,040
Begin the topic.

1607
01:39:35,560 --> 01:39:37,600
What were you doing there
for all these days?

1608
01:39:38,320 --> 01:39:39,720
Mom, I had some work to do.

1609
01:39:40,040 --> 01:39:42,200
But meeting Noor was more important.

1610
01:39:43,640 --> 01:39:45,080
Mom, you won't understand.

1611
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:47,440
Why don't you explain?

1612
01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:49,400
What kept you so busy?

1613
01:39:51,480 --> 01:39:52,440
Dad,

1614
01:39:54,120 --> 01:39:56,000
my company has transferred me

1615
01:39:56,400 --> 01:39:57,680
to Noida for a few months.

1616
01:40:01,160 --> 01:40:04,560
You still don't know how to lie, do you?

1617
01:40:15,920 --> 01:40:17,600
You came home yesterday.

1618
01:40:17,880 --> 01:40:18,920
Are you leaving again?

1619
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:21,080
I have some work.

1620
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:23,960
Let me come with you.

1621
01:40:24,480 --> 01:40:26,240
No. What will you do there?

1622
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:32,200
When will you be back?

1623
01:40:33,280 --> 01:40:34,920
Why are you asking so many questions?

1624
01:40:36,280 --> 01:40:37,280
Serve me lunch.

1625
01:40:44,520 --> 01:40:47,240
I hope you are not having
an affair in the city.

1626
01:40:53,400 --> 01:40:54,800
Take these clothes for washing.

1627
01:40:56,800 --> 01:40:57,640
Here you are.

1628
01:40:58,800 --> 01:40:59,920
I bought a sari for you.

1629
01:41:01,200 --> 01:41:02,280
Do you like it?

1630
01:41:24,720 --> 01:41:26,000
Manjari is feeling lonely.

1631
01:41:26,800 --> 01:41:27,960
She needs you.

1632
01:41:28,680 --> 01:41:29,560
That's good.

1633
01:41:32,480 --> 01:41:34,400
Now, outsiders will tell me

1634
01:41:35,200 --> 01:41:36,360
what I need to do!

1635
01:41:39,320 --> 01:41:41,440
Who was affected the most

1636
01:41:42,720 --> 01:41:45,040
by Manjari's misdeed in college?

1637
01:41:47,880 --> 01:41:48,800
It was me.

1638
01:41:50,200 --> 01:41:51,760
I lost respect in my neighbourhood

1639
01:41:53,120 --> 01:41:54,120
and in the party.

1640
01:41:57,280 --> 01:41:59,240
It took me four years
to get rid of the stigma.

1641
01:42:02,080 --> 01:42:03,840
Manjari was my sister!

1642
01:42:04,480 --> 01:42:05,520
Understand?

1643
01:42:06,280 --> 01:42:07,120
She was!

1644
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:08,600
How can you do this?

1645
01:42:09,560 --> 01:42:10,960
You are his brother.

1646
01:42:17,480 --> 01:42:18,480
I don't need your advise.

1647
01:42:19,240 --> 01:42:20,360
Get this straight.

1648
01:42:22,240 --> 01:42:23,120
Stay away

1649
01:42:23,720 --> 01:42:24,680
from me,

1650
01:42:25,160 --> 01:42:26,760
from Manjari and from our neighbourhood.

1651
01:42:27,760 --> 01:42:28,880
It will be good for you.

1652
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:31,440
You are an outsider.

1653
01:42:32,280 --> 01:42:33,200
Stay out of this!

1654
01:42:34,720 --> 01:42:36,360
Don't try to be a family member.

1655
01:42:41,320 --> 01:42:43,120
'Aarambh's manager
Mr Srivastava told us'

1656
01:42:43,240 --> 01:42:45,080
'owing to Aarambh's critical condition'

1657
01:42:45,600 --> 01:42:47,320
'clients were cancelling their orders.'

1658
01:42:48,920 --> 01:42:50,880
'On the one hand the hospital
expenses increased.'

1659
01:42:51,960 --> 01:42:54,080
'And on the other hand
there was financial stress.'

1660
01:42:55,800 --> 01:42:57,520
'The surgery would be expensive.'

1661
01:42:58,720 --> 01:43:01,200
'Manjari just didn't know what to do.'

1662
01:43:05,640 --> 01:43:06,480
Listen.

1663
01:43:08,360 --> 01:43:09,720
We can't do much.

1664
01:43:11,200 --> 01:43:13,200
But we can help you a little.

1665
01:43:15,320 --> 01:43:17,720
I won't need to seek your help.

1666
01:43:18,480 --> 01:43:19,560
Don't seek our help.

1667
01:43:20,600 --> 01:43:23,040
But you will have to arrange
for the money somehow.

1668
01:43:24,520 --> 01:43:26,520
I spoke to Mr Srivastava.

1669
01:43:29,440 --> 01:43:31,080
I have a huge house.

1670
01:43:37,800 --> 01:43:39,440
I'm planning to sell the house.

1671
01:43:41,560 --> 01:43:42,880
Are you happy now?

1672
01:43:43,960 --> 01:43:45,240
I have no choice.

1673
01:43:47,160 --> 01:43:50,320
When a girl like you talks
like us losers,

1674
01:43:50,760 --> 01:43:52,080
it doesn't look good.

1675
01:43:54,360 --> 01:43:56,280
Namit, it's easy to lecture someone.

1676
01:43:58,680 --> 01:43:59,920
There's nothing else I can do.

1677
01:44:02,400 --> 01:44:03,360
Take my advise...

1678
01:44:03,480 --> 01:44:05,720
I did listen to the three of you once.

1679
01:44:07,760 --> 01:44:09,600
It shattered all my dreams.

1680
01:44:10,920 --> 01:44:12,080
What else do you have to say?

1681
01:44:12,200 --> 01:44:14,000
There's no point talking to you.

1682
01:44:15,880 --> 01:44:17,320
I want you to be the girl

1683
01:44:17,440 --> 01:44:19,840
who fought with the hospital staff
without batting an eyelid!

1684
01:44:22,200 --> 01:44:24,160
You went anywhere fearlessly

1685
01:44:24,280 --> 01:44:26,120
even in the middle of the night.

1686
01:44:28,680 --> 01:44:30,440
That Manjari never looked pitiful.

1687
01:44:38,920 --> 01:44:39,880
Get up.

1688
01:44:41,880 --> 01:44:43,880
Get up and start handling
Aarambh's business.

1689
01:44:45,920 --> 01:44:47,400
Namit is absolutely right.

1690
01:44:48,080 --> 01:44:49,240
He's absolutely right.

1691
01:44:51,400 --> 01:44:53,280
You will have to handle the business.

1692
01:44:54,360 --> 01:44:56,520
Manjari, get up and handle the business.

1693
01:44:58,240 --> 01:45:01,040
If I handle the business,
who will take care of Aarambh?

1694
01:45:01,320 --> 01:45:02,440
We will.
- Yes.

1695
01:45:04,280 --> 01:45:05,480
We will take care of him.

1696
01:45:15,560 --> 01:45:23,120
"Wherever I bow my head with reverence,"

1697
01:45:25,480 --> 01:45:38,120
"it proves your presence."

1698
01:45:40,240 --> 01:45:51,680
"O Almighty."

1699
01:45:55,760 --> 01:45:59,760
"I want to be yours."

1700
01:46:00,720 --> 01:46:04,840
"I belong to you."

1701
01:46:05,680 --> 01:46:09,840
"I want to be yours."

1702
01:46:10,680 --> 01:46:14,320
"I belong to you."

1703
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:19,720
"I prayed a hundred
times to be with you."

1704
01:46:20,160 --> 01:46:24,760
"You are the fruit of my deeds."

1705
01:46:24,880 --> 01:46:27,240
"Make a decision."

1706
01:46:27,360 --> 01:46:29,720
"Grant me strength."

1707
01:46:29,840 --> 01:46:34,440
"Bestow your benevolence
on me, Almighty."

1708
01:46:34,800 --> 01:46:37,040
"Make a decision."

1709
01:46:37,160 --> 01:46:39,480
"Grant me strength."

1710
01:46:39,760 --> 01:46:44,520
"Bestow your benevolence
on me, Almighty."

1711
01:46:44,880 --> 01:46:47,200
"O, Almighty!"

1712
01:46:47,320 --> 01:46:49,720
"Lord Almighty!"

1713
01:46:49,840 --> 01:46:52,400
"O, Almighty!"

1714
01:46:52,480 --> 01:46:55,000
"Lord Almighty!"

1715
01:47:14,480 --> 01:47:22,800
"Wherever I might be,
you are my world."

1716
01:47:23,240 --> 01:47:27,600
"Guide me with your dreams."

1717
01:47:27,720 --> 01:47:30,720
"You hold my reins."

1718
01:47:30,840 --> 01:47:33,080
"You and Your benevolence"

1719
01:47:33,200 --> 01:47:35,680
"heals my wounds."

1720
01:47:35,800 --> 01:47:38,080
"It's at your temple"

1721
01:47:38,200 --> 01:47:40,320
"that my wounds are healed."

1722
01:47:40,440 --> 01:47:42,800
"Make a decision."

1723
01:47:42,920 --> 01:47:45,280
"Grant me strength."

1724
01:47:45,400 --> 01:47:50,480
"Bestow your benevolence
on me, Almighty."

1725
01:47:53,320 --> 01:47:55,760
'Aarambh's business
was getting back on track.'

1726
01:47:56,760 --> 01:47:58,280
'When the business became profitable,'

1727
01:47:58,840 --> 01:48:01,160
'many of Manjari's problems
were solved.'

1728
01:48:06,400 --> 01:48:08,240
'According to the doctors,
Aarambh's condition'

1729
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:10,240
'was good for the operation.'

1730
01:48:11,960 --> 01:48:13,200
'The operation was successful'

1731
01:48:13,960 --> 01:48:16,640
'and Manjari's life was filled
with happiness again.'

1732
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:54,360
You will be discharged tomorrow.

1733
01:48:55,080 --> 01:48:56,480
Before you are discharged,

1734
01:48:58,040 --> 01:48:59,840
the three of us want to give you
a small gift.

1735
01:49:13,360 --> 01:49:16,800
It will always remind you of us.

1736
01:49:22,720 --> 01:49:23,680
Do you play carom?

1737
01:49:25,280 --> 01:49:26,120
What?

1738
01:49:26,920 --> 01:49:27,920
Carom!

1739
01:49:28,640 --> 01:49:29,960
Do you play carom?

1740
01:49:33,760 --> 01:49:35,080
I have a carom board.

1741
01:49:36,560 --> 01:49:37,720
It's 20 years old.

1742
01:49:39,840 --> 01:49:41,160
But I never made friends

1743
01:49:42,760 --> 01:49:44,840
and I never got the chance
to play carom.

1744
01:49:47,680 --> 01:49:48,640
What do you think?

1745
01:49:50,480 --> 01:49:52,080
Sorry. We didn't get you.

1746
01:49:52,720 --> 01:49:53,560
Yes.

1747
01:49:53,680 --> 01:49:55,880
You looked after me for so many days.

1748
01:49:58,440 --> 01:49:59,280
Give me

1749
01:49:59,880 --> 01:50:01,960
a chance to serve you guys.

1750
01:50:04,880 --> 01:50:06,920
What are you saying?
- You...

1751
01:50:07,200 --> 01:50:08,080
What are you saying?

1752
01:50:08,200 --> 01:50:09,320
Just for a few days.

1753
01:50:09,640 --> 01:50:10,760
For a few days,

1754
01:50:10,880 --> 01:50:13,520
be our guests and stay with us.

1755
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:15,080
No.

1756
01:50:21,200 --> 01:50:22,560
Don't look at Manjari.

1757
01:50:25,200 --> 01:50:27,520
All the lines on this route are busy!

1758
01:50:36,200 --> 01:50:37,240
Fine.

1759
01:50:39,600 --> 01:50:40,640
But only on one condition.

1760
01:50:42,280 --> 01:50:44,040
You may pocket the black
and white pieces.

1761
01:50:47,840 --> 01:50:49,280
But the queen belongs to me!

1762
01:51:01,640 --> 01:51:02,520
I was joking.

1763
01:51:02,640 --> 01:51:04,480
Don't take it seriously.

1764
01:51:32,480 --> 01:51:33,320
Hey!

1765
01:52:07,600 --> 01:52:08,480
Namit,

1766
01:52:08,720 --> 01:52:10,280
so what if you couldn't
become a doctor?

1767
01:52:10,480 --> 01:52:11,680
You can become a good chef!

1768
01:52:13,680 --> 01:52:14,720
Let me tell you something.

1769
01:52:15,120 --> 01:52:16,720
It's very difficult to make 'rasgullas'.

1770
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:18,920
But eating them...

1771
01:52:19,040 --> 01:52:20,080
If you...

1772
01:52:20,200 --> 01:52:21,160
Surjo!

1773
01:52:21,960 --> 01:52:23,040
Surjo!
- Abeer!

1774
01:52:23,160 --> 01:52:24,080
Abeer, here you are.

1775
01:52:24,360 --> 01:52:25,720
Okay, dad.
- It's for dinner.

1776
01:52:26,520 --> 01:52:28,360
No, dad. We aren't partying.

1777
01:52:28,680 --> 01:52:29,720
It is Manjari's birthday.

1778
01:52:29,840 --> 01:52:31,480
So, I planned a small function.

1779
01:52:31,920 --> 01:52:33,760
And I will get to meet all of you.

1780
01:52:35,240 --> 01:52:36,320
Mr Srivastava,

1781
01:52:36,760 --> 01:52:39,480
is the consignment that was to
be delivered to Noida ready?

1782
01:52:39,960 --> 01:52:42,080
Yes. The consignment will
be sent in 10 to 15 minutes.

1783
01:52:42,160 --> 01:52:43,560
Okay. I'll go with the consignment.

1784
01:52:43,880 --> 01:52:45,920
It's the first delivery
after I joined here.

1785
01:52:46,120 --> 01:52:47,400
I want to deliver it personally.

1786
01:52:48,240 --> 01:52:49,560
If you are going to Noida,

1787
01:52:50,800 --> 01:52:52,520
set up a meeting with the buyer

1788
01:52:54,760 --> 01:52:56,000
for the new order.

1789
01:52:56,680 --> 01:52:57,640
Sure.

1790
01:54:55,240 --> 01:54:58,440
Abeer, my house wasn't decorated
so well even during my wedding.

1791
01:54:58,840 --> 01:55:01,840
If you had invited me,
I would have decorated it nicely.

1792
01:55:09,840 --> 01:55:10,720
Stop it!

1793
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:14,840
Why are you creating
a commotion for no reason?

1794
01:55:15,840 --> 01:55:16,720
Manjari!

1795
01:55:17,440 --> 01:55:18,720
It was my idea.

1796
01:55:19,560 --> 01:55:21,920
I haven't invited many people.
It'll just be family members.

1797
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:22,960
Why did you invite them?

1798
01:55:23,240 --> 01:55:24,320
Tell them not to come here.

1799
01:55:25,760 --> 01:55:26,840
Manjari, what's the matter?

1800
01:55:27,880 --> 01:55:28,840
Why are you doing this?

1801
01:55:29,360 --> 01:55:30,520
That's what I'd like to know.

1802
01:55:31,200 --> 01:55:32,080
What's all this?

1803
01:55:32,600 --> 01:55:33,480
Why did you do it?

1804
01:55:33,760 --> 01:55:35,000
It's your birthday, so we...

1805
01:55:35,120 --> 01:55:35,960
Who did you ask?

1806
01:55:37,480 --> 01:55:39,520
Who gave you the permission
to place that order?

1807
01:55:44,040 --> 01:55:45,120
It's your birthday.

1808
01:55:46,440 --> 01:55:48,120
We will talk about it tomorrow. Okay?

1809
01:55:50,240 --> 01:55:51,880
He got us an order worth Rs 1 million.

1810
01:55:54,960 --> 01:55:55,840
On the one hand,

1811
01:55:56,400 --> 01:55:58,040
you kept encouraging me.

1812
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:00,760
On the other hand,
you kept doing me favours.

1813
01:56:01,280 --> 01:56:02,360
Why? Did you think

1814
01:56:02,920 --> 01:56:04,840
I won't be able to handle a business?

1815
01:56:05,640 --> 01:56:06,560
Is it?

1816
01:56:07,440 --> 01:56:09,800
Manjari, forget it.

1817
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:11,320
You would have got an order
from someone or the other.

1818
01:56:11,480 --> 01:56:13,480
It's no big deal if Namit
got you an order!

1819
01:56:13,960 --> 01:56:16,040
He did all that without informing me.

1820
01:56:16,360 --> 01:56:17,200
Why?

1821
01:56:17,760 --> 01:56:18,840
Why?

1822
01:56:20,440 --> 01:56:22,160
He did it for your welfare.

1823
01:56:24,840 --> 01:56:26,400
Manjari, why are you
creating a scene unnecessarily?

1824
01:56:26,680 --> 01:56:27,640
Am I creating a scene?

1825
01:56:28,040 --> 01:56:29,640
You guys are putting up an act here!

1826
01:56:30,120 --> 01:56:31,760
You think we are putting up an act.

1827
01:56:32,320 --> 01:56:35,000
Manjari, you sent us a message
and asked us to come to the hospital.

1828
01:56:35,120 --> 01:56:36,200
Tell us if you have

1829
01:56:36,320 --> 01:56:38,800
ever talked to us politely
since that day.

1830
01:56:39,240 --> 01:56:41,800
I am telling you for the last time,
I didn't call anyone.

1831
01:56:42,880 --> 01:56:45,080
Well then, you tell us
who called us here.

1832
01:56:47,080 --> 01:56:48,080
Ask your friend.

1833
01:56:48,960 --> 01:56:49,880
Ask him.

1834
01:56:57,080 --> 01:56:58,000
'Was it a coincidence?'

1835
01:56:58,200 --> 01:57:00,280
'Or was it fate at play?'

1836
01:57:01,360 --> 01:57:03,720
'Aarambh met with an accident
near my hospital.'

1837
01:57:06,080 --> 01:57:07,880
'Because of a serious head injury,'

1838
01:57:08,480 --> 01:57:09,480
'my dad suggested'

1839
01:57:09,600 --> 01:57:12,120
'we should move Aarambh to the
medical college at the earliest.'

1840
01:57:13,240 --> 01:57:15,240
'I had never imagined that
I'd get to meet Manjari'

1841
01:57:15,320 --> 01:57:17,080
'under these circumstances
after four years.'

1842
01:57:48,760 --> 01:57:50,840
'I tried to face her.'

1843
01:57:50,960 --> 01:57:52,680
'But I just couldn't muster
the courage.'

1844
01:58:04,960 --> 01:58:06,800
'I was not able to do it
on my own.'

1845
01:58:07,920 --> 01:58:10,040
'Hence, I had to request
someone else.'

1846
01:58:26,200 --> 01:58:27,040
I am sorry.

1847
01:58:29,280 --> 01:58:30,440
I sent that message.

1848
01:58:32,560 --> 01:58:33,720
Manjari, I want you to

1849
01:58:34,680 --> 01:58:36,640
give him a tight slap once again!

1850
01:58:36,760 --> 01:58:38,320
Stop talking nonsense.
- No, Abeer.

1851
01:58:40,320 --> 01:58:41,480
People go to any extent

1852
01:58:42,240 --> 01:58:43,440
for their friends.

1853
01:58:46,760 --> 01:58:48,440
But they fail to maintain
their friendship.

1854
01:58:50,800 --> 01:58:52,120
This guy is crazy.

1855
01:58:54,040 --> 01:58:55,280
You are such an idiot.

1856
01:58:56,560 --> 01:58:57,520
Aren't you?

1857
01:58:58,120 --> 01:58:59,400
You did all that

1858
01:59:01,440 --> 01:59:02,360
without telling us.

1859
01:59:04,200 --> 01:59:05,480
You never let us know.

1860
01:59:12,520 --> 01:59:13,960
I don't get it.

1861
01:59:16,400 --> 01:59:17,440
I have got an idea.

1862
01:59:28,160 --> 01:59:29,760
Has the suspense ended now?

1863
01:59:31,600 --> 01:59:32,960
Your friends are back together.

1864
01:59:34,840 --> 01:59:36,080
Nobody holds a grudge anymore.

1865
01:59:36,200 --> 01:59:37,080
No.

1866
01:59:37,680 --> 01:59:38,960
The matter is not closed yet.

1867
01:59:39,240 --> 01:59:40,800
What is it, Manjari?

1868
01:59:41,640 --> 01:59:42,720
An order worth Rs 1 million.

1869
01:59:43,680 --> 01:59:44,720
Inviting everyone here.

1870
01:59:45,800 --> 01:59:46,800
Why did you do all this?

1871
01:59:46,920 --> 01:59:47,760
Manjari.

1872
01:59:48,080 --> 01:59:49,720
Do you really want to know?
- Yes, I do!

1873
01:59:50,760 --> 01:59:51,880
Why are you making it worse?

1874
01:59:51,960 --> 01:59:53,320
I am not making anything worse.

1875
01:59:53,520 --> 01:59:54,480
I am ending it.

1876
01:59:54,760 --> 01:59:56,720
And I am ending it
because he has evil intentions.

1877
01:59:57,080 --> 01:59:58,160
He hasn't come clean.

1878
02:00:05,920 --> 02:00:06,840
Evil intentions!

1879
02:00:11,280 --> 02:00:14,520
If you think I have evil intentions,

1880
02:00:16,120 --> 02:00:17,080
you are right.

1881
02:00:18,840 --> 02:00:19,720
I do...

1882
02:00:21,320 --> 02:00:22,680
I do have evil intentions for you.

1883
02:00:25,640 --> 02:00:26,600
If it's a mistake

1884
02:00:27,760 --> 02:00:28,960
to love you,

1885
02:00:31,120 --> 02:00:32,120
then I've made a mistake.

1886
02:00:35,080 --> 02:00:37,800
But I didn't want to express
my feelings to anyone.

1887
02:00:38,640 --> 02:00:40,560
And I didn't want to let
anyone to know either.

1888
02:00:44,240 --> 02:00:45,640
Whatever I did

1889
02:00:46,160 --> 02:00:47,160
was not just out of love.

1890
02:00:48,600 --> 02:00:49,720
I did it as a friend.

1891
02:00:52,440 --> 02:00:53,800
But I don't understand

1892
02:00:54,120 --> 02:00:56,960
when I cross my limits as a friend.

1893
02:01:00,800 --> 02:01:02,280
Love doesn't have

1894
02:01:02,720 --> 02:01:04,280
a play and pause button.

1895
02:01:06,040 --> 02:01:07,400
The heart does as it pleases,

1896
02:01:08,120 --> 02:01:09,680
no matter how illogical it seems.

1897
02:01:14,920 --> 02:01:15,800
I am sorry.

1898
02:01:18,240 --> 02:01:19,560
I am sorry, Manjari, but...

1899
02:01:21,320 --> 02:01:22,280
Sometimes,

1900
02:01:23,240 --> 02:01:24,760
when you make a heartfelt decision,

1901
02:01:25,480 --> 02:01:27,280
it doesn't matter
whether it's right or wrong.

1902
02:01:31,720 --> 02:01:32,920
It's not like

1903
02:01:33,920 --> 02:01:35,360
I didn't try to control my feelings.

1904
02:01:42,240 --> 02:01:43,200
I tried a lot.

1905
02:01:55,120 --> 02:01:56,120
But...

1906
02:01:59,480 --> 02:02:00,760
I can't.

1907
02:02:03,880 --> 02:02:04,760
I am sorry.

1908
02:02:14,280 --> 02:02:15,200
Manjari.

1909
02:02:22,320 --> 02:02:23,240
Manjari.

1910
02:02:33,240 --> 02:02:34,160
You have to decide.

1911
02:02:36,440 --> 02:02:37,800
Who are you mad at?

1912
02:02:39,160 --> 02:02:39,960
Namit?

1913
02:02:42,400 --> 02:02:43,280
Your friends?

1914
02:02:46,480 --> 02:02:47,520
Or yourself?

1915
02:02:53,400 --> 02:02:54,480
Manjari, my child!

1916
02:02:57,240 --> 02:02:58,080
Manjari...

1917
02:03:00,640 --> 02:03:01,880
What are you guys doing here?

1918
02:03:02,960 --> 02:03:03,880
We told you

1919
02:03:04,160 --> 02:03:06,560
to stay away from Manjari,
from us and this neighbourhood!

1920
02:03:15,080 --> 02:03:15,960
This is my house.

1921
02:03:27,120 --> 02:03:28,640
And they are my friends.

1922
02:03:30,080 --> 02:03:31,800
And we are your relatives.

1923
02:03:33,040 --> 02:03:34,600
We didn't come here on our own.

1924
02:03:35,120 --> 02:03:36,640
We are here since you invited us.

1925
02:03:38,120 --> 02:03:39,200
That's why I am saying

1926
02:03:39,800 --> 02:03:41,840
there's no point fighting
over these petty issues.

1927
02:03:44,280 --> 02:03:45,160
Come on,

1928
02:03:45,480 --> 02:03:46,440
please come inside.

1929
02:03:46,960 --> 02:03:48,680
We will enter your house

1930
02:03:49,680 --> 02:03:52,480
only after these three idiots leave.

1931
02:03:53,920 --> 02:03:56,880
'I told these rascals that they are
outsiders and should stay out of this.'

1932
02:03:57,200 --> 02:03:58,920
'They got away four years ago.'

1933
02:03:59,040 --> 02:04:00,120
'But let me see'

1934
02:04:00,240 --> 02:04:02,520
'who saves the three of you today.'

1935
02:04:11,440 --> 02:04:12,880
A crowd has gathered outside.

1936
02:04:14,680 --> 02:04:15,880
Let's not create a scene.

1937
02:04:16,360 --> 02:04:17,320
Father, please.

1938
02:04:17,800 --> 02:04:18,760
Talk to him.

1939
02:04:18,960 --> 02:04:19,920
Wow!

1940
02:04:20,760 --> 02:04:21,760
That's great.

1941
02:04:24,560 --> 02:04:25,520
Fantastic!

1942
02:04:26,400 --> 02:04:27,760
You are hand in gloves with them.

1943
02:04:28,560 --> 02:04:29,640
Right?

1944
02:04:32,720 --> 02:04:35,720
It won't be easy
to make you guys leave.

1945
02:04:37,480 --> 02:04:38,800
I will have to throw you out.

1946
02:04:39,320 --> 02:04:40,400
No problem.

1947
02:04:41,440 --> 02:04:43,040
If you don't listen to me,

1948
02:04:44,040 --> 02:04:45,280
I will beat you up to a pulp.

1949
02:04:46,160 --> 02:04:47,240
So, tell me, guys.

1950
02:04:47,920 --> 02:04:48,840
Tell me.

1951
02:04:49,560 --> 02:04:50,640
Will you leave on your own,

1952
02:04:51,040 --> 02:04:52,520
or should I throw you out?

1953
02:04:53,080 --> 02:04:54,040
Stop!

1954
02:05:02,960 --> 02:05:04,640
We won't let outsiders decide

1955
02:05:04,760 --> 02:05:06,360
who will stay in our house
and who won't!

1956
02:05:10,360 --> 02:05:11,280
Outsiders!

1957
02:05:12,640 --> 02:05:14,080
These three are outsiders.

1958
02:05:16,200 --> 02:05:18,080
And today, I will throw these three

1959
02:05:18,200 --> 02:05:21,160
out of the house
and our neighbourhood forever.

1960
02:05:21,520 --> 02:05:22,840
They are not going anywhere.

1961
02:05:26,080 --> 02:05:27,000
Listen, Manjari.

1962
02:05:27,960 --> 02:05:30,360
If you want your family
to enter your house,

1963
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:32,240
get these three to leave.

1964
02:05:33,760 --> 02:05:35,440
Those who want to come in
are free to do so

1965
02:05:35,560 --> 02:05:37,080
and those who want to leave may leave.

1966
02:05:37,160 --> 02:05:38,560
But these three won't go anywhere.

1967
02:05:39,600 --> 02:05:42,360
Your life got ruined because of them.

1968
02:05:44,080 --> 02:05:45,320
You couldn't become a doctor.

1969
02:05:46,520 --> 02:05:47,400
And today...

1970
02:05:47,760 --> 02:05:48,960
Today, you are defending them!

1971
02:05:50,080 --> 02:05:51,080
These louts!

1972
02:05:51,200 --> 02:05:52,840
They aren't louts!

1973
02:05:55,760 --> 02:05:57,280
How can you call them louts?

1974
02:06:00,240 --> 02:06:02,360
When you didn't have time for me,

1975
02:06:03,280 --> 02:06:06,000
they were with me for an entire month.

1976
02:06:06,120 --> 02:06:07,600
How can they be louts?

1977
02:06:12,320 --> 02:06:14,240
While you were sleeping peacefully,

1978
02:06:15,400 --> 02:06:18,200
they stayed up all night long for me.

1979
02:06:18,720 --> 02:06:20,280
How can they be louts?

1980
02:06:23,600 --> 02:06:26,280
You didn't help me
despite being my family.

1981
02:06:27,120 --> 02:06:28,840
But these people forgot their families

1982
02:06:29,120 --> 02:06:30,440
and kept helping me.

1983
02:06:30,560 --> 02:06:32,160
How can they be louts?

1984
02:06:35,280 --> 02:06:36,880
They aren't loafers.

1985
02:06:37,360 --> 02:06:38,520
They are my friends.

1986
02:06:38,840 --> 02:06:39,760
My friends.

1987
02:06:48,480 --> 02:06:49,920
I was your daughter,

1988
02:06:50,360 --> 02:06:51,840
not a liability.

1989
02:06:52,600 --> 02:06:54,200
I couldn't become a doctor.

1990
02:06:55,840 --> 02:07:00,000
It was your fault more than any of us.

1991
02:07:01,440 --> 02:07:03,080
You didn't even console me once.

1992
02:07:03,560 --> 02:07:05,560
You didn't tell me to forget the past

1993
02:07:05,680 --> 02:07:06,720
and move on.

1994
02:07:08,480 --> 02:07:10,200
You made me discontinue my studies.

1995
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:26,800
I apologise to you on their behalf.

1996
02:07:29,240 --> 02:07:30,320
I am sorry.

1997
02:07:32,400 --> 02:07:34,200
Please forgive them if possible.

1998
02:07:36,120 --> 02:07:37,840
I am sorry too.

1999
02:07:41,280 --> 02:07:43,720
I said things I shouldn't have
in a fit of rage.

2000
02:07:46,160 --> 02:07:48,640
To be honest, I was angry with myself.

2001
02:07:50,920 --> 02:07:53,320
And I kept venting my anger on you guys.

2002
02:07:56,080 --> 02:07:58,920
Perhaps because you are my family.

2003
02:08:03,880 --> 02:08:05,200
I do have the right, don't I?

2004
02:08:09,640 --> 02:08:11,000
Because you...

2005
02:08:12,040 --> 02:08:13,480
You aren't my friends.

2006
02:08:14,200 --> 02:08:15,440
You are my family.

2007
02:08:47,880 --> 02:08:49,000
We have made 'rasgullas'.

2008
02:08:52,280 --> 02:08:54,120
Will you have them
before or after dinner?

2009
02:08:56,160 --> 02:08:56,960
Well,

2010
02:08:57,720 --> 02:08:59,080
we must have sweets today.

2011
02:09:00,760 --> 02:09:01,720
Didn't I say

2012
02:09:02,560 --> 02:09:03,840
I wouldn't let anything ruin it?

2013
02:09:10,800 --> 02:09:13,840
Mom must have told you about me.

2014
02:09:14,720 --> 02:09:15,600
What do you do?

2015
02:09:16,240 --> 02:09:17,200
I have done my MA.

2016
02:09:17,520 --> 02:09:19,720
I plan to get a doctorate
and become a professor.

2017
02:09:19,840 --> 02:09:21,600
I see.
- What's your plan?

2018
02:09:22,920 --> 02:09:23,960
I don't have any plan.

2019
02:09:24,360 --> 02:09:25,560
I got expelled from college.

2020
02:09:25,800 --> 02:09:26,840
Oh no!

2021
02:09:27,960 --> 02:09:29,200
You don't have to be so honest.

2022
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:31,240
Okay.
- Let's do it again.

2023
02:09:33,880 --> 02:09:35,280
What's your plan?

2024
02:09:37,120 --> 02:09:37,960
Doctor.

2025
02:09:38,160 --> 02:09:39,200
I want to become a doctor.

2026
02:09:39,280 --> 02:09:40,240
That's a big lie!

2027
02:09:40,560 --> 02:09:41,640
You are unbelievable!

2028
02:09:42,320 --> 02:09:43,960
You tell me not to be honest.

2029
02:09:44,080 --> 02:09:46,320
You don't even want me to lie!
What should I say then?

2030
02:09:46,960 --> 02:09:48,240
Say what you are.

2031
02:09:48,800 --> 02:09:49,800
What am I?

2032
02:09:50,160 --> 02:09:52,160
You are the best partner
a girl can have.

2033
02:09:54,120 --> 02:09:55,240
Let's take it from the top.

2034
02:09:56,440 --> 02:09:57,480
Hi. I am Noor.

2035
02:09:59,120 --> 02:10:00,400
Hi. I am Abeer.

2036
02:10:01,640 --> 02:10:02,600
And I am the best.

2037
02:10:12,440 --> 02:10:13,600
Who makes better tea?

2038
02:10:15,120 --> 02:10:16,200
Is it you or your wife?

2039
02:10:17,320 --> 02:10:18,240
She

2040
02:10:18,960 --> 02:10:20,200
makes delicious tea.

2041
02:10:22,440 --> 02:10:23,640
And she is a great cook.

2042
02:10:27,280 --> 02:10:28,400
In the past few days,

2043
02:10:30,360 --> 02:10:31,720
I missed her a lot.

2044
02:10:32,960 --> 02:10:34,760
If you missed her, did you call her?

2045
02:10:47,200 --> 02:10:48,080
Hello.

2046
02:10:49,160 --> 02:10:50,440
I miss you a lot.

2047
02:10:53,120 --> 02:10:54,160
Really?

2048
02:10:55,520 --> 02:10:57,040
Can I say something?

2049
02:10:57,960 --> 02:10:59,080
Go on.

2050
02:11:00,320 --> 02:11:01,160
I love you.

2051
02:11:03,480 --> 02:11:04,880
Won't you say anything?

2052
02:11:08,800 --> 02:11:10,160
I love you too.

2053
02:11:28,840 --> 02:11:30,880
I have never given anyone a gift.

2054
02:11:31,840 --> 02:11:33,560
If you don't like it...

2055
02:11:35,200 --> 02:11:36,760
Every watch looks good on me.

2056
02:11:42,280 --> 02:11:44,040
Maybe this watch will remind you

2057
02:11:45,520 --> 02:11:47,120
that you need to let bygones be bygones.

2058
02:11:47,600 --> 02:11:49,240
It's time to move on.

2059
02:12:01,920 --> 02:12:02,920
You are quite stubborn.

2060
02:12:20,680 --> 02:12:26,680
"I cannot imagine my life
without you."

2061
02:12:26,800 --> 02:12:32,760
"Your mere thought
fills my heart with joy."

2062
02:12:33,160 --> 02:12:36,080
"This is a new beginning."

2063
02:12:36,200 --> 02:12:41,840
"Let's rekindle our friendship."

2064
02:12:42,040 --> 02:12:43,080
Keep visiting.

2065
02:12:43,200 --> 02:12:49,160
"You are my confidant."

2066
02:12:49,880 --> 02:12:51,440
"You are my confidant."

2067
02:12:51,560 --> 02:12:52,560
'We will keep visiting.'

2068
02:12:52,960 --> 02:12:54,600
'We will keep visiting the lanes'

2069
02:12:54,880 --> 02:12:56,640
'that remind us of our friendship.'

2070
02:12:57,200 --> 02:13:00,240
'We will keep reliving the memories
that we made together.'

2071
02:13:00,680 --> 02:13:03,680
'We will keep meeting
to resolve all our differences.'

2072
02:13:04,960 --> 02:13:06,800
'We will keep visiting those friends'

2073
02:13:07,160 --> 02:13:10,400
'who have been our companions
and partners in crime.'

2074
02:13:11,560 --> 02:13:13,920
'Together, we have lived life
to the fullest.'

2075
02:13:15,920 --> 02:13:17,320
'If we look back,'

2076
02:13:18,800 --> 02:13:20,720
'we will find our friends waiting.'

2077
02:13:21,640 --> 02:13:22,560
'Our friendship'

2078
02:13:23,400 --> 02:13:24,440
'is going strong.'

2079
02:13:26,800 --> 02:13:29,240
'Once again, we have got busy
with our lives.'

2080
02:13:29,920 --> 02:13:32,600
'But we keep updating each other
about our lives.'

2081
02:13:33,440 --> 02:13:35,520
'Surjo has become the village head.'

2082
02:13:36,120 --> 02:13:37,720
'And Abeer has chosen a girl.'

2083
02:13:38,760 --> 02:13:41,840
'Manjari has once again
decided to become a doctor.'

2084
02:13:43,240 --> 02:13:44,240
'As for me,'

2085
02:13:45,080 --> 02:13:47,560
'I have changed
my perspective on life.'

2086
02:13:48,040 --> 02:13:49,600
'I have started afresh.'

2087
02:13:51,040 --> 02:13:52,560
'I aspire to become a writer.'

2088
02:13:53,760 --> 02:13:54,880
'I am writing a book.'

2089
02:13:56,360 --> 02:13:57,960
'I haven't thought about the title yet.'

2090
02:13:58,720 --> 02:14:00,120
'Your suggestions are welcome.'

2091
02:14:01,520 --> 02:14:02,960
'I have narrated the story to you.'

2092
02:14:04,760 --> 02:14:05,920
'Did you like it?'

2093
02:14:06,240 --> 02:14:09,200
"Life is filled with joy
when we are together."

2094
02:14:09,320 --> 02:14:14,960
"We don't care about the world."

2095
02:14:15,440 --> 02:14:21,280
"You are my confidant."

2096
02:14:21,960 --> 02:14:27,440
"You are my confidant."

2097
02:14:27,640 --> 02:14:34,120
"You are my confidant."

2098
02:14:34,240 --> 02:14:40,920
"You are my confidant."

2099
02:15:04,920 --> 02:15:07,880
"May we always be together."

2100
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,800
"May we walk together always."

2101
02:15:17,160 --> 02:15:20,160
"May we always be together."

2102
02:15:20,280 --> 02:15:23,240
"May we walk together always."

2103
02:15:23,360 --> 02:15:26,240
"As long as we shall live,"

2104
02:15:26,360 --> 02:15:31,960
"our friendship won't end."

2105
02:15:32,240 --> 02:15:35,200
"This is a bond of happiness."

2106
02:15:35,320 --> 02:15:41,280
"Friendship is beautiful."

2107
02:15:41,840 --> 02:15:47,560
"You are my confidant."

2108
02:15:47,960 --> 02:15:53,160
"You are my confidant."

2109
02:15:54,080 --> 02:16:00,080
"You are my confidant."

2110
02:16:00,320 --> 02:16:07,400
"You are my confidant."
