1
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:55,120
Hello. - Hello.

2
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:58,620
Hello. - Hello.

3
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:04,120
Hello. - Hello.

4
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,750
I told you not to kill him.

5
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,120
He's still alive.

6
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,330
Look.

7
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:57,790
Chocolate.

8
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,040
Grade four semtex.

9
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,580
That one alone is enough
to blow up this factory.

10
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:15,160
And he's carrying six of them.

11
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:19,870
If I don't speak
up you will kill me.

12
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,160
And what if I do?

13
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,950
You want a medal.

14
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,750
Son of a witch.

15
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:33,080
Some money and safe
passage to the border.

16
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:36,830
I can tell you a lot, sir.

17
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,830
There's an
electrician working outside...

18
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,830
...he is also a RAW agent.

19
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:42,660
Where are you taking me?
- Come on.

20
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:43,660
What...
- Come on.

21
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:44,500
Sir, why have they brought me
here?

22
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,250
What is your name? - Najeeb
Khan.
From Liaquat Bazaar, Quetta.

23
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,040
What's wrong, sir?

24
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,040
I've been working here for the
past three months as a welder.

25
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,330
What is wrong, sir?

26
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:52,290
What is wrong?

27
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:53,450
Major Rajan Sinha.

28
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,870
1 Bihar Regiment.

29
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:57,580
Take off his shirt,
and look for yourself.

30
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,290
Two bullet wounds on
the left shoulder.

31
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:00,870
Come here.

32
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:05,500
He's the guy who shot
Usman Gul in POK last year.

33
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,200
Come on.

34
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,620
Take him away.

35
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:18,950
Another RAW agent is
active in this area.

36
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:22,700
Will you untie my hands, please?

37
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,040
Shall I strangle you?

38
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:27,580
Your name please?

39
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:31,120
One of your guards...

40
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,870
He gave me all the
dope about this place.

41
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:34,160
My guard?

42
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,410
Who?

43
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:40,120
Real name is Mahendra Sandhu.

44
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,370
Cover name... Abdul... Abbas...

45
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:44,700
I don't remember.

46
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,620
Which one?

47
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:04,750
$50,000 and safe passage
to the border. - Done.

48
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,330
Which one?

49
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,830
The fifth guy.

50
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,790
What is your name?
- Ismail Yusuf Bashar.

51
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:17,620
Your full name.

52
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,620
Ismail Yusuf Bashar.

53
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:20,700
Take off his pants.

54
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:24,620
You'll find two Bullet wounds
on the bum. Got it in Kargil.

55
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,330
What are you doing?

56
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:34,000
Who Mahendra Sandhu? I am
Ismail Yusuf Bashar. He's lying.

57
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,750
He's lying, Colonel.

58
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,450
Leave me.

59
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,370
Lower your weapons. Down.

60
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,540
Put your magazines in this, now.

61
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,620
Now move.

62
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Move.

63
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,750
Lock it.

64
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:07,410
Open it.

65
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,410
Only Rashid knew the code.

66
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,040
Take a guess.

67
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,160
Lucky guess.

68
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,040
If I survive I'll
give you a slow death.

69
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,410
Every dog has his day.

70
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:33,290
Where is my partner?

71
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,120
What if Huzefa had killed me?

72
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,370
They'd have given you a medal.

73
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:11,160
...and your wife a petrol pump.

74
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:33,540
Any last wish.

75
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,910
Yes, I want to kick your behind.

76
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:11,120
Send a unit to
factory no.10. Immediately.

77
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:57,910
Start the car.

78
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,370
"There's word on the streets."

79
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:27,160
"There's a guy in the city."

80
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:37,120
"Forget the barricades."

81
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,040
"He has sneaked in."

82
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:50,290
"Things that are impossible to
do."

83
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:53,750
"He's here to make them
possible."

84
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:57,040
"He can turn night into day."

85
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,330
"So what's his name?"

86
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:01,660
"What is it?"

87
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:18,410
"He's here to turn
the tables on you."

88
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:24,910
Stop the car.

89
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:26,080
Let me get down.

90
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:32,330
"He's here to take on
countless enemies alone."

91
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:41,910
"He always does his duty."

92
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:45,120
"As a responsibility."

93
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,660
"He can turn night into day."

94
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:51,040
"So what's his name?"

95
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,160
"What is it?"

96
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:55,830
Peshawar.

97
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,160
I hope you enjoyed the flight.

98
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:05,620
Thank you.

99
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:06,950
My name is Farah Feqqesh.

100
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:08,830
What's your name?

101
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,950
"Call him Govind."

102
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:16,500
"Call him Gopal. Call him
anything.
Call him Hari."

103
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,750
"Call him Govind."

104
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:23,370
"Call him Gopal. As long as
he's there, nothing to worry."

105
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:26,700
"Call him Govind."

106
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:30,200
"Call him Gopal. Call him
anything.
Call him Hari."

107
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:33,660
"Call him Govind."

108
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:37,200
"Call him Gopal. As long as
he's there, nothing to worry."

109
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:07,700
"Call him Govind."

110
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:11,290
"Call him Gopal. Call him
anything.
Call him Hari."

111
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:14,450
"Call him Govind."

112
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:18,080
"Call him Gopal. As long as
he's there, nothing to worry."

113
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:21,580
"Call him Govind."

114
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:25,000
"Call him Gopal. Call him
anything.
Call him Hari."

115
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,450
"Call him Govind."

116
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:31,870
"Call him Gopal. As long as
he's there, nothing to worry."

117
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:35,290
"Call him Govind."

118
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:38,660
"Call him Gopal. Call him
anything.
Call him Hari."

119
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:42,250
"Call him Govind."

120
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:46,000
"Call him Gopal. As long as
he's there, nothing to worry."

121
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:13,000
Arms dealer found dead in
a graveyard outside Moscow.

122
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,330
The murder of Russian arms
dealer Andre Sukhorov...

123
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:21,580
...has again thrown up
this dangerous question.

124
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:24,660
Did Sukhorov possess a
suitcase nuclear bomb?

125
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:27,620
And if so, where is it?

126
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:29,830
Both the United
States and Soviet Union...

127
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:32,120
...have acknowledged
producing nuclear weapons...

128
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,870
...small enough to be carried
in
specially designed backpacks...

129
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:38,120
...during the cold-war.

130
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,500
These bombs, identified
in Russia as KV series...

131
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,790
...have the
explosive power between...

132
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:42,750
...two and six kiloton of TNT.

133
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:45,660
The bombs at
Hiroshima and Nagasaki...

134
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:48,160
...were 16-21 kiloton each.

135
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,450
But the value of the
suitcase bomb lies...

136
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:52,700
...in its ability to be
easily smuggled across
borders...

137
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:55,080
...transported by
means widely available.

138
00:17:55,080 --> 00:18:00,620
And placed as close to
the target as possible.

139
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:03,910
A single suitcase
bomb can devastate...

140
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:06,830
...ten kilometers of a modern
city.

141
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:09,830
It will kill everything
within a three kilometer
radius...

142
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:13,120
...and the radiation
will subsequently kill more.

143
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:17,160
Gentlemen Sukhorov is dead

144
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:20,330
I've heard the bomb is up for
sale

145
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:23,910
This is what every terror
group in the world is looking
for.

146
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,040
This could start World War 3.

147
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:31,000
If this gets into the wrong
hands,
millions will be killed.

148
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:36,080
I was thinking billions.

149
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:52,870
Comrades!

150
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,700
It's my friend Dmitri's
birthday.

151
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,700
So we all have a drink, okay.

152
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:00,580
Make drink.

153
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:47,870
You wanted to meet
in a public place.

154
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:52,330
Abu Nazir has turned a
public place, private.

155
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:53,950
I am impressed.

156
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:56,200
I've chosen the right man.

157
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:14,290
I need $50 million cash
in three days, in Morocco.

158
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,580
So much in so little time.

159
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:22,910
Do you know my commission?

160
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:24,830
Do you know what I need it for?

161
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:31,200
India?

162
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:40,500
I need the money in
three days in Morocco.

163
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,700
Do you have a
contact who can be trusted?

164
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:49,200
I know the right man for the
job.

165
00:20:56,910 --> 00:21:00,250
I will give you $50
million cash, tomorrow.

166
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:02,830
All he has to do is buy 242.

167
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,700
242?

168
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:13,950
Abu, before talking about 242...

169
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:18,870
...can you tell me how many
calories
there are in one potato chip?

170
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:21,660
20.

171
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:25,790
And how many chips
did you eat just now?

172
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,120
I am sorry, I am a health freak.

173
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:34,660
And this can be...
dangerous for your health.

174
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:48,540
Comrades.

175
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,250
Come. We take drink.

176
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:55,250
Bring champagne.

177
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:05,620
This is Colonel.

178
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:07,950
My partner and friend.
- Hi.

179
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,700
Five man army. - Yes.

180
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:11,290
When I was a child...

181
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:13,580
...I watched a movie
called 'The Five Man Army'.

182
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:16,790
Your boss Abu,
reminds me of Bud Spencer.

183
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,200
Japanese. You'll slap me
if I tell you the meaning.

184
00:22:58,620 --> 00:22:59,580
What do you mean?

185
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,080
Hello, Vinod.
- What's wrong, sir?

186
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:11,160
Recognize him?

187
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,620
Abu Sayyed Nazer.

188
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:15,620
Area of operations, St.
Petersburg.

189
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:17,790
Main business, drugs,
prostitution.

190
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:19,830
Also money laundering.

191
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,870
Single point contact
between the Russian mafia...

192
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:23,660
...and terror groups like
Lashkar.

193
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:25,540
Rajan is handling this, right?

194
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,700
Rajan posed as his bodyguard
for the past three months.

195
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:31,040
He had managed to
get very close to him.

196
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:33,700
Had?

197
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:37,250
Last night Rajan sent this
message.

198
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,120

199
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:42,750
Falcon 77 to Hasan Nawaz sir.

200
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:45,000
Sir, I've been exposed.

201
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:46,660
Abu has joined hands
with some Colonel.

202
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:47,950
I don't know who he is.

203
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:48,870
They were discussing

204
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:50,370
about a large amount of money

205
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:52,160
They were planning a
big strike against India.

206
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,040
During the discussion...

207
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,620
...the number 242 kept coming
up.

208
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:56,790
242 means something. I
don't know what but...

209
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,660
This has all the data about Abu.

210
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:24,450
Your contact in St.
Petersburg is Tatiana Renko.

211
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,410
Go find out why Rajan was
killed.

212
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:29,750
What is 242?

213
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:34,540
Air India announces the arrival
of flight no. AI 6536 to St.

00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:11,870
Welcome to St. Petersburg.

216
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:15,450

Whether he's asleep.
- Okay.

221
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:28,950
Or in a meeting.

00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:30,290
Or the toilet.

223
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:31,830
Wait for him.
- Okay.

224
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:35,330
Hand this over to him
personally.

225
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:37,120
Who?
- Mr. Kazan.

226
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,620
Once more.

Mr. Kazan.

228
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:15,000
"I'll do the talking tonight."

229
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:19,120
"Let's talk about love."

230
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:22,370
"I'll do the talking tonight."

231
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:26,620
"Let's freak out."

232
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:31,040
"Whatever has happened..."

233
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:34,750
"...is the past."

234
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,450
"What you've right now."

235
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:42,120
"This is your moment."

236
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:46,450
"Steal the night and
have a good time."

237
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:49,450
"Why are you sitting alone?"

238
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:53,790
"Feel the vibe and
get into the groove."

239
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:56,700
"Live every moment."

240
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:04,700
"Blow away your sorrows."

241
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:07,870
Show.

242
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,660
Drink for all.

243
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:37,450
Victor, sit. You're not dead.

244
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:42,290
How about a game with me?

245
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,910
If you win, she's yours.

246
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,870
Come here, baby.

247
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,290
You haven't seen my cards yet.

248
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:18,790
I have three aces. Are you
blind?

249
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:21,330
"I'll do the talking tonight."

250
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:48,950
"I'll do the talking tonight."

251
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:53,410
"Taste the sweetness of love."

252
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:56,290
"I'll do the talking tonight."

253
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:00,750
"Let's have a good time
tonight."

254
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:04,910
"Whatever you lost."

255
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:08,660
"Is the punishment for your
pranks."

256
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:12,370
"If you have lost
it unintentionally."

257
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,910
"Then come, have a good time."

258
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:20,500
"Steal the night and
have a good time."

259
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:23,540
"Why are you sitting alone?"

260
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:26,950
This gun has real bullets.

261
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:30,870
"Live every moment."

262
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:43,290
Rajan Sinha, whose corpse was
found on the tracks outside
Moscow...

263
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:44,580
...was a friend of mine.

264
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:46,790
Be sure, your corpse
will never be found.

265
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,410
No last wishes for you, my
friend.

266
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:54,750
What is 242?

267
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:56,910
Nikolai!

268
00:29:56,910 --> 00:29:58,870
Call the others!

269
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:00,200
Call them now!
- Stay their Nikolai!

270
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:06,120
Here is an easier question?

271
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:08,290
Recognize this song?

272
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:28,700
Stop! Stop! Stop!

273
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,790
One ear drum and one stanza to
go...

274
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:46,750
What is 242?

275
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:51,160
The Colonel asked me to
send $50 million to Kazan.

276
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,160

242 is the size of Abu's
bazooka.

281
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,120
Wanna see?

282
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:44,250
Would you like to
come home for coffee?

283
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:49,080
Sorry my dear. Got
a flight to catch.

284
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:51,750
There are ten emergency
exits on this aircraft.

285
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:53,500
They are all clearly marked.

286
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:56,330
In an emergency the floor
path lights will illuminate...

287
00:31:56,330 --> 00:31:58,040
...and guide you
to the nearest exit.

288
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:03,830
Would you like some water?

289
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:05,910
Thank you.

I... I...

296
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,200
I am on duty, sir.

297
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,540
I am not allowed to wear
perfume.

298
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:27,040
100% natural.

299
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,750
Love it.
- Thank you, sir.

300
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:30,870

Are you okay?
- Yes, I am perfect.

302
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,250
Thank you.

303
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:37,580
You are very naughty, sir.

304
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:38,870
So sorry.

305
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,160
Taxi.

306
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,000
Taxi. Taxi. Taxi.

307
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,700
Hindi. Indian. Indian. Indian.

308
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,410
Come, come.

309
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,620
Shoot the rascal.

310
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:42,870
Move aside.

311
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,290
Zilleh.

312
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:05,080
Zilleh.

313
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:17,700
Zilleh, my darling.

314
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:20,120
Zilleh.

315
00:34:20,910 --> 00:34:23,000
Zilleh.

316
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,580
Mr. Freddie Khambatta?

317
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:20,830
Hello sir.

318
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,830
Abu sent this, for you.

319
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,370
Drink, Mr. Freddie?

320
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:39,250
Sure.

321
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:49,250
How is my friend Abu?

322
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:51,580
He's on cloud nine.

323
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:55,660
Your first visit to Morocco?
- Yes.

324
00:35:56,830 --> 00:35:58,450
Welcome to Morocco.

325
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,830
What are you doing, Mr. Kazan?

326
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:09,700
Abu said deliver
the note to Kazan...

327
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,370
...and collect $10,000.

328
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:15,000
What the hell are
you injecting me with?

329
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:26,870
Abu was murdered last night
- What?

330
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:29,290
Who are you?
- I am Freddie Khambatta, sir.

331
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:30,500
Increase the dose!

332
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:33,540
What the hell?

333
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:36,160
Relax. Don't be afraid.

334
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:37,870
Tell me your name?

336
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:43,330
Who killed Abu?

337
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,160
Don't hit him so hard.

338
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:46,120
Ask him?

339
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:50,910
What is your name?
- Freddie.

340
00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:54,580

342
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:57,750
Where does your mother live?

She lives in Baroda.

344
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:03,120
What does your mother do in
Baroda?

345
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,000
What does she do?

346
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:08,660

Look here

351
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:30,450
Look at me.

What does your mother call you?

353
00:37:43,330 --> 00:37:45,450
What does she call
you when she's angry?

354

355
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:58,370
Tell me!

00:38:34,370 --> 00:38:36,950
My name is Anthony Gonsalves.

365
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:40,660
I am all alone in this world.

366
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:43,660
What is he blabbering?
Increase the dose.

367
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:47,870
Just relax. Stop.

368
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:52,910
What nonsense.

369
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:55,910
Who killed Abu?

370
00:39:03,330 --> 00:39:04,790
Who killed Abu?

371
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:08,160
Who killed Abu?

372
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:11,040
Who are you?
- Who killed Abu?

373
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,000
Who are you?

374
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:15,290
Who killed Abu?

375
00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:17,040
Who are you?

376
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:19,120
Who killed Abu?

377
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,370
Say it.

378
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,290
Who are you?

379
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:24,870
I...

380
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,290
I am a RAW agent.

381
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:31,910
I killed Abu.

382
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:36,370
"Ra Ra Rasputin, lover
of the Russian queen."

383
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:40,040
"It was a shame how he carried
on."

384
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:10,910
Did you get the money?

385
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:12,410
Forget the money.

386
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:15,040
Do you know what you said?

387
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:20,040
What did I say?
- You killed Abu.

388
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:22,290
You are a RAW agent.

389
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:24,700
Did I say that?

390
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:26,750
How much Pentothal
did you give me, madam?

391
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:27,700
50 ml.

392
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:30,790
Thanks. Yes I killed Abu

393
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:33,290
...because he had a RAW
agent working under his nose.

394
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:34,500
His bodyguard.

395
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,790
Mahim Murtaza.

396
00:40:35,790 --> 00:40:37,450
Real name Rajan Sinha.

397
00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:39,950
Who do you work for?

398
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:41,500
Who do you work for?

399
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,790
You know we're not
supposed to take names, right?

400
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:48,040
Abu slipped up.

401
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:50,370
And I was sent here to check
if...

402
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:52,500
...David Kazan too is slipping
up.

403
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,040
But look what you did to me?

404
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,410
Bravo, Mr. Kazan.

405
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:03,370
Can I get a towel, please?

406
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:05,870
I got the money but...

407
00:41:05,870 --> 00:41:07,540
...there's something
fishy about this Freddie

408
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,870
Shall I kill him?

409
00:41:14,290 --> 00:41:16,040
Why don't you stay the night?

410
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,040
What is on your mind, Mr. Kazan?

411
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,410
Who is that doctor?

412
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,330
Ruby Mendes.

413
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,500
My personal doctor.

414
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,910
Ruby Mendes. Nice name.

415
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:33,620
Did you give her that name?
- Meaning?

416
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:35,450
Bathroom.
- What?

417
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:36,450
Bathroom?

418
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:40,830
Thank you.

419
00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:47,700
I am so sorry, madam.

420
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:48,750
Excuse me.

421
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,040
You should have told
me someone's inside.

422
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:54,500
Who is it?
- I don't know.

423
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,580
Some lady.

424
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:57,540
She's sitting on the commode,
reading a magazine.

425
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:15,080
There is no one here.

426
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:17,830
What?

427
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:19,450
She was right here...

428
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:25,660
Where did she disappear?

429
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:27,950
She was reading that magazine.

430
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:31,250
She was wearing a blue kaftan.
Big necklace around the neck...

431
00:42:31,870 --> 00:42:33,750
...and a strange tattoo here.

432
00:42:34,410 --> 00:42:35,500
She was right here.

433
00:42:43,450 --> 00:42:44,450
It was her.

434
00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:46,540
My mother.

435
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:50,000
She passed away 22 years ago.

436
00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:51,370
What?

437
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:55,540
What the hell did
you inject me with?

438
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:05,250
You need rest, Mr. Freddie.

439
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:08,000
Rest.

440
00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:11,450
Show him to his room.

441
00:43:11,450 --> 00:43:13,790
Goodnight, Mr. Kazan.
- Goodnight.

442
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:23,950
Hello, Dr. Ruby.

443
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:35,120
If you're feeling dizzy
then take these pills...

444
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:36,290
And eat something.

445
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:39,620
I had two bottles of water.

446
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:41,870
Yet everything looks 3D.

447
00:44:42,370 --> 00:44:45,160
Drink?
- No, thanks.

448
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,870
Kazan told me that
you saw his mother.

449
00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:52,500
I think I saw a ghost.

450
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,910
Do you believe in ghosts?

451
00:44:56,830 --> 00:44:58,200
What nonsense.

452
00:44:58,910 --> 00:45:00,040
39 dead.

453
00:45:00,870 --> 00:45:02,580
Don't they haunt you?

454
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,870
The ghosts of those who
died in the London blast.

455
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:11,330
I am impressed.

456
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:14,250
You escaped from a British jail.

457
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:16,540
...have been evading Interpol.

458
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:18,870
I am impressed... Miss

459
00:45:18,870 --> 00:45:21,000
Iram Parveen Bilal.

460
00:45:22,870 --> 00:45:25,250
Iram Parveen Bilal is dead.

461
00:45:26,870 --> 00:45:28,330
My name is Ruby.

462
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:31,500
Goodnight, Freddie.

463
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:03,450
Does he know about the spycam?

464
00:46:03,450 --> 00:46:04,580
He knows about me.

465
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:12,250
Yes.

466
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:16,000
A tourist group has
just landed from London.

467
00:46:17,950 --> 00:46:20,000
There's an Ml6 agent amongst
them.

468
00:46:20,910 --> 00:46:23,250
Maybe he knows about 242.

469
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:38,790
I am going out for a walk.

470
00:46:39,290 --> 00:46:40,910
If you want to keep an eye on
me...

471
00:46:40,910 --> 00:46:42,700
...then send Dr. Ruby along...

472
00:46:43,330 --> 00:46:44,160
Here.

473
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:06,250
I don't think you
exploded that bomb...

474
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:10,620
Why do you say that?

475
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,410
You have killer eyes...

476
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:21,160
But they're not
the eyes of a killer.

477
00:47:24,370 --> 00:47:26,620
Tell that to my London court
judge.

478
00:47:35,750 --> 00:47:37,500
You know everything about me.

479
00:47:37,870 --> 00:47:39,620
Tell me something about
yourself.

480
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:41,330
I cannot lie.

481
00:47:41,330 --> 00:47:42,910
And you'll catch me
if I tell the truth.

482
00:47:43,370 --> 00:47:45,660
I am in the same business as
you.

483
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:47,160
But why are we talking shop

484
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:48,580
...in a romantic place like
Tangier?

485
00:47:49,330 --> 00:47:51,040
If you weren't so serious...

486
00:47:51,450 --> 00:47:53,540
...I would've invited
you to dinner this evening.

487
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:55,540
And cooked for you too.

488
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:57,120
I am a good cook.

489
00:47:58,330 --> 00:47:59,870
What's on the menu?

490
00:48:00,450 --> 00:48:02,540
Wow. That means yes.

491
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:04,910
Well, that's a Kodak moment.

492
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:08,040
May I take a picture, madam?

493
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,330
Excuse me?

494
00:48:11,330 --> 00:48:12,580
Excuse me?
- Yes?

495
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:13,750
Do you speak English?
- Yes... yes.

496
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:15,370
Can you take a photo of
me and my wife, please?

497
00:48:15,370 --> 00:48:16,410
Okay.

498
00:48:16,410 --> 00:48:18,080
How is Freddie?
- very happy

499
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:19,870
Richard Maibaum, British Agent.

500
00:48:19,870 --> 00:48:22,410
He's the Ml6 agent in-charge
of the Middle East sector.

501
00:48:22,410 --> 00:48:23,620
Something's happening.

502
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:24,790
Where can I find him?

503
00:48:24,790 --> 00:48:26,040
Hotel Rif & Spa.

504
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:28,290
Room no. 430. I am
sending you a photo.

505
00:48:28,290 --> 00:48:29,910
Understood. Understood.

506
00:48:29,910 --> 00:48:30,950
Photo?

507
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:32,080
Not good here.

508
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:33,250
Fountain. - Okay.

509
00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:34,830
Madam, fountain please.

510
00:48:36,450 --> 00:48:37,580
Ready.

511
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:40,000
Smile.

512
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:41,410
Thank you.

513
00:48:41,410 --> 00:48:43,160
Enjoy your honeymoon.

514
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:45,160
Shall we?

515
00:48:45,950 --> 00:48:47,200
Have lunch.

516
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:49,910
I know a nice place.

517
00:48:50,410 --> 00:48:52,120
Hotel Rif & Spa.

518
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:10,000
"Your deep blue eyes."

519
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:12,450
"...with secrets hidden within"

520
00:49:12,830 --> 00:49:16,500
"Praise the Lord for
creating one such as you"

521
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:22,790
How many girls
have you said this to?

522
00:49:22,790 --> 00:49:25,790
Including you? 242.

523
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:33,910
You've brought $ 50
million to buy 242.

524
00:49:34,790 --> 00:49:36,750
Do you know what 242 is?

525
00:49:37,790 --> 00:49:39,370
What did Kazan tell you?

526
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:40,870
Excuse me, madam.

527
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:42,250
The menu.

528
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:44,410
Thank you.

529
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:24,370
Excuse me.

530
00:51:53,450 --> 00:51:55,250
I am not feeling well.

531
00:51:55,250 --> 00:51:56,790
I have to go back.

532
00:51:56,790 --> 00:51:58,910
Of course, no problem.

533
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:05,950
I hope you will come with me
to the auction this evening.

534
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:17,200
There are some other bidders
but don't worry. I'll get 242

535
00:52:18,790 --> 00:52:20,120
Sir Jagdeshwar

536
00:52:24,790 --> 00:52:28,040
Thank you, Ladies and
Gentlemen...

537
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:31,370
...for your most
generous contributions.

538
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:36,540
I am going to match the sums
that have been raised here
today...

539
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:42,830
...and this money will help in
building schools and
hospitals...

540
00:52:42,830 --> 00:52:44,540
...in this lovely,
this great country.

541
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:46,450
Good evening, Sir.

542
00:52:46,450 --> 00:52:48,870
Your face reassures
me that all is well.

543
00:52:51,950 --> 00:52:55,250
242. The Rubaiyat of Omar
Khayyam.

544
00:52:55,250 --> 00:52:58,200
Poems on love and destiny
written in the 11th century.

545
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:00,160
Very nice.

546
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:02,950
Good luck.

547
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:09,290
Why did you get him here?

548
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:11,410
He got me here.

549
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,290
I should be keeping a
watch on you instead.

550
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:24,500
Found this in Richard's room.

551
00:53:25,790 --> 00:53:27,120
You must have dropped it in a
hurry.

552
00:53:27,620 --> 00:53:30,830
No, I didn't. When
did you flick this?

553
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:32,870
And who is Richard?

554
00:53:32,870 --> 00:53:35,040
Relax, we're on the same side.

555
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:38,120
Next item is a YU Rain mask.

556
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:40,080
An emblem of the YU tribe.

557
00:53:41,370 --> 00:53:42,250
Please.

558
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:43,660
Hello.

559
00:53:44,450 --> 00:53:46,250
I am Jagdish.

560
00:53:46,250 --> 00:53:47,700
Great honour to meet you Sir.

561
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:49,830
Freddie Khambatta. Dr. Ruby
Mendes.

562
00:53:55,330 --> 00:53:57,160
From India?
- India.

563
00:53:58,330 --> 00:53:59,450
Pakistan.

564
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:04,200
Sworn enemies...

565
00:54:04,790 --> 00:54:07,620
Can become great friends too.

566
00:54:09,370 --> 00:54:12,250
Are you here for anything
special?

567
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:14,120
She's interested in the
Rubaiyat.

568
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:15,790
And I am interested in her.

569
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:18,330
I see.

570
00:54:27,450 --> 00:54:28,450
Excuse me.

571
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,290
Hello, prince.

572
00:54:54,290 --> 00:54:55,370
What are you doing here?

573
00:55:18,790 --> 00:55:20,790
Where is Daya Master?

574
00:55:51,950 --> 00:55:53,910
I thought the Tigers were
finished.

575
00:55:53,910 --> 00:55:54,950
What are you doing here?

576
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:58,410
Tell me.

577
00:55:58,410 --> 00:55:59,910
Item no. 242.

578
00:55:59,910 --> 00:56:01,910
Since when did you start
reading poetry, Prince?

579
00:56:01,910 --> 00:56:03,000
What is 242?

580
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,950
The next item is lot no. 242.

581
00:56:06,950 --> 00:56:12,000
A collection of love poems
from Persian poet Omar Khayyam.

582
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:15,830
The opening bid for
this will be $75,000.

583
00:56:15,830 --> 00:56:17,870
$75,000 from the
gentleman at the back.

584
00:56:17,870 --> 00:56:18,660
Thank you very much.

585
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:21,500
$90,000. $125,000.

586
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:25,450
$400,000. $450,000.

587
00:56:25,450 --> 00:56:26,830
Come on, prince. Come on.

588
00:56:26,830 --> 00:56:29,080
$500,000, going once.

589
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:30,000
It's a bomb.

590
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:30,830
Going twice.

591
00:56:30,830 --> 00:56:32,620
KV series, Russian.

592
00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:33,500
Nuclear bomb?

593
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:34,950
Sold.

594
00:56:34,950 --> 00:56:38,750
Lot no. 242, the
Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam...

595
00:56:38,750 --> 00:56:42,790
...sold to Mr. David Kazan
for half a million dollars.

596
00:56:42,790 --> 00:56:43,950
Excuse me.

597
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:51,330
Where were you, Mr. Khambatta?

598
00:56:51,790 --> 00:56:54,200
Ruby and the Rubaiyat are both
gone.

599
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:56,370
Thank you.

600
00:58:22,950 --> 00:58:24,200
For activation, in those days

601
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:27,700
...the command validation of a
Russian satellite was required

602
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:30,620
But we have made changes.

603
00:58:30,620 --> 00:58:32,370
You need to enter a
password that's all...

604
00:58:32,370 --> 00:58:34,450
...that is required for
activation.

605
00:58:34,450 --> 00:58:38,750
This Rubaiyat of Omar
Khayyam is the detonator.

606
00:58:39,950 --> 00:58:41,200
Don't lose it.

607
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:18,200
So, my congratulations, Mr.
Kazan.
- Thank you.

608
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:21,200
And thank you, Dr. Rana,
for your contributions.

609
00:59:26,580 --> 00:59:29,080
What time is flight, Dr. Rana?

610
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:43,290
Thank you.
- Cheers.

611
00:59:43,290 --> 00:59:45,000
Cheers.

612
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:48,500
Dr. Rana, this is the
best champagne in the world.

613
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:50,410
And you are drinking water.

614
01:00:04,410 --> 01:00:05,580
His job was done.

615
01:00:06,790 --> 01:00:08,370
Can you take care of him?

616
01:00:25,290 --> 01:00:26,830
Freddie Khambatta.

617
01:00:28,450 --> 01:00:29,910
I am Colonel.

618
01:00:30,790 --> 01:00:32,120
Why are you standing here?

619
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:33,700
Join the party.

620
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:36,500
Party's over, Colonel.

621
01:00:36,790 --> 01:00:38,330
The party's just begun.

622
01:00:42,910 --> 01:00:45,450
If you see my mother again...

623
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:48,500
...then tell her I said Hi.

624
01:00:48,830 --> 01:00:51,450
Whoever he is, get rid of him.

625
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:56,370
Hello, my dear.

626
01:01:09,660 --> 01:01:11,500
The pipeline goes
through this lane...

627
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:14,120
...and we have an observation
post every 10 kilometers.

628
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:17,120
Sir, there's a call for you.

629
01:01:19,910 --> 01:01:20,870
Hello.

630
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:26,500
Hello, Mr. Nawaz.

631
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:28,540
Hello, Mr. lftekhaar.

632
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:31,790
I can hear raging
fire and roaring rain.

633
01:01:32,540 --> 01:01:33,620
You are in Chaman.

634
01:01:33,910 --> 01:01:35,620
Impressive, Mr. Nawaz.

635
01:01:35,620 --> 01:01:37,580
Even at this age, you
still have keen ears.

636
01:01:37,580 --> 01:01:39,120
I can even hear what's
happening in Morocco.

637
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:43,370
I just heard that David
Kazan has bought a nuclear bomb.

638
01:01:43,830 --> 01:01:45,660
What? Where did you
get this news from?

639
01:01:47,700 --> 01:01:50,160
Mr. Nawaz, you will have to
share your source with me.

640
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:52,290
Because if there's
any truth in this...

641
01:01:52,290 --> 01:01:53,500
...then we'll need to cooperate.

642
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:54,830
Tell me, General.

643
01:01:55,290 --> 01:01:56,370
Are you involved?

644
01:01:56,370 --> 01:01:57,750
I have no idea.

645
01:01:57,750 --> 01:01:59,290
I didn't know at all.

646
01:01:59,290 --> 01:02:00,660
If I had any clue about this...

647
01:02:00,660 --> 01:02:02,160
...then I would have
called you myself.

648
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:05,040
Look, Mr. lftekhaar,
whatever the problems between
us...

649
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:06,540
...this cannot be the solution.

650
01:02:06,540 --> 01:02:07,620
Thank you very much.

651
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,450
Give me 12 hours. I
will call you back.

652
01:02:10,910 --> 01:02:11,950
Goodbye.

653
01:02:25,250 --> 01:02:26,330
Cancel the inspection.

654
01:02:26,330 --> 01:02:27,750
We will return to
Islamabad right now.

655
01:02:27,750 --> 01:02:30,120
Hello. Cancel my trip to China.

656
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:31,250
And call an emergency meeting...

657
01:02:31,250 --> 01:02:32,500
...of all the
section chiefs tomorrow.

658
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:34,040
Specially section Q, okay.

659
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:35,000
Fine.

660
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:50,000
Take lftekhaar sir's
convoy to the Turkhum border...

661
01:02:50,750 --> 01:02:52,830
...and blow it up with a
launcher.

662
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:38,660
I'll keep you posted, sir.

663
01:04:39,330 --> 01:04:40,450
Breaking news.

664
01:04:40,950 --> 01:04:43,330
ISI chief lftekhaar
Ahmed killed in a bomb blast.

665
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:11,450
Is this Zaheer's home?

666
01:05:11,450 --> 01:05:14,700
This is Zaheer's home,
but he is on the terrace.

667
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:15,450
Thank You!

668
01:05:15,450 --> 01:05:16,000
You're welcome

669
01:05:51,830 --> 01:05:52,700
Who are you?

670
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:53,660
I am Freddie.

671
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:55,580
Freddie Khambatta.
- What?

672
01:05:55,580 --> 01:05:57,200
Yes. I am Freddie.

673
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:59,620
If you are Freddie then who is
he?

674
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:06,080
So you were telling
the truth that day.

675
01:06:06,540 --> 01:06:07,700
You are a RAW agent!

676
01:06:07,700 --> 01:06:08,870
Who is the Colonel?

677
01:06:09,370 --> 01:06:11,870
Where is the bomb? - That's
what I came here to find out.

678
01:06:12,290 --> 01:06:13,870
I thought you knew about him.

679
01:06:13,870 --> 01:06:15,950
She's trying to confuse us.

680
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:18,160
Where is the bomb?

681
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,370
I am on your side.

682
01:06:22,660 --> 01:06:24,660
I work for the British
Intelligence.

683
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:27,410
And you killed that British
agent?

684
01:06:27,410 --> 01:06:29,080
I didn't kill Richard.

685
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:30,500
He was my handler.

686
01:06:31,330 --> 01:06:33,750
I went there to
inform him about you.

687
01:06:33,750 --> 01:06:35,160
To show him your face.

688
01:06:36,620 --> 01:06:39,000
You killed 40 people in London.

689
01:06:39,910 --> 01:06:42,200
You were smiling as
you got out of the car.

690
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:43,750
You were smiling.

691
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:51,040
I was smiling, because I was
happy.

692
01:06:53,750 --> 01:06:55,120
It was a beautiful day.

693
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:56,660
Boss, why are you
listening to this nonsense?

694
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,450
I am responsible for the
death of those 40 people.

695
01:07:03,290 --> 01:07:05,120
Because my own friends...

696
01:07:06,330 --> 01:07:08,330
...had planted the bomb in my
car.

697
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:13,040
I was waiting for them.

698
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:18,080
If I wasn't feeling hungry...

699
01:07:18,790 --> 01:07:20,410
...and hadn't stepped out...

700
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:24,830
...then the blast
would have killed me...

701
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:31,830
When one of the group
was caught in Pakistan...

702
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:36,910
...then ISI chief
lftekhaar Ahmed came to see me.

703
01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:40,120
He was convinced that I am
innocent.

704
01:07:40,910 --> 01:07:42,500
He convinced Richard.

705
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:44,410
They said that they will help
me...

706
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:47,500
...but I will have to work for
them.

707
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:48,870
They sprung me out of jail...

708
01:07:49,540 --> 01:07:52,080
...and sent me to Morocco, to
Kazan.

709
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:57,000
Kazan buys drugs from
terrorists,
and supplies arms.

710
01:07:58,450 --> 01:08:00,120
So you are an ISI agent?

711
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:02,330
I just report to lftekhaar Sir.

712
01:08:02,330 --> 01:08:03,830
He knows the truth about me.

713
01:08:04,290 --> 01:08:07,410
Last month I intercepted Abu
Nazir's phone call from
Moscow...

714
01:08:07,410 --> 01:08:10,410
...that Freddie Khambatta is
arriving with $50 million.

715
01:08:11,040 --> 01:08:13,790
I informed Richard, that's
why he came here personally.

716
01:08:13,790 --> 01:08:15,450
Can you prove this?

717
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,330
Talk to lftekhaar sir.

718
01:08:17,950 --> 01:08:19,120
He knows me.

719
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:20,700
lftekhaar Ahmed is dead.

720
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:25,450
He's dead?

721
01:08:27,370 --> 01:08:28,580
And Richard too.

722
01:08:29,830 --> 01:08:33,330
Now there's no one
left to prove your story.

723
01:08:33,330 --> 01:08:34,200
Zahir.

724
01:08:40,790 --> 01:08:41,700
Come here.

725
01:08:45,410 --> 01:08:46,290
He's one of them.

726
01:08:46,870 --> 01:08:48,500
Now he knows about you.

727
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,290
Shoot him.

728
01:08:57,450 --> 01:08:58,450
No.

729
01:08:59,700 --> 01:09:01,450
I cannot kill anyone.

730
01:09:01,830 --> 01:09:02,870
Not even him.

731
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:06,080
I don't know where the bomb is.

732
01:09:06,950 --> 01:09:08,750
But the Rubaiyat is the trigger.

733
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:10,790
The bomb is
useless without Rubaiyat.

734
01:09:11,540 --> 01:09:13,620
And right now
Rubaiyat is in Kazan's safe.

735
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:15,750
If you believe me then let me
go.

736
01:09:15,750 --> 01:09:17,580
I know the combination of that
safe.

737
01:09:17,580 --> 01:09:18,500
Otherwise go yourself.

738
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:20,870
But for God's sake get
that Rubaiyat out of there.

739
01:09:24,750 --> 01:09:25,540
Let's go.

740
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:27,120
Come on.

741
01:09:42,700 --> 01:09:43,750
20 minutes.

742
01:09:44,370 --> 01:09:45,250
Good luck, Iram.

743
01:10:00,950 --> 01:10:02,080
She was lying.

744
01:10:03,910 --> 01:10:05,450
You believed her?

745
01:10:05,450 --> 01:10:06,750
She was telling the truth.

746
01:10:47,790 --> 01:10:50,120
I have the Rubaiyat and the
location of the bomb as well.

747
01:10:50,950 --> 01:10:54,250
Meet me at Golden Farah
restaurant,
in 20 minutes.

748
01:11:53,620 --> 01:11:58,290
"My friends deserted me."

749
01:11:58,870 --> 01:12:03,160
"My love deserted me."

750
01:12:03,660 --> 01:12:07,160
"Life's so.."

751
01:12:07,660 --> 01:12:08,750
Indian?

752
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:11,200
Oh, good. Number one.

753
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:44,290
Goodbye to Morocco.

754
01:14:17,330 --> 01:14:19,200
Indian?
- Yes.

755
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:20,250
I am Suresh Krishna.

756
01:14:20,250 --> 01:14:21,290
That's funny...

757
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:22,700
My name is also Suresh Krishna.

758
01:14:24,250 --> 01:14:26,370
By the way, I work
for the United Nations.

759
01:14:26,370 --> 01:14:28,370
Deputy Health
Commissioner for Africa.

760
01:14:29,830 --> 01:14:31,000
Is this a joke?

761
01:14:31,370 --> 01:14:33,950
I am the Deputy Health
Commissioner for Africa.

762
01:15:12,290 --> 01:15:15,000
We need to ask you some
questions,
Mr. Shastri.

763
01:15:15,660 --> 01:15:16,660
How are you feeling?

764
01:15:18,250 --> 01:15:19,290
I am hungry.

765
01:15:34,450 --> 01:15:36,750
We found Mr. Kazan's
address in your pocket.

766
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:39,750
He's dead. His
house has been burgled.

767
01:15:39,750 --> 01:15:41,040
How do you know him?
- I mean him in an auction.

768
01:15:41,580 --> 01:15:43,410
Don't disturb the patient
please.

769
01:15:47,370 --> 01:15:48,620
Officers. Please step outside.

770
01:15:49,660 --> 01:15:51,410
I need to examine the patient

771
01:15:52,540 --> 01:15:53,540
Officers.

772
01:15:53,540 --> 01:15:54,750
I will see you in some time.

773
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:02,370
Good morning.
- Good morning, Doctor.

774
01:16:03,370 --> 01:16:06,040
Three bullets and
you're still alive.

775
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:07,500
You must be really lucky.

776
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,450
Do you believe in luck?

777
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:14,700
If I believed in luck I'd be
dead a long time ago, Doctor.

778
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:17,910
I see.

779
01:16:26,450 --> 01:16:28,120
Do you believe in luck, doctor?

780
01:16:39,160 --> 01:16:39,410
Where is she?

781
01:16:42,120 --> 01:16:43,410
Where is she?

782
01:16:43,410 --> 01:16:43,870
Where is she?

783
01:16:44,290 --> 01:16:44,950
Riga.

784
01:16:45,250 --> 01:16:45,870
Riga.

785
01:17:00,450 --> 01:17:02,040
Do you know where they are?

786
01:17:39,540 --> 01:17:41,370
Look at that man closely.

787
01:17:55,540 --> 01:17:56,910
Anton Brega.

788
01:17:56,910 --> 01:17:59,620
Considers himself a Casanova.

789
01:17:59,620 --> 01:18:01,950
He is an alcoholic...
and a womanizer

790
01:18:01,950 --> 01:18:03,870
He has one more bad habit.

791
01:18:04,410 --> 01:18:05,450
He's honest.

792
01:18:06,580 --> 01:18:08,410
He's the Airport Security chief.

793
01:18:08,410 --> 01:18:12,160
There's a pass card in
his wallet which I want.

794
01:18:12,750 --> 01:18:15,200
We'll be done by 2
o'clock tomorrow afternoon.

795
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:18,580
Until then you will have to
keep him out of the airport.

796
01:18:18,580 --> 01:18:21,500
So... you have to
spend the night with him.

797
01:18:25,370 --> 01:18:27,580
Get lost! I am not your
property!

798
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:29,750
Bloody reptile!

799
01:18:33,700 --> 01:18:35,120
I just want to die.

800
01:18:35,450 --> 01:18:37,660
No, actually, I just
want to get drunk.

801
01:18:43,750 --> 01:18:46,370
Sorry.
- No, that's okay. That's fine.

802
01:18:46,870 --> 01:18:48,000
Give me another one.

803
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:49,950
What do you want? Just get lost.

804
01:18:49,950 --> 01:18:52,370
Okay. Sir, please.

805
01:18:53,580 --> 01:18:54,750
Thank you.

806
01:18:58,450 --> 01:19:01,080
Anton Brega.
- Josie.

807
01:19:01,750 --> 01:19:03,950
Nice to meet you, Josie.

808
01:19:16,540 --> 01:19:18,290
I told you to get lost.

809
01:20:20,950 --> 01:20:23,000
We just got out of the third
casino.

810
01:20:25,410 --> 01:20:26,950
He has won around three-four
lakhs.

811
01:20:27,410 --> 01:20:29,160
He says I am lucky for him.

812
01:20:29,870 --> 01:20:31,410
Now he wants to take me home.

813
01:20:31,790 --> 01:20:32,870
Two more hours.

814
01:20:32,870 --> 01:20:34,250
Our job will be done.

815
01:20:34,250 --> 01:20:35,830
Take him to Hotel Riga. 405.

816
01:20:35,830 --> 01:20:37,910
There's a room booked
in the name of Josie.

817
01:20:38,250 --> 01:20:42,080
Darling, I've got some
special champagne for you.

818
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:43,750
That's for you. Look at it.

819
01:20:54,660 --> 01:20:55,950
Goodbye.

820
01:21:10,450 --> 01:21:11,500
Hello, sir.

821
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:12,330
Welcome to Riga.

822
01:21:12,700 --> 01:21:14,250
Mr. Nawaz called from Delhi.

823
01:21:14,250 --> 01:21:15,450
This packet is for you.

824
01:21:19,660 --> 01:21:21,000
Any news about those two?

825
01:21:24,790 --> 01:21:27,290
"My darling, I said."

826
01:21:27,290 --> 01:21:29,500
"My darling, you heard it."

827
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:33,500
"Our hearts
communicated with each other."

828
01:21:58,370 --> 01:22:00,290
"My darling, I said."

829
01:22:00,950 --> 01:22:03,200
"My darling, you heard it."

830
01:22:04,040 --> 01:22:06,620
"My darling, I said."

831
01:22:12,410 --> 01:22:13,370
Hello.

832
01:22:14,450 --> 01:22:15,620
Excuse me.

833
01:22:22,160 --> 01:22:23,000
Yes.

834
01:22:23,540 --> 01:22:25,500
That Brega is after me.

835
01:22:25,500 --> 01:22:26,790
He's about to jump on me.

836
01:22:26,790 --> 01:22:27,700
Relax.

837
01:22:28,250 --> 01:22:29,540
Open the mini bar.

838
01:22:29,870 --> 01:22:31,700
There's a chocolate box inside.

839
01:22:31,700 --> 01:22:32,790
Feed him some of those
chocolates.

840
01:22:32,790 --> 01:22:34,540
He'll pass out for a few hours.

841
01:22:34,540 --> 01:22:36,410
What about the package?
- You want to see it?

842
01:22:36,950 --> 01:22:39,120
Knock him out and leave right
away.

843
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:40,120
Okay, fine.

844
01:22:46,160 --> 01:22:48,830
I was waiting for
you at Golden Farah.

845
01:22:49,450 --> 01:22:50,540
Thank God you are alive.

846
01:22:50,540 --> 01:22:53,410
Enough of your charade.
- Listen to me.

847
01:22:53,790 --> 01:22:56,580
Colonel had asked me to
- Where is the Colonel?

848
01:22:58,120 --> 01:23:00,000
I was just talking to him.

849
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,660
The bomb is here... in the city.

850
01:23:02,540 --> 01:23:03,750
The man in the room with me
is...

851
01:23:32,830 --> 01:23:34,330
You saved my life.

852
01:24:01,250 --> 01:24:03,080
Time for a little chat, Colonel.

853
01:24:20,040 --> 01:24:21,910
You okay?
- Get me out of here.

854
01:24:24,290 --> 01:24:25,790
Get here, now.

855
01:24:28,660 --> 01:24:29,790
Get down.

856
01:24:46,120 --> 01:24:46,910
Ready?

857
01:24:51,580 --> 01:24:52,700
Catch them.

858
01:25:27,790 --> 01:25:29,040
He's heading straight.

859
01:25:29,370 --> 01:25:30,450
He's taking a turn.

860
01:25:35,080 --> 01:25:36,330
He's near town square.

861
01:25:36,330 --> 01:25:38,040
Straight and left.

862
01:25:41,500 --> 01:25:42,790
20 kilometers from here.

863
01:25:45,750 --> 01:25:47,620
He has stopped near Maxima Mall.

864
01:26:08,290 --> 01:26:10,540
Don't you want to know why
I lied to you in Morocco

865
01:26:10,540 --> 01:26:12,870
Maybe you didn't like my shoes?

866
01:26:24,700 --> 01:26:26,370
'The Colonel had killed Kazan.'

867
01:26:26,370 --> 01:26:27,250
'He was about to kill me... '

868
01:26:28,830 --> 01:26:30,200
'And suddenly I saw... '

869
01:26:31,200 --> 01:26:34,660
'In another minute, Freddie
Khambatta
would've told him everything'

870
01:26:34,660 --> 01:26:37,330
'The man you think is Freddie
Khambatta is actually a RAW
agent.'

871
01:26:37,330 --> 01:26:39,410
'He's dead. - He's alive.
And he knows about the bomb.

872
01:26:39,410 --> 01:26:40,870
'I thought that if I told the
Colonel about you, I might gain his
trust.'

873
01:26:40,870 --> 01:26:41,790
'Where is he? '

874
01:26:41,790 --> 01:26:43,580
'Maybe he would involve me
in whatever his plan was...

875
01:26:44,660 --> 01:26:46,870
I did it to find out about the
bomb.

876
01:26:49,290 --> 01:26:50,700
'Sir, I am... '

877
01:26:50,700 --> 01:26:52,250
'Just a minute. Just a minute.'

878
01:26:52,250 --> 01:26:53,250
'Hold it.'

879
01:26:53,250 --> 01:26:55,660
'Sir, I am Freddie Khambatta.'

880
01:26:55,660 --> 01:26:56,790
'I am a flight purser.'

881
01:26:56,790 --> 01:26:58,700
'Abu gave me a $10 note.
What was his name? '

882
01:26:58,700 --> 01:27:00,910
'I don't know his name. He beat
me.'

883
01:27:00,910 --> 01:27:02,870
'He took the dollar I
was supposed to give you.'

884
01:27:05,660 --> 01:27:07,580
Colonel had taken my phone away.

885
01:27:08,250 --> 01:27:10,910
I snatched someone's
phone from the airport toilet

886
01:27:10,910 --> 01:27:12,160
...and tried calling you.

887
01:30:04,620 --> 01:30:06,500
How will you face three
armed men with one bullet?

888
01:30:15,330 --> 01:30:16,620
Don't be afraid.

889
01:30:16,620 --> 01:30:18,080
May God give your
husband a long life.

890
01:31:06,950 --> 01:31:08,370
It's stopped.

891
01:31:34,450 --> 01:31:35,200
Come here.

892
01:31:40,620 --> 01:31:42,160
Where did you get this?
- What is that?

893
01:31:42,160 --> 01:31:43,580
Where did you get this?
- I don't know. What is that?

894
01:31:43,580 --> 01:31:45,750
Where did you get this?
- I don't know.

895
01:31:45,750 --> 01:31:46,950
I am telling you, I don't know.

896
01:32:33,450 --> 01:32:35,040
Dr. Suresh Krishna.

897
01:32:35,040 --> 01:32:36,410
Dr. Suresh Krishna?

898
01:32:37,830 --> 01:32:38,830
We are waiting for you

899
01:32:38,830 --> 01:32:42,200
Sorry, sir. This is
portable X-ray machine no. 311.

900
01:33:03,910 --> 01:33:05,620
Maybe the colonel lied to you.

901
01:33:07,370 --> 01:33:10,750
Brega's pass was used not
to bring bomb into the city

902
01:33:11,660 --> 01:33:13,330
...but to take it out of the
city.

903
01:33:23,290 --> 01:33:25,250
13 flights have taken off..

904
01:33:25,250 --> 01:33:27,000
..since Brega's death...

905
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:28,660
...they can be
checked only on landing.

906
01:33:31,370 --> 01:33:33,620
The local police
want to question you.

907
01:33:33,620 --> 01:33:36,410
Cops in Moscow and Morocco
police want to question me as
well.

908
01:33:37,250 --> 01:33:38,500
You are in a queue.

909
01:33:39,160 --> 01:33:40,160
Keys please.

910
01:33:43,410 --> 01:33:44,500
I'll be in touch, sir.

911
01:33:55,910 --> 01:33:56,950
Where are they?

912
01:34:08,580 --> 01:34:10,750
They say you need too
eat to gain something.

913
01:34:12,250 --> 01:34:14,290
Whenever you get the
opportunity,
recharge.

914
01:34:14,830 --> 01:34:16,120
Sit down, eat something.

915
01:34:20,410 --> 01:34:21,410
What's on your mind?

916
01:34:22,040 --> 01:34:23,040
Wondering what happens next?

917
01:34:23,830 --> 01:34:25,700
Don't worry, we'll help you.

918
01:34:27,290 --> 01:34:28,790
You cannot help me.

919
01:34:30,540 --> 01:34:33,660
New identity, passport,
character certificate.

920
01:34:33,660 --> 01:34:34,950
Money.

921
01:34:34,950 --> 01:34:36,120
What do you want?

922
01:34:36,700 --> 01:34:38,000
What do I want?

923
01:34:39,200 --> 01:34:41,000
I want my life back.

924
01:34:42,330 --> 01:34:46,410
I want my father, who
died when I was in jail.

925
01:34:47,120 --> 01:34:49,950
I want the clinic, with
a board outside saying...

926
01:34:49,950 --> 01:34:51,580
...Doctor Iram Parveen Bilal.

927
01:34:52,660 --> 01:34:54,040
I want a home.

928
01:34:54,040 --> 01:34:55,910
A husband who's crazy about me.

929
01:34:56,750 --> 01:34:57,790
I want kids.

930
01:34:58,250 --> 01:34:59,790
I want a normal life.

931
01:35:00,450 --> 01:35:06,290
I want a world where the
Rubaiyat is just a book with beautiful
poetry.

932
01:35:07,910 --> 01:35:10,120
Not a nuclear bomb detonator.

933
01:35:19,500 --> 01:35:22,660
There's a circuit inside
that activates the bomb.

934
01:35:25,450 --> 01:35:27,120
I have some more information.

935
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:29,120
Take that as well.

936
01:35:30,200 --> 01:35:32,660
I overheard the Colonel
on the phone last night.

937
01:35:34,040 --> 01:35:36,580
He was fixing a meeting with
Taimoor Pasha on the 28th.

938
01:35:37,040 --> 01:35:38,290
At Hotel Gazebo.

939
01:35:38,290 --> 01:35:39,830
Hotel Gazebo is in Karachi.

940
01:35:41,120 --> 01:35:42,450
I don't know anything else.

941
01:35:43,200 --> 01:35:44,540
And I don't want to either.

942
01:35:49,080 --> 01:35:50,370
Can I go now?

943
01:35:51,830 --> 01:35:52,790
Where will you go?

944
01:35:52,790 --> 01:35:54,120
What will you do?

945
01:36:00,870 --> 01:36:02,040
Anywhere.

946
01:36:14,290 --> 01:36:15,830
I wanted to be a painter.

947
01:36:17,250 --> 01:36:18,750
I thought I will be famous.

948
01:36:19,450 --> 01:36:20,450
A house in the mountains.

949
01:36:20,450 --> 01:36:21,910
Exhibitions in Paris.

950
01:36:22,620 --> 01:36:24,080
Five marriages.

951
01:36:24,620 --> 01:36:26,830
Couple of kids from each
marriage...

952
01:36:28,580 --> 01:36:31,160
But the cable snapped.
- What?

953
01:36:31,160 --> 01:36:32,620
One of the cables of
the ropeway snapped.

954
01:36:33,410 --> 01:36:35,200
We were in Mussoorie,
on a school trip.

955
01:36:36,410 --> 01:36:38,700
The entire cabin was
dangling on one cable.

956
01:36:39,750 --> 01:36:41,660
A sheer 2000 feet deep drop
below.

957
01:36:42,700 --> 01:36:44,580
The other cable
could snap any moment...

958
01:36:45,200 --> 01:36:48,450
Plunging us to our death.
And then I climbed up.

959
01:36:50,870 --> 01:36:52,950
I clung to a rope for eight
minutes.

960
01:36:54,080 --> 01:36:55,290
And managed to secure the cable.

961
01:36:56,080 --> 01:36:57,620
I was 15 years old.

962
01:37:02,290 --> 01:37:04,540
I got a medal from
President Venkatraman.

963
01:37:06,540 --> 01:37:08,700
Those eight minutes changed my
life.

964
01:37:10,040 --> 01:37:11,790
I always wanted to return...

965
01:37:12,370 --> 01:37:14,750
...to that place
between life and death.

966
01:37:19,790 --> 01:37:21,750
I am still hanging from that
cable.

967
01:37:23,120 --> 01:37:24,450
The day I let go...

968
01:37:36,950 --> 01:37:40,200
In Delhi, when the dogs
from one lane start barking...

969
01:37:41,080 --> 01:37:43,580
...do you know what
the other dogs do?

970
01:38:17,750 --> 01:38:18,910
Good evening, sir.

971
01:38:19,830 --> 01:38:22,040
Sir, we've to leave for
the airport in an hour.

972
01:38:22,040 --> 01:38:23,000
You're leaving for London.

973
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:24,540
They are waiting for
you at the Embassy.

974
01:38:24,540 --> 01:38:25,790
I've got all the documents with
me.

975
01:38:28,580 --> 01:38:31,790
Passports. Documents
and some money, sir.

976
01:38:37,500 --> 01:38:38,540
Excuse me.

977
01:38:39,410 --> 01:38:40,450
Can I clear the table?

978
01:39:08,910 --> 01:39:10,160
Five minutes, Iram.

979
01:39:17,160 --> 01:39:18,950
I've a flight to catch. Kill
them.

980
01:39:21,120 --> 01:39:23,080
Sir, I will wait in the lobby.
- Okay.

981
01:39:25,290 --> 01:39:26,250
Rajesh.

982
01:39:29,540 --> 01:39:30,790
Sir. Sir.

983
01:39:34,910 --> 01:39:35,620
Sir.

984
01:39:38,700 --> 01:39:39,700
Where is it?

985
01:39:47,620 --> 01:39:49,750
Sorry, sir. I had no option.

986
01:39:49,750 --> 01:39:50,950
How many people outside?

987
01:40:20,750 --> 01:40:25,080
"My life was engulfed in
darkness until you came with a ray of
hope"

988
01:40:25,080 --> 01:40:29,540
"Giving a meaning to my
otherwise futile life"

989
01:40:29,540 --> 01:40:33,910
"I was like a lost ship"

990
01:40:33,910 --> 01:40:38,120
"and I wonder how you
brought me to the shore"

991
01:40:38,120 --> 01:40:46,120
"we have a connection"

992
01:40:46,750 --> 01:40:51,000
"I fail to understand how"

993
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:54,910
"but we do"

994
01:40:55,580 --> 01:40:57,910
"what else is there to say"

995
01:40:57,910 --> 01:41:04,200
"I choose your embrace over
heaven"

996
01:41:04,200 --> 01:41:08,040
"You entered my life
like a beautiful dawn."

997
01:41:08,040 --> 01:41:13,580
"Giving me a reason to live."

998
01:41:39,120 --> 01:41:45,830
"a fleeting moment"

999
01:41:47,790 --> 01:41:55,000
"was generous enough"

1000
01:41:55,000 --> 01:42:03,580
"to bless me with your sight
which was like a guiding star"

1001
01:42:03,580 --> 01:42:12,250
"like a hint from destiny"

1002
01:42:13,160 --> 01:42:17,750
"you pacified my estranged
feelings"

1003
01:42:17,750 --> 01:42:21,660
"breaking the silence with a
debate"

1004
01:42:21,660 --> 01:42:25,950
"I was like a lost ship"

1005
01:42:25,950 --> 01:42:30,290
"and I wonder how you
brought me to the shore"

1006
01:42:30,290 --> 01:42:38,290
"we have a connection"

1007
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:43,160
"I fail to understand how"

1008
01:42:43,160 --> 01:42:47,080
"but we do"

1009
01:42:47,830 --> 01:42:50,080
"what else is there to say"

1010
01:42:50,080 --> 01:42:56,200
"I choose your embrace over
heaven"

1011
01:42:56,200 --> 01:43:00,790
"You entered my life
like a beautiful dawn."

1012
01:43:00,790 --> 01:43:05,410
"Giving me a reason to live."

1013
01:43:47,410 --> 01:43:49,040
Welcome to Somalia.
- Thank you.

1014
01:43:49,040 --> 01:43:50,000
You got anything for me?

1015
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:50,950
Take the plane.

1016
01:44:32,040 --> 01:44:37,580
We welcome you to Karachi,
Pakistan.

1017
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:54,540
Welcome to Pakistan, sir.

1018
01:44:55,330 --> 01:44:57,290
Any special reason to come here?

1019
01:44:57,290 --> 01:44:59,870
Her grandfather died in the
blast.

1020
01:44:59,870 --> 01:45:01,120
If you hurry up...

1021
01:45:01,120 --> 01:45:02,790
...then we can take
part in the final rites.

1022
01:45:03,790 --> 01:45:04,660
Please.

1023
01:45:11,750 --> 01:45:12,580
Thank you.

1024
01:45:13,200 --> 01:45:14,160
Anytime, brother.

1025
01:45:14,580 --> 01:45:15,700
Next please.

1026
01:45:16,410 --> 01:45:17,540
Hello.

1027
01:45:26,830 --> 01:45:29,450
Relax. We are outside the
airport.

1028
01:45:30,660 --> 01:45:31,910
You were fantastic.

1029
01:45:35,750 --> 01:45:37,330
I have returned after 15 years.

1030
01:45:39,450 --> 01:45:42,870
My home was on the next left.

1031
01:45:46,660 --> 01:45:49,120
Sorry to disturb your memories.

1032
01:45:51,620 --> 01:45:52,870
It's a one hour journey.

1033
01:45:55,120 --> 01:45:56,330
You can cry all you want.

1034
01:46:33,790 --> 01:46:35,370
Move, move.

1035
01:46:35,370 --> 01:46:37,410
Move the car.

1036
01:47:01,580 --> 01:47:03,750
Third on the most wanted list.

1037
01:47:04,290 --> 01:47:05,540
Taimoor Pasha.

1038
01:47:19,870 --> 01:47:21,410
How will we get in?

1039
01:47:21,410 --> 01:47:23,410
I was wondering how we will get
out?

1040
01:47:32,660 --> 01:47:34,750
You? Did you recognize me?

1041
01:47:36,080 --> 01:47:38,250
Farah. Farah Faqqesh.

1042
01:47:38,250 --> 01:47:40,830
I know your name isn't Kapil
Dev.

1043
01:47:42,160 --> 01:47:43,330
Iram Bilal.

1044
01:47:44,910 --> 01:47:46,450
Can you get us inside?

1045
01:47:46,450 --> 01:47:47,750
Of course.

1046
01:47:48,250 --> 01:47:49,700
They're with me.

1047
01:47:52,580 --> 01:47:54,500
Come.

1048
01:47:54,830 --> 01:47:56,290
Move on.

1049
01:48:01,660 --> 01:48:03,950
The program's on the 10th floor.

1050
01:48:09,620 --> 01:48:11,450
Can you hide her somewhere?

1051
01:48:11,450 --> 01:48:12,370
By God.

1052
01:48:12,370 --> 01:48:14,330
This beautiful
face isn't for hiding.

1053
01:48:14,330 --> 01:48:17,410
Together we will
steal everyone's heart.

1054
01:48:25,540 --> 01:48:26,410
Hello.

1055
01:48:47,500 --> 01:48:52,620
"He looked at me."

1056
01:48:53,370 --> 01:48:57,580
"And it's made me crazy."

1057
01:48:58,410 --> 01:49:05,450
"Now that he has touched me..."

1058
01:49:06,160 --> 01:49:13,000
"I feel anew."

1059
01:49:15,450 --> 01:49:19,160
"I have many lovers."

1060
01:49:19,160 --> 01:49:22,750
"But if you can win me over."

1061
01:49:22,750 --> 01:49:28,000
"Take my heart for free."

1062
01:49:30,080 --> 01:49:33,790
"The poor souls are so
distressed."

1063
01:49:33,790 --> 01:49:37,330
"But if you can win me over."

1064
01:49:37,330 --> 01:49:42,250
"Take my heart for free."

1065
01:49:44,540 --> 01:49:49,540
"Take my heart for free."

1066
01:49:52,120 --> 01:49:59,500
"Your eyes are so bewitching."

1067
01:49:59,500 --> 01:50:03,750
"They put me in an illusion."

1068
01:50:03,750 --> 01:50:06,700
"You're eyes are so bewitching."

1069
01:50:06,700 --> 01:50:10,330
"They put me in an illusion."

1070
01:50:11,040 --> 01:50:14,950
"There are others
craving for my love."

1071
01:50:14,950 --> 01:50:18,450
"I am a bit nice,
but they are cheats."

1072
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:25,910
"There are others
craving for my love."

1073
01:50:25,910 --> 01:50:29,330
"I am a bit nice,
but they are cheats."

1074
01:50:29,330 --> 01:50:33,040
"My heart's invaluable,
it's not for everyone."

1075
01:50:33,040 --> 01:50:36,000
"But I need to give it
away for your sake."

1076
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:39,580
"The entire market's sold
today."

1077
01:50:39,580 --> 01:50:43,330
"But if you can win me over."

1078
01:50:43,330 --> 01:50:48,200
"Take my heart for free."

1079
01:50:50,580 --> 01:50:54,330
"I have many lovers."

1080
01:50:54,330 --> 01:50:57,950
"But if you can win me over."

1081
01:50:57,950 --> 01:51:02,790
"Take my heart for free."

1082
01:51:30,910 --> 01:51:32,040
Hello.

1083
01:51:35,250 --> 01:51:37,790
I need you to
deliver package to Delhi.

1084
01:51:37,790 --> 01:51:40,290
What is it this time?
- The usual.

1085
01:51:41,290 --> 01:51:42,750
Don't you get bored?

1086
01:51:42,750 --> 01:51:44,290
I am bored.

1087
01:51:49,200 --> 01:51:50,700
A small gift for you.

1088
01:51:53,540 --> 01:51:57,450
"I thought of buying
your heart as well."

1089
01:51:57,450 --> 01:52:01,200
"Name the price, show the
receipt."

1090
01:52:04,580 --> 01:52:08,540
"I thought of buying
your heart as well."

1091
01:52:08,540 --> 01:52:11,790
"Name the price, show the
receipt."

1092
01:52:12,160 --> 01:52:15,370
"Then I can make you
anything you want."

1093
01:52:15,830 --> 01:52:17,370
"You'll have eyes only for me."

1094
01:52:17,370 --> 01:52:19,160
A small gift, for you.

1095
01:52:19,160 --> 01:52:21,580
"You're the only one
I lost my heart to."

1096
01:52:21,580 --> 01:52:25,830
"But if you can win me over."

1097
01:52:25,830 --> 01:52:30,450
"Take my heart for free."

1098
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:34,910
"I have many lovers."

1099
01:52:34,910 --> 01:52:36,330
Listen.

1100
01:52:36,330 --> 01:52:37,080
Look...

1101
01:52:37,080 --> 01:52:39,830
Tomorrow.

1102
01:52:39,830 --> 01:52:40,950
Are you listening? Listen.

1103
01:52:40,950 --> 01:52:43,080
"Take my heart for free."

1104
01:52:43,080 --> 01:52:46,370
Tell Gajja that he'll
receive a box of sweets.

1105
01:52:47,040 --> 01:52:50,250
The delivery should me
made to Blue Bird in Delhi.

1106
01:52:50,700 --> 01:52:52,250
"Take my heart for free."

1107
01:52:52,250 --> 01:52:55,620
Understood. Goodbye.

1108
01:52:59,330 --> 01:53:03,330
"I can't live a moment with
you."

1109
01:53:03,330 --> 01:53:06,540
"I can't live a moment with
you."

1110
01:53:06,540 --> 01:53:10,250
"I can't live a moment with
you."

1111
01:53:10,250 --> 01:53:13,500
"I can't live a moment with
you."

1112
01:53:21,330 --> 01:53:25,120
"I can't live a moment with
you."

1113
01:53:25,120 --> 01:53:28,330
"I can't live a moment with
you."

1114
01:53:33,620 --> 01:53:35,160
What kind of security is this?

1115
01:53:35,790 --> 01:53:37,200
Who is this girl?

1116
01:53:37,540 --> 01:53:39,950
Interpol, Indian government,
who is behind her?

1117
01:53:39,950 --> 01:53:41,620
Find out.
- We will find out.

1118
01:53:48,750 --> 01:53:49,750
Who are you?

1119
01:53:50,870 --> 01:53:52,450
Who do you work for?

1120
01:53:53,750 --> 01:53:55,620
I work for Pakistan.

1121
01:53:56,870 --> 01:53:58,370
Who do you work for?

1122
01:54:10,080 --> 01:54:11,120
This bug... Tell me?

1123
01:54:11,870 --> 01:54:13,250
The longer you take...

1124
01:54:13,250 --> 01:54:14,750
...the more fun it will be for
me

1125
01:54:15,790 --> 01:54:17,040
Don't worry about me.

1126
01:54:17,040 --> 01:54:18,370
I am in my own country.

1127
01:54:19,040 --> 01:54:20,870
You leave. Good bye.

1128
01:54:23,200 --> 01:54:24,580
There's another spy here.

1129
01:54:24,580 --> 01:54:26,040
Find him.

1130
01:54:32,040 --> 01:54:33,580
This is him.

1131
01:54:33,580 --> 01:54:35,040
Listen.. excuse me..

1132
01:54:36,660 --> 01:54:37,580
I am sorry.

1133
01:54:38,250 --> 01:54:39,750
We've found the spy.

1134
01:54:39,750 --> 01:54:40,620
Come on.

1135
01:54:40,620 --> 01:54:42,540
Listen to me.

1136
01:54:43,080 --> 01:54:45,080
Your partner's been caught.

1137
01:54:45,080 --> 01:54:46,250
You are a traitor.

1138
01:54:46,580 --> 01:54:49,330
That's why Gen.
lftekhaar never trusted you.

1139
01:54:49,330 --> 01:54:51,290
I am sure you are
responsible for his death.

1140
01:54:52,200 --> 01:54:53,950
How do you know General
lftekhaar?

1141
01:54:55,750 --> 01:54:58,160
Leave me.

1142
01:54:58,160 --> 01:55:00,200
I haven't done anything.

1143
01:55:00,700 --> 01:55:04,160
What... what is happening here?

1144
01:55:04,160 --> 01:55:05,620
I haven't done anything.

1145
01:55:05,620 --> 01:55:06,750
I swear.

1146
01:55:07,660 --> 01:55:10,290
I was only eating betel leaf.

1147
01:55:10,790 --> 01:55:12,500
Chewing betel leaf is allowed.

1148
01:55:14,160 --> 01:55:15,500
Is he your partner?

1149
01:55:15,790 --> 01:55:17,160
I don't know him.

1150
01:55:17,620 --> 01:55:19,120
I don't know her personally.

1151
01:55:19,120 --> 01:55:21,200
I saw her performing at the
dance

1152
01:55:21,200 --> 01:55:22,120
She was singing.

1153
01:55:22,830 --> 01:55:24,910
I swear... I swear I
haven't done anything.

1154
01:55:24,910 --> 01:55:28,250
I came with the wedding
procession from Rawalpindi.

1155
01:55:28,250 --> 01:55:29,830
And my father..

1156
01:55:30,370 --> 01:55:31,750
Father own a reputed hotel.

1157
01:55:31,750 --> 01:55:36,330
Your days of spying
are over... my friend.

1158
01:55:39,910 --> 01:55:42,540
Every dog has his day.

1159
01:55:43,290 --> 01:55:44,750
What is Blue Bird?

1160
01:55:46,250 --> 01:55:47,450
How dare you ask me questions?

1161
01:55:47,950 --> 01:55:49,290
Have you captured me?

1162
01:55:49,660 --> 01:55:52,580
There's going to be a big
blast in Delhi tomorrow.

1163
01:55:55,790 --> 01:55:57,540
Unfortunately you
won't be there to see it.

1164
01:55:59,700 --> 01:56:01,950
Won't you fulfill my
last wish, Colonel?

1165
01:56:01,950 --> 01:56:04,290
You want a chopper
to get out of here?

1166
01:56:04,290 --> 01:56:05,910
I want a chilled beer.

1167
01:56:06,370 --> 01:56:08,200
I am sure you can arrange for
it.

1168
01:56:11,540 --> 01:56:12,950
Get him a beer.

1169
01:56:13,660 --> 01:56:15,160
But don't give him the bottle.

1170
01:56:15,910 --> 01:56:17,160
Bring it in a paper cup.

1171
01:56:17,160 --> 01:56:18,450
He's very cunning.

1172
01:56:19,200 --> 01:56:20,200
Anything else.

1173
01:56:21,040 --> 01:56:22,370
Juice for you?

1174
01:56:33,750 --> 01:56:34,870
Thank you.

1175
01:57:00,040 --> 01:57:01,410
Will you marry me?

1176
01:57:34,580 --> 01:57:35,500
Where to now?

1177
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:36,830
Delhi.

1178
01:57:37,160 --> 01:57:38,370
We're in Karachi?

1179
01:57:39,120 --> 01:57:41,040
We need to reach
Jahangir point in ten minutes.

1180
01:58:26,620 --> 01:58:27,870
Welcome.

1181
01:58:28,290 --> 01:58:30,160
The pilot says we'll leave at
dawn.

1182
01:58:30,160 --> 01:58:31,540
You'll be in Delhi in two hours.

1183
01:58:31,540 --> 01:58:33,000
All the arrangements have been
done.

1184
01:58:49,910 --> 01:58:51,370
You will have to fly really
low...

1185
01:58:51,370 --> 01:58:53,870
...for the Geiger counter
to detect any radiation.

1186
01:58:59,250 --> 01:59:01,000
But what is wrong? Tell me.

1187
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:02,620
Sorry, sir. I cannot
tell you anything.

1188
01:59:03,040 --> 01:59:04,330
Mr. Nawaz is going to brief you.

1189
01:59:04,330 --> 01:59:05,120
Please come.

1190
01:59:07,910 --> 01:59:09,160
Come, sir.

1191
01:59:17,540 --> 01:59:21,450
You cannot make baseless
allegations against Pakistan.

1192
01:59:21,450 --> 01:59:22,750
Do you have evidence?

1193
01:59:22,750 --> 01:59:24,790
Colonel Huzefa
mentioned 'Blue Bird'.

1194
01:59:26,080 --> 01:59:27,040
What is 'Blue Bird'?

1195
01:59:27,040 --> 01:59:29,330
Colonel Huzefa died
in Karachi yesterday.

1196
01:59:29,750 --> 01:59:31,910
So how can you say
that he's involved?

1197
01:59:31,910 --> 01:59:34,200
I saw him giving orders myself.

1198
01:59:34,790 --> 01:59:36,120
Tehmur Pasha was present there
as well. They spoke about the
bomb

1199
01:59:36,120 --> 01:59:37,540
You shaddup.

1200
01:59:37,950 --> 01:59:40,750
You're betraying your country,
and accusing others.

1201
01:59:40,750 --> 01:59:42,910
The meeting is over.
- No, it's not over.

1202
01:59:43,580 --> 01:59:47,000
If this bomb explodes in Delhi,
there'll be nuclear war.

1203
01:59:47,580 --> 01:59:48,950
We will launch a counter
attack.
In 20 minutes,

1204
01:59:48,950 --> 01:59:50,910
Lahore, Karachi,
Islamabad will be annihilated.

1205
01:59:50,910 --> 01:59:53,080
More than 60 lakh people
will die on both sides.

1206
01:59:53,080 --> 01:59:54,910
If you say
Pakistan isn't involved...

1207
01:59:54,910 --> 01:59:56,750
...then this is
the time to prove it.

1208
01:59:56,750 --> 01:59:57,910
What is Blue Bird?

1209
01:59:57,910 --> 02:00:00,200
Name? Place? What is it?

1210
02:00:00,790 --> 02:00:02,870
Believe me, I don't know.

1211
02:00:04,910 --> 02:00:08,330
Mr. Khan, I can be
court-martialed
for bringing you here.

1212
02:00:08,330 --> 02:00:10,500
But millions can be saved as
well.

1213
02:00:10,950 --> 02:00:11,910
Control room.

1214
02:00:11,910 --> 02:00:13,580
10 geo-stationary satellites.

1215
02:00:13,580 --> 02:00:15,000
And two roaming.

1216
02:00:16,370 --> 02:00:18,500
There are more than 4000
cameras installed in Delhi.

1217
02:00:19,870 --> 02:00:21,450
We can see everything.

1218
02:00:21,450 --> 02:00:24,330
And maybe you can see your
wife in one of these cameras...

1219
02:00:24,330 --> 02:00:27,160
...who just returned home
after dropping your kids to
school.

1220
02:00:27,160 --> 02:00:30,080
There are other mothers,
children,
families who have no idea...

1221
02:00:30,080 --> 02:00:32,370
...that everything will
be over in four hours.

1222
02:00:33,790 --> 02:00:36,080
I believe it, Mr. Khan.
That you don't know.

1223
02:00:36,080 --> 02:00:39,540
But there must be someone in
Pakistan,
in ISI or in your embassy...

1224
02:00:39,540 --> 02:00:43,250
..who knows! Please, find out.

1225
02:01:00,870 --> 02:01:04,700
"These days he never stops
anyone."

1226
02:01:04,700 --> 02:01:08,000
"No matter what you do,
it never interferes."

1227
02:01:08,830 --> 02:01:12,450
"There's loot and plunder
all around, and destruction."

1228
02:01:13,040 --> 02:01:15,500
"God is up above,
and we're on earth."

1229
02:01:15,500 --> 02:01:16,790
Would you like to have tea?

1230
02:01:16,790 --> 02:01:20,790
"These days He pays
less attention to us."

1231
02:01:24,620 --> 02:01:26,080
One world government.

1232
02:01:27,750 --> 02:01:30,410
Look I've never
understood this term.

1233
02:01:31,700 --> 02:01:36,290
We are a small circle of
friends.

1234
02:01:36,290 --> 02:01:41,830
Including top bankers, oil
magnets,
media personalities...

1235
02:01:41,830 --> 02:01:45,700
...political figures, even an
ex-president of the United
States.

1236
02:01:45,700 --> 02:01:46,790
Yes.

1237
02:01:46,790 --> 02:01:50,540
And this group has control over
almost the entire world economy.

1238
02:01:50,540 --> 02:01:53,250
Maybe what you are saying is
right.

1239
02:01:54,160 --> 02:01:56,290
But these immense resources.

1240
02:01:56,290 --> 02:02:00,500
If they are used properly,
then anything is possible.

1241
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:03,870
Governments have their own
agenda.

1242
02:02:03,870 --> 02:02:05,330
Their own programs.

1243
02:02:05,750 --> 02:02:07,450
But at the end of the day...

1244
02:02:07,910 --> 02:02:10,330
...it is the
individual that matters.

1245
02:03:00,370 --> 02:03:02,500
Blue Bird is the
Lashkar's safe house...

1246
02:03:02,500 --> 02:03:04,580
...and Professor
Yusuf Malik's house.

1247
02:03:04,580 --> 02:03:05,750
Ashiana Bungalow.

1248
02:03:05,750 --> 02:03:08,080
Khilji road. Behind Qutub
complex.

1249
02:03:08,080 --> 02:03:09,620
We cannot raid that place, sir.

1250
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:13,370
What if they press the trigger?
- We don't have an option.

1251
02:03:14,410 --> 02:03:15,500
There's one way.

1252
02:03:26,160 --> 02:03:28,290
Professor Malik.
- Yes.

1253
02:03:28,870 --> 02:03:29,790
I am Iram.

1254
02:03:30,290 --> 02:03:31,750
Iram Parveen Bilal.

1255
02:03:32,790 --> 02:03:34,200
I want to meet the Colonel.

1256
02:03:34,200 --> 02:03:35,330
Who?

1257
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:39,330
You've got the wrong address.

1258
02:03:41,450 --> 02:03:42,500
Iram.

1259
02:03:43,080 --> 02:03:45,040
Last year, London bombings.

1260
02:03:45,660 --> 02:03:47,330
Is the Colonel here or not?

1261
02:03:49,500 --> 02:03:51,160
Come in.

1262
02:03:53,040 --> 02:03:54,750
The Colonel didn't
mention anything about you.

1263
02:03:55,750 --> 02:03:56,870
Where is he?

1264
02:03:56,870 --> 02:03:59,660
He's gone to the bus stop.

1265
02:04:00,700 --> 02:04:01,870
Will be back soon.

1266
02:04:04,370 --> 02:04:07,410
How far?
- He'll be back.

1267
02:04:19,910 --> 02:04:21,620
Will you have tea?

1268
02:04:21,620 --> 02:04:22,950
Yes, thank you.

1269
02:04:37,830 --> 02:04:39,200
What is that?

1270
02:05:00,250 --> 02:05:01,910
Locate HOHO bus 6DL 3323.

1271
02:05:01,910 --> 02:05:03,410
Sir, that bus is at Humayun
tomb.

1272
02:05:03,410 --> 02:05:04,500
Next stop is Red Fort.

1273
02:05:04,500 --> 02:05:06,330
Stay at Red Fort, one hour.
- Built in 1638.

1274
02:05:06,660 --> 02:05:08,750
Come, ma'am, take
care of your belongings.

1275
02:05:14,450 --> 02:05:16,120
I am heading towards the bus.

1276
02:05:16,120 --> 02:05:17,160
Are you ok?

1277
02:05:30,830 --> 02:05:33,080
Sit down.

1278
02:05:35,290 --> 02:05:37,040
I am fine, thank you.

1279
02:05:46,450 --> 02:05:48,080
I will get biscuits.

1280
02:05:55,040 --> 02:05:56,830
She's working for
the cops, Professor.

1281
02:05:58,950 --> 02:06:00,410
Kill her.

1282
02:06:00,410 --> 02:06:02,040
And don't disconnect the phone.

1283
02:06:20,950 --> 02:06:22,540
Let it be, I'll do it.
- No.

1284
02:06:37,290 --> 02:06:41,750
"I just spoke to the Colonel,
you traitor"

1285
02:06:43,870 --> 02:06:45,290
Move in. Move in.

1286
02:07:02,910 --> 02:07:03,950
Are you okay?

1287
02:07:08,750 --> 02:07:10,200
He just called the Colonel.

1288
02:07:10,200 --> 02:07:11,500
Triangulate this number.

1289
02:07:11,500 --> 02:07:14,040
9810160605.

1290
02:07:14,910 --> 02:07:17,290
Triangulating 9810160605.

1291
02:07:17,290 --> 02:07:19,250
Sir, this number has
been switched off.

1292
02:07:19,250 --> 02:07:21,200
Near Pari Chowk, Noida.
I am sending a chopper.

1293
02:07:21,200 --> 02:07:23,290
Jimmy, get out of the bus.

1294
02:07:23,290 --> 02:07:25,080
And find your own way to the
target.

1295
02:07:25,540 --> 02:07:27,830
No, don't touch the
timer until I say so.

1296
02:07:29,830 --> 02:07:32,120
"Since Bisleri got popular."

1297
02:07:32,120 --> 02:07:34,330
"Everyone forgot about
wells and handpumps."

1298
02:07:34,330 --> 02:07:36,290
"Since Bisleri got popular."

1299
02:07:36,290 --> 02:07:38,080
"Everyone forgot about
wells and handpumps."

1300
02:07:38,080 --> 02:07:40,160
"Even though farmers
produced food-grains."

1301
02:07:40,160 --> 02:07:42,290
"They had to commit suicide."

1302
02:07:42,660 --> 02:07:44,250
Where to, sir?
- Janpath.

1303
02:07:44,250 --> 02:07:45,620
That will be Rs. 200.

1304
02:07:45,620 --> 02:07:46,830
Let's go.

1305
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:54,910
What's in the bag?
- Nothing.

1306
02:07:54,910 --> 02:07:56,040
Can I see?

1307
02:08:03,500 --> 02:08:05,200
The call's been
triangulated in Noida.

1308
02:08:05,200 --> 02:08:07,410
Cell tower 26 D. come on, move.

1309
02:08:07,410 --> 02:08:09,160
How far is Noida?
- Five minutes.

1310
02:08:10,040 --> 02:08:10,870
Move.

1311
02:08:16,330 --> 02:08:18,160
Move.

1312
02:08:18,160 --> 02:08:19,290
Move.

1313
02:08:21,370 --> 02:08:22,580
Move.

1314
02:08:56,410 --> 02:08:57,580
Hello, sir.

1315
02:08:57,580 --> 02:08:59,200
Yes, I've left the bus.

1316
02:08:59,200 --> 02:09:00,660
Take us to Kinari Bazaar.

1317
02:09:00,660 --> 02:09:02,200
Kinari Bazaar.

1318
02:09:02,870 --> 02:09:04,500
I'm heading straight.
Please get down.

1319
02:09:04,500 --> 02:09:06,700
We've sat down now. Let's go.

1320
02:09:08,580 --> 02:09:10,620
It's a smart dress.

1321
02:09:10,620 --> 02:09:12,040
But it makes me look fat.

1322
02:09:12,040 --> 02:09:14,000
I am going to wear a sari.
I look smart in a sari...

1323
02:09:17,250 --> 02:09:19,290
I think this guy is
taking us for a ride.

1324
02:09:19,290 --> 02:09:20,910
Where are you going?

1325
02:09:20,910 --> 02:09:22,120
Turn around.

1326
02:09:22,120 --> 02:09:23,540
Take a U-turn.

1327
02:09:23,540 --> 02:09:24,500
Can't you hear?

1328
02:09:24,500 --> 02:09:25,410
Are you deaf?

1329
02:09:25,410 --> 02:09:28,120
Get down at the signal.
- Why should we get down?

1330
02:09:28,120 --> 02:09:30,120
I'll make the
inspector teach you a lesson.

1331
02:09:30,120 --> 02:09:31,580
Look, sir. He's really...

1332
02:09:31,580 --> 02:09:32,580
Get down.

1333
02:09:32,580 --> 02:09:34,250
What's wrong? Why are you
screaming?

1334
02:09:34,870 --> 02:09:37,410
What is wrong?

1335
02:09:52,370 --> 02:09:53,660
He has the bomb.

1336
02:09:53,660 --> 02:09:55,200
Don't give him a
chance to press the trigger.

1337
02:09:55,200 --> 02:09:56,500
Shoot only if you get a
headshot.

1338
02:09:56,500 --> 02:09:57,580
Only if you get a headshot.

1339
02:09:57,580 --> 02:09:59,660
Not receiving Cam
56 from Barakhambha.

1340
02:09:59,660 --> 02:10:00,870
Cam 3 zoom in.

1341
02:10:00,870 --> 02:10:02,000
Stay.

1342
02:10:05,160 --> 02:10:07,580
And there are passengers.
- He's taken the ITO flyover.

1343
02:10:07,580 --> 02:10:09,250
He's entered the one way
from the opposite side.

1344
02:10:11,580 --> 02:10:13,700
Why aren't you listening?

1345
02:10:59,500 --> 02:11:01,000
Oh, God!

1346
02:11:14,250 --> 02:11:16,080
We are checking the area
around the cell tower, sir.

1347
02:11:16,080 --> 02:11:17,540
The mobile phone is switched
off.

1348
02:11:17,540 --> 02:11:18,620
Frankly he can be anywhere.

1349
02:11:18,620 --> 02:11:21,620
Sir Metla is here
for a charity program.

1350
02:11:21,620 --> 02:11:23,700
Lovely to meet you.

1351
02:11:23,700 --> 02:11:25,080
Yes, certainly.

1352
02:11:25,370 --> 02:11:27,080
Dr. Ruby.
- Sir Metla.

1353
02:11:27,080 --> 02:11:28,790
What are you doing here?

1354
02:11:29,370 --> 02:11:31,290
You are here for a charity
function.

1355
02:11:31,290 --> 02:11:34,040
I don't do charity.
I do investments.

1356
02:11:35,410 --> 02:11:36,500
We're getting late.

1357
02:11:36,500 --> 02:11:37,790
Good, sir. Good.

1358
02:11:37,790 --> 02:11:39,200
Nice seeing you.

1359
02:11:44,950 --> 02:11:47,580
Move it. Clear the traffic.
Move them.

1360
02:11:47,580 --> 02:11:48,830
They found a dead cabbie
near the cell tower...

1361
02:11:48,830 --> 02:11:50,750
...there's definitely a
connection.

1362
02:11:50,750 --> 02:11:51,910
Call the dog squad.

1363
02:13:08,910 --> 02:13:11,830
Move. Move. Move.

1364
02:13:44,040 --> 02:13:45,040
I lost him.

1365
02:13:57,120 --> 02:13:58,370
Iram, come in.

1366
02:13:59,160 --> 02:14:00,330
Iram, come in. Iram, come in.

1367
02:14:11,120 --> 02:14:13,120
Thank you for your hospitality.

1368
02:14:13,120 --> 02:14:15,910
Is there a scheduled time
for the helicopter to leave?

1369
02:14:15,910 --> 02:14:18,700
We should go now. It's
really getting late now.

1370
02:14:19,080 --> 02:14:20,290
There was a technical problem,
sir.

1371
02:14:20,290 --> 02:14:22,040
It's been solved. But we
should leave immediately.

1372
02:14:22,040 --> 02:14:23,450
Okay, let's go.

1373
02:14:26,660 --> 02:14:27,660
I will think about it.

1374
02:14:32,750 --> 02:14:34,620
The pilot is the Colonel.

1375
02:14:45,580 --> 02:14:46,540
Get in.

1376
02:14:46,540 --> 02:14:47,540
Get in.

1377
02:14:49,330 --> 02:14:50,370
Stop.

1378
02:14:51,290 --> 02:14:54,660
My glasses.

1379
02:14:54,660 --> 02:14:56,830
I need my glasses.

1380
02:14:57,500 --> 02:14:59,370
Please, my glasses.

1381
02:15:04,950 --> 02:15:06,250
Rascal.

1382
02:15:23,620 --> 02:15:26,500
Colonel, I am in an ice-cream
parlor at Connaught Place.

1383
02:15:26,500 --> 02:15:27,660
Nirula's.

1384
02:15:27,660 --> 02:15:30,080
Only nine minutes left.

1385
02:15:53,870 --> 02:15:58,000
Happy birthday to you.

1386
02:16:43,540 --> 02:16:44,870
Everybody out.

1387
02:16:45,290 --> 02:16:47,910
Get out, come on.

1388
02:16:49,830 --> 02:16:51,700
Everybody out.

1389
02:16:51,700 --> 02:16:53,200
Everybody out.

1390
02:16:54,700 --> 02:16:56,450
Go, go, go.

1391
02:16:57,290 --> 02:16:59,950
Everybody out.

1392
02:17:00,290 --> 02:17:02,410
Everybody out.

1393
02:17:13,830 --> 02:17:15,120
Darn it.

1394
02:17:16,040 --> 02:17:18,160
Sir. I have found the bomb.

1395
02:17:18,160 --> 02:17:19,250
It's demanding a password.

1396
02:17:19,250 --> 02:17:21,330
Run, run. Vacate the place.

1397
02:17:37,580 --> 02:17:40,080
Hurry up.

1398
02:17:40,080 --> 02:17:42,080
Come on, come on, come on
everybody.

1399
02:17:55,120 --> 02:17:56,750
The firing circuit
has completely failed.

1400
02:17:56,750 --> 02:17:57,950
I will have to open it
completely.

1401
02:17:57,950 --> 02:17:59,580
Open it.
- That will take time.

1402
02:17:59,580 --> 02:18:01,290
At least 15-20 minutes.

1403
02:18:11,120 --> 02:18:12,200
Get out.

1404
02:18:28,410 --> 02:18:31,160
Ground all choppers,
sir. Only four minutes left.

1405
02:18:31,160 --> 02:18:32,330
Waiting for coordinates.

1406
02:18:32,330 --> 02:18:34,120
Get me the map for outer Delhi.

1407
02:18:35,500 --> 02:18:38,500
Fly north by north east, Radial
045.

1408
02:18:38,500 --> 02:18:39,910
Fly high for the first two
minutes.

1409
02:18:39,910 --> 02:18:41,500
Then at 500 feet
for the last minute.

1410
02:18:41,500 --> 02:18:43,040
Setting course, north by north
east.

1411
02:18:43,040 --> 02:18:44,580
Radial 045.

1412
02:18:47,330 --> 02:18:50,540
You'll see an old copper mine.

1413
02:18:50,540 --> 02:18:52,580
The mine is 2000 feet deep

1414
02:18:52,580 --> 02:18:54,660
Crash the bomb in the mine.
- Roger that, sir.

1415
02:19:13,790 --> 02:19:16,500
It was a privilege
serving with you, my boy.

1416
02:19:16,500 --> 02:19:17,790
Jai Hind, sir.

1417
02:19:18,410 --> 02:19:20,000
Requesting personal time.

1418
02:19:20,660 --> 02:19:22,370
Connect me to Iram, sir.

1419
02:19:26,700 --> 02:19:29,040
She is in no stage to be moved.

1420
02:19:29,040 --> 02:19:30,910
She's losing too much blood.

1421
02:19:32,870 --> 02:19:34,080
Iram.

1422
02:19:34,080 --> 02:19:35,870
Iram.

1423
02:19:35,870 --> 02:19:37,370
Iram, it's Vinod.

1424
02:19:37,370 --> 02:19:40,370
Iram.
- Is everything okay?

1425
02:19:40,370 --> 02:19:41,910
Under control.

1426
02:19:41,910 --> 02:19:44,580
Are you fine?
- I am not going to make it,
Vinod.

1427
02:19:45,750 --> 02:19:46,750
What happened?

1428
02:19:46,750 --> 02:19:49,750
That bastard shot me.
- Where are you hit?

1429
02:19:50,250 --> 02:19:52,580
How bad is it?
- Two bullets on the liver.

1430
02:19:53,500 --> 02:19:55,290
I've lost lot of blood.

1431
02:19:55,290 --> 02:19:58,580
Can you come here? Please.

1432
02:20:01,200 --> 02:20:03,540
Can you come here?

1433
02:20:05,080 --> 02:20:07,750
I am in the helicopter,
with the bomb.

1434
02:20:08,700 --> 02:20:10,910
Trying to take it as far
away from the city as possible.

1435
02:20:12,620 --> 02:20:14,000
Why...

1436
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:15,700
Why can't we diffuse the bomb?

1437
02:20:15,700 --> 02:20:17,750
It's asking for the password,
which I don't have.

1438
02:20:22,120 --> 02:20:23,410
Listen to me, Iram.

1439
02:20:24,410 --> 02:20:25,910
I had decided...

1440
02:20:25,910 --> 02:20:29,450
...that I would try and
give you the life you wanted.

1441
02:20:32,870 --> 02:20:35,790
I just want you to know
that I had decided that.

1442
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:41,330
If there is something
on the other side...

1443
02:20:42,080 --> 02:20:43,370
Then we'll meet soon.

1444
02:20:48,330 --> 02:20:49,870
Just one minute left.

1445
02:20:50,950 --> 02:20:52,160
Say something terrific.

1446
02:20:57,330 --> 02:20:58,700
Stay with me.

1447
02:20:58,700 --> 02:20:59,790
She's bleeding.

1448
02:20:59,790 --> 02:21:00,750
Iram.

1449
02:21:02,370 --> 02:21:03,870
Press it. Press it.

1450
02:21:06,290 --> 02:21:07,290
Password.

1451
02:21:11,450 --> 02:21:14,950
Kazan set it in Morocco.

1452
02:21:14,950 --> 02:21:16,120
Kazan?

1453
02:21:16,120 --> 02:21:17,620
Do you know the password?

1454
02:21:18,290 --> 02:21:19,540
Do you know his mother's name?

1455
02:21:19,540 --> 02:21:23,660
He killed her himself.
- What?

1456
02:21:23,660 --> 02:21:26,000
Who?
- Zilleh.

1457
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:27,200
Zilleh?

1458
02:21:27,200 --> 02:21:28,700
Zilleh. Zilleh.

1459
02:21:29,200 --> 02:21:30,080
Who's Zilleh?

1460
02:21:30,620 --> 02:21:32,540
Iram. Iram.

1461
02:21:32,870 --> 02:21:34,410
His pet camel

1462
02:21:35,450 --> 02:21:36,700
Her name was Zilleh.

1463
02:21:37,160 --> 02:21:38,250
Spell it.

1464
02:21:38,250 --> 02:21:39,540
Can you spell it?

1465
02:21:39,540 --> 02:21:41,950
Z I L L...

1466
02:21:43,620 --> 02:21:46,660
Iram.
- E H.

1467
02:21:55,950 --> 02:21:56,910
We did it.

1468
02:22:01,950 --> 02:22:03,500
We made it, baby.

1469
02:22:26,830 --> 02:22:28,700
Complete the formalities. We
will fly her body to Pakistan

1470
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:53,950
You wanted a world...

1471
02:22:56,160 --> 02:22:58,410
...where this Rubaiyat
is just a book of poems.

1472
02:23:05,910 --> 02:23:08,160
Maybe you are in such a world
now.

1473
02:23:37,250 --> 02:23:39,330
We found this on the Colonel's
body.

1474
02:23:40,370 --> 02:23:42,290
Possibly his insurance policy.

1475
02:23:43,290 --> 02:23:44,450
Check it.

1476
02:23:49,080 --> 02:23:52,500
We cannot touch this man.

1477
02:23:53,410 --> 02:23:55,950
He's beyond our reach.

1478
02:23:57,500 --> 02:24:01,660
And its impossible to
prove anything in court.

1479
02:24:03,910 --> 02:24:05,830
If anything happens to him.

1480
02:24:06,580 --> 02:24:09,000
An accident or...

1481
02:24:12,870 --> 02:24:13,750
Cheers.

1482
02:24:22,160 --> 02:24:24,500
In the last 48 hours
Pakistan's army has raided..

1483
02:24:24,500 --> 02:24:27,950
..training camps and many
sleeper cells of Lashkar.

1484
02:24:28,370 --> 02:24:31,540
And more than 200
operatives have been killed..

1485
02:24:31,540 --> 02:24:33,700
..and around 600 have been
arrested.

1486
02:24:34,200 --> 02:24:35,870
These raids have..

1487
02:24:35,870 --> 02:24:37,700
..served a harsh blow to many
terrorist organizations like
Lashkar.

1488
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:45,830
Sayyad, don't ask who I am.

1489
02:24:46,700 --> 02:24:47,950
Just listen carefully.

1490
02:24:48,540 --> 02:24:52,160
I know who's behind the
incident that took place in
Delhi.

1491
02:25:05,160 --> 02:25:07,950
Freddie Khambatta.
- Agent Vinod, sir.

1492
02:25:08,870 --> 02:25:10,410
I would like to show you
something.

1493
02:25:14,160 --> 02:25:17,200
Am I making myself clear?
- Yes.

1494
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:21,250
Lashkar is the most
active group these days.

1495
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:23,250
Yes.

1496
02:25:24,290 --> 02:25:27,250
The Zeus group
doesn't want any publicity.

1497
02:25:29,040 --> 02:25:31,200
No comebacks.

1498
02:25:34,950 --> 02:25:36,870
I will cover my footsteps.

1499
02:25:36,870 --> 02:25:39,750
But what's the guarantee
that you will spare me...

1500
02:25:39,750 --> 02:25:41,750
...after the job's done?

1501
02:25:41,750 --> 02:25:46,080
There'll be 25
million Euros in your bank.

1502
02:25:46,950 --> 02:25:48,500
You take care of that.

1503
02:25:49,450 --> 02:25:51,290
And let us take care of the
world.

1504
02:25:51,870 --> 02:25:53,620
Cheers.
- Cheers.

1505
02:26:02,450 --> 02:26:03,870
What is this?

1506
02:26:04,450 --> 02:26:06,620
Why are you showing this to me?

1507
02:26:07,200 --> 02:26:11,290
My granddaughter shows
me such videos on Youtube.

1508
02:26:11,910 --> 02:26:13,160
Smart idea.

1509
02:26:14,370 --> 02:26:16,160
You would've
exploded the bomb in Delhi.

1510
02:26:16,700 --> 02:26:18,040
And the world would've
thought...

1511
02:26:18,040 --> 02:26:19,950
...that a group like
Lashkar is behind it.

1512
02:26:20,910 --> 02:26:25,000
So Colonel used people like
Abu,
Kazan, Jimmy and Huzefa.

1513
02:26:25,750 --> 02:26:28,000
Put the stamp of
Jehad on the operation.

1514
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:30,370
You wanted to trigger a
war between both countries...

1515
02:26:30,370 --> 02:26:31,870
...and make millions.

1516
02:26:32,580 --> 02:26:35,410
Fascinating theory, Agent Vinod.

1517
02:26:36,120 --> 02:26:37,660
But why did you get this here?

1518
02:26:37,660 --> 02:26:39,120
Take it to the press.

1519
02:26:39,120 --> 02:26:41,330
It'll be fun for a few days.

1520
02:26:41,330 --> 02:26:43,660
But now you must excuse me.

1521
02:26:43,660 --> 02:26:48,370
I need to... attend a function.

1522
02:26:56,290 --> 02:26:57,950
The Zeus group.

1523
02:26:58,750 --> 02:27:01,120
Great businessmen like you.

1524
02:27:03,160 --> 02:27:06,120
Senators, ex-prime ministers.

1525
02:27:06,120 --> 02:27:07,910
I've heard that whenever you
meet...

1526
02:27:07,910 --> 02:27:10,580
...something strange
occurs somewhere in the world.

1527
02:27:10,580 --> 02:27:12,450
Some President's
death in a plane crash.

1528
02:27:12,450 --> 02:27:14,790
A civil war in a small country.

1529
02:27:15,500 --> 02:27:17,200
Nuclear blast in New Delhi.

1530
02:27:18,700 --> 02:27:20,000
Wow.

1531
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:22,160
Wow, Agent Vinod.

1532
02:27:23,120 --> 02:27:24,410
Wow.

1533
02:27:27,330 --> 02:27:29,790
You think you know everything.

1534
02:27:30,410 --> 02:27:33,500
But I want to add to your
knowledge.

1535
02:27:33,500 --> 02:27:35,620
A bomb blasts in Delhi.

1536
02:27:35,620 --> 02:27:38,830
But the real explosion happens
in the stock exchanges of New
York...

1537
02:27:38,830 --> 02:27:42,410
...London, Tokyo,
Hong Kong, Beijing

1538
02:27:42,410 --> 02:27:44,870
You would short stocks
and make your billions.

1539
02:27:45,750 --> 02:27:48,000
But what about the millions
that die in both the countries?

1540
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:49,330
What about them?

1541
02:27:52,580 --> 02:27:54,410
You know what would've
happened to China...

1542
02:27:54,410 --> 02:27:56,410
...if the stock market had
crashed?

1543
02:27:57,080 --> 02:28:01,330
How NATO would've seized
Pakistan's nuclear bombs?

1544
02:28:01,330 --> 02:28:04,870
And we could have solved
the Iran pipeline situation

1545
02:28:05,540 --> 02:28:07,620
These are complex issues.

1546
02:28:07,620 --> 02:28:10,000
You are a police officer.

1547
02:28:10,540 --> 02:28:12,790
It's beyond your understanding.

1548
02:28:16,620 --> 02:28:18,500
You will have to die. Sir Metla.

1549
02:28:20,950 --> 02:28:22,290
Today.

1550
02:28:23,870 --> 02:28:25,870
You're here to kill me.

1551
02:28:25,870 --> 02:28:27,790
I won't kill you, sir.

1552
02:28:28,790 --> 02:28:30,700
You're a hero in my country.

1553
02:28:31,870 --> 02:28:33,580
And you'll die as a hero.

1554
02:28:36,080 --> 02:28:38,040
There'll be roads
built in your name.

1555
02:28:38,790 --> 02:28:40,120
Stamps issued.

1556
02:28:41,250 --> 02:28:43,250
Books written about you...

1557
02:28:45,830 --> 02:28:47,040
Goodbye, sir.

1558
02:29:01,160 --> 02:29:03,160
Sir Metla will be back soon.

1559
02:29:03,160 --> 02:29:05,500
Won't you sit down, sir?

1560
02:29:12,370 --> 02:29:13,580
Coffee, please.

1561
02:29:25,870 --> 02:29:26,700
What's he doing?

1562
02:29:26,700 --> 02:29:28,330
Second cup of coffee, sir.

1563
02:30:06,410 --> 02:30:07,620
Sir Metla.

1564
02:30:09,410 --> 02:30:11,250
Sayeed Kousar has sent his
regards.

1565
02:30:11,950 --> 02:30:13,700
Who?
- Lashkar, sir.

1566
02:30:20,450 --> 02:30:21,580
Bismillah.

1567
02:30:27,370 --> 02:30:30,700
Our news desk has confirmed
that sir Jagdeshwar Metla has...

1568
02:30:30,700 --> 02:30:32,290
...been assassinated
in what appears...

1569
02:30:32,290 --> 02:30:34,700
...to be a suicide
bombing in central London.

1570
02:30:34,700 --> 02:30:36,620
Sir Metla was on his
way to a felicitation...

1571
02:30:36,620 --> 02:30:38,950
...by the Indo British
chamber of commerce.

1572
02:30:38,950 --> 02:30:40,910
Initial reports state
that Sir Metla had been...

1573
02:30:40,910 --> 02:30:44,580
...seen talking to a south
Asian man seconds before the
explosion.

1574
02:30:44,580 --> 02:30:47,540
It appears that Sir Metla was
killed by the same terror
group...

1575
02:30:47,540 --> 02:30:50,370
...that planned a
nuclear attack in New Delhi.

1576
02:30:50,370 --> 02:30:52,790
It was Sir Metla's
heroic intervention that...

1577
02:30:52,790 --> 02:30:54,330
...thwarted the well laid plan.

1578
02:30:54,330 --> 02:30:56,950
Our correspondent Marge
Atkins is at the site.

1579
02:30:56,950 --> 02:30:59,330
Tell us what is happening
Marge...

1580
02:31:33,500 --> 02:31:35,040
I know you.

1581
02:31:35,620 --> 02:31:38,080
You are Freddie Khambatta.

1582
02:31:38,540 --> 02:31:40,000
I don't like that name.

1583
02:31:40,410 --> 02:31:41,950
So what is your name?

1584
02:32:39,080 --> 02:32:41,080
"The bungalow's locked."

1585
02:32:41,080 --> 02:32:42,950
"How do I get in?"

1586
02:32:42,950 --> 02:32:44,700
"Laila's window is open."

1587
02:32:45,040 --> 02:32:46,910
"There's a gutter below it."

1588
02:32:46,910 --> 02:32:48,790
"Someone's at the window."

1589
02:32:48,790 --> 02:32:50,750
"Laila's having an affair."

1590
02:32:50,750 --> 02:32:54,290
"She has a blast at
the expense of my love."

1591
02:32:54,290 --> 02:32:57,950
"My darling, after I
am smitten by you."

1592
02:32:57,950 --> 02:33:01,910
"Where are you going
blowing away my love?"

1593
02:33:01,910 --> 02:33:05,450
"My darling, after I
am smitten by you."

1594
02:33:05,450 --> 02:33:09,250
"Where are you going
blowing away my love?"

1595
02:33:09,250 --> 02:33:13,330
"My darling, after I
am smitten by you."

1596
02:33:13,330 --> 02:33:17,290
"Where are you going
blowing away my love?"

1597
02:33:48,370 --> 02:33:50,080
"She showers her love on
everyone."

1598
02:33:50,500 --> 02:33:51,950
"But scolds me when I ask for
some."

1599
02:33:52,410 --> 02:33:53,910
"Kisses for everyone else."

1600
02:33:54,290 --> 02:33:56,080
"But just a pat on my cheek."

1601
02:33:56,080 --> 02:33:57,910
"Laila is like a chameleon."

1602
02:33:57,910 --> 02:33:59,870
"Like the beats on the drums."

1603
02:33:59,870 --> 02:34:03,330
"Leaves her lipstick mark on
the cheeks with her smooch."

1604
02:34:03,330 --> 02:34:05,200
"My.."

1605
02:34:05,200 --> 02:34:07,200
"My...my.."

1606
02:34:07,200 --> 02:34:10,910
"My...after I am smitten by
you."

1607
02:34:10,910 --> 02:34:14,700
"Where are you going...my love?"

1608
02:34:14,700 --> 02:34:18,700
"My darling, after I
am smitten by you."

1609
02:34:18,700 --> 02:34:22,540
"Where are you going
blowing away my love?"

1610
02:34:22,540 --> 02:34:26,200
