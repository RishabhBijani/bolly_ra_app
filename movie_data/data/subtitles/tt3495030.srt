begging on the roads.

[camera clicks]

172
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,962
Told you so many times,
not to drink milk after having chowmein.

173
00:11:52,087 --> 00:11:53,171
Now he's throwing up.

174
00:11:53,422 --> 00:11:54,714
- He has eaten <i>dahi-bhalla</i>.
- What?

175
00:11:56,091 --> 00:11:58,677
Relax, father, it's nothing.
This is because of allopathy!

176
00:11:58,802 --> 00:12:00,554
You should have seen him popping pills.

177
00:12:00,804 --> 00:12:02,139
He could not refuse the pills.

178
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:03,432
Do it properly.

179
00:12:05,434 --> 00:12:07,227
Give him Limca, he'll be fine.

180
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:10,772
Oh dear!

181
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:13,942
Let him throw up.

182
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:17,696
Sister, I like the this smell
of marigold so much.

183
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:18,989
Hello!

184
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:20,532
Come in, dear.

185
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:21,658
Come, come.

186
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:22,993
See, how pretty it is!

187
00:12:23,869 --> 00:12:25,704
Your aunt has done
all the decorations herself.

188
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:27,247
She got flowers herself.

189
00:12:27,456 --> 00:12:29,207
- Give my nephew so much love...
- [sneezing]

190
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:30,333
Oh, dear, you sneezed.

191
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:35,380
- You have cold?
- I am allergic to marigold.

192
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:40,719
Ok, then let it be like this for tonight
and we shall remove them tomorrow.

193
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:41,928
Come on in now.

194
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:44,055
She has decorated with lots of love.

195
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:45,724
- Let's all go now.
- You can check these.

197
00:12:49,186 --> 00:12:50,312

00:12:58,236 --> 00:12:59,571
[Chandrabhan] Where's the girl?

200
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:05,410
Don't make any mistake in hurry.

201
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:10,582
Let her get a government job first
and then have kids. Got it?

202
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:13,502
Are you feeling fine?

203

Where is the bathroom?

207
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:13,645
You can change here only.

208
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,021
All right.

209
00:14:16,398 --> 00:14:17,732
Wait! I shall go out.

[Sashi] Dear!

218
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:13,848
[Sashi] Are you up, Sandhya?

219
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:15,850
- Yes!
- There is call for you.

220
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:17,060
Ok, mother.

223
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:44,921
- Hello!
- [Girl] <i>Hello.</i>

224
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:46,965
[Girl] <i>Hope I didn't disturb you.</i>

225
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:48,800
How did you get this number?

226
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:52,178
[Girl] Leave all that!
How was your first night?

227
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:56,015
<i>Poor thing! He was behaving
like a calf</i>

[laughing]

230
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:03,732
We both slept on either
sides of the bed.

231
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,234
- Ok, listen, I shall call back later.
- [Girl] <i>Yes.</i>

232
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:07,944
- Ok. Bye!
- [Girl] But please call me...

[Sashi] <i>Why're you muttering?</i>

236
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:24,919
[Sashi] You know sound travels.

237
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:28,131
You are worried about the sound,
but you're not bothered by him.

238
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,717
It's not entirely his fault.

239
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:33,011
She could have spoke to him.

240
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:35,430
[Naina] That's right!
She is also egoistic.

241
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,932
She thinks she has done us great
favour by doing B.Ed.

242
00:17:38,141 --> 00:17:40,685
She didn't even respond to my 'hello'.

243
00:17:41,019 --> 00:17:42,270
And with her family members...

244
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:43,730
[giggling]

245
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:44,939
Well, she is right.

246
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:47,192
We are not at par with her standards.

247
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:50,236
Why are you all blaming that poor girl?

248
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,864
Think about her,
this is a new place for her.

249
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:55,867
And her husband is so rude.
He refuses to talk to her.

250
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:57,160
Boys like him should be...

251
00:17:57,285 --> 00:17:58,870
Let me just teach him a lesson.

252
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,624
Oh! Good morning, dear bridegroom.

253
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:04,417
Where are you off to?

254
00:18:04,501 --> 00:18:05,627
Going to Saakha.

255
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:08,296
Shakha! This will ruin you one day.

256
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:11,633
Want to become a revolutionary!
Can't even kill a fly.

257
00:18:12,217 --> 00:18:13,510
Will talk to you once I am back.

258
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:16,679
Wait a minute. Will talk for sure.
Just look here!

259
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:18,723
Look here!

260
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:20,433
What happened at night?

261
00:18:21,351 --> 00:18:22,727
Dad, hit me if you want to.

262
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:25,104
- But I'll do whatever I want.
- Whatever you want!

263
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:27,941
One hit with my slipper
and you'll start speaking sense.

264
00:18:28,233 --> 00:18:30,652
- Where the hell is my slipper?
- Don't hit him.

265
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:32,320
Stay blessed.

266
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:35,824
See, bride has got tea.
Please serve it to brother-in-law.

267
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:37,242
[Sashi] Come, well done.

268
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:39,536
He loves going to Shakha.

269
00:18:40,203 --> 00:18:42,121
He loves to exercise since childhood.

270
00:18:42,372 --> 00:18:44,833
Seems you people don't
believe in exercising.

271
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:47,126
Just father goes to exercise.

272
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:48,753
I practice yoga at home.

273
00:18:49,838 --> 00:18:51,881
Yeah! I can see that.

Remember Bhagat Singh,

Neta Ji Subhash Chandra Bose, Shivaji

278
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:21,411
and Mr. Vajpayee.

279
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:24,080
Is anyone of these great souls

280
00:19:24,414 --> 00:19:26,124
- directionless?
- [everyone] No!

281
00:19:26,457 --> 00:19:28,668
So, let's take an oath

282
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,713
that we'll take inspiration
from their lives

283
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:35,049
- and follow their footsteps.
- [everyone] Absolutely.

284
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:36,676
- Shakha sir.
- Yes!

285
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:38,094
Prem got married.

286
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,387
[everyone] Congratulations!

287
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:40,847
We all deserve a party!

288
00:19:40,972 --> 00:19:42,015
[everyone] Absolutely.

289
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:44,517
Father has told me not to
waste money on useless friends.

290
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:48,021
We condemn these kinds of useless feasts.

291
00:19:48,396 --> 00:19:49,397
[Prem] Absolutely!

292
00:19:51,608 --> 00:19:52,609
Study hard, Ok?

293
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:53,693
Ok, let's go.

294
00:19:54,569 --> 00:19:55,737
Oh! take this.

295
00:19:55,904 --> 00:19:57,030
- Give it to Jaya.
- Yes.

296
00:19:57,739 --> 00:20:00,325
- Take care of my brother.
- Ok, sister!

297
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:02,994
- Give me ring as soon as you reach home.
- Ok, mother.

298
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:04,120
And you give two rings.

299
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:05,288
Ok, now go!

300
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:07,081
- Take care and go carefully.
- [Hema] Ok!

301
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:10,376
Shakha sir, I don't know what to do.

[all doing breathing exercise]

303
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:14,047
[Shakha] What's the matter?

304
00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:15,590
What's stopping you?

305
00:20:16,299 --> 00:20:17,926
I couldn't even clear 10th grade,

306
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:20,845
and the computer course is in English

307
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,555
which I don't understand.

308
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,350
On top of that, dad has
gotten me married!

309
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:28,394
You're suggesting me to run away
whilst doing yoga.

[breathing exercise continues]

311
00:20:32,315 --> 00:20:34,025
One can't settle in a day, mom.

312
00:20:34,192 --> 00:20:35,360
It'll take some time.

313
00:20:35,944 --> 00:20:37,862
Today, I got up a little late.

<i>What could've I done?</i>

316
00:20:41,199 --> 00:20:43,534
You didn't do anything
and got up late as well.

317
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:47,246
If you continue this,
your in-laws will send you back.

318
00:20:47,372 --> 00:20:50,291
Mridula just can't keep a secret!

God has given you such great opportunity.

323
00:20:58,675 --> 00:21:00,885
You have been married into a family
having tape-cassettes business.

324
00:21:00,969 --> 00:21:03,388
At night, tell him
to put an English movie.

325
00:21:03,638 --> 00:21:06,599
<i>That'll set the mood right!</i>

326

[water splashing]

327
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:10,937
You should revolt.

328
00:21:11,562 --> 00:21:14,399
And continue doing so
till you see things clearly.

329
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:16,234
You are right!

330
00:21:16,693 --> 00:21:18,778
At least I can revolt in bed
if not in the house.

331
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:20,989
Who is watching me there!

332
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:22,991
If he doesn't make the first move,

333
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:24,283
you seduce him!

334
00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:27,036
You're equally responsible
for your marriage, isn't it?

335
00:21:28,746 --> 00:21:30,623
Oh! Please walk slowly.

336
00:21:34,836 --> 00:21:37,422
I cleared engineering, so father asked me
to distribute sweets.

337
00:21:37,672 --> 00:21:38,673
Oh, Prem, listen!

338
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:40,675
First shop from right!

339
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:43,428
- You go, I've some work.
- You'll not come to Vijay's shop?

340
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:46,514
I've to give to everyone. Take less.
Ok, I'll give to aunt!

341
00:21:46,973 --> 00:21:48,933
- [Nirmal] Prem!
- You know Vijay, right?

342
00:21:49,434 --> 00:21:50,935
So what'll I do in a women's shop?

343
00:21:51,144 --> 00:21:52,729
- You go, I'll join.
- Oh, listen!

- Hello, sister!

00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:00,778
See, sister, Prem's wife is here!

347
00:22:00,903 --> 00:22:02,530
- Hello!
- Would you like a cup of tea?

348
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:04,407
No, please, it's fine.

349
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:06,909
Sister, Prem hasn't come?

350
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:08,786
No. He had some work.

351
00:22:09,746 --> 00:22:11,956
- Brother, I need some stuff.
- Yes, of course.

352
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:13,916
These bangles will look lovely on you.

353
00:22:14,042 --> 00:22:15,209
No, I don't want bangles.

354
00:22:15,293 --> 00:22:16,419
I want something like that.

355
00:22:20,715 --> 00:22:21,758
Here, take this, sister.

356
00:22:21,966 --> 00:22:24,010
- These are very nice <i>bindis</i>.
- No, no.

357
00:22:24,469 --> 00:22:25,470
One that's on the side.

358
00:22:29,182 --> 00:22:30,391
This one, sister?

359
00:22:30,641 --> 00:22:31,642
Like that top one!

360
00:22:33,061 --> 00:22:34,604
Sister, can you please show?

361
00:22:34,896 --> 00:22:37,440
- Sister, I have to attend to accounts!
- Okay. That's fine.

362
00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:39,567
What shall I show, sister?

363
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,028
I want satin nightwear.

364
00:22:42,153 --> 00:22:44,113
[Woman] Sure. You would like to see
undergarments also?

365
00:22:44,197 --> 00:22:45,198
No, just that!

366
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:46,741
- [Woman] Nightwear!
- Yes.

367
00:22:49,452 --> 00:22:51,412
[Woman] This'll look nice on you.

368
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,665
- See this.
- Ok, ok, fine.

369
00:22:54,832 --> 00:22:57,043
[Woman] And this one too!
That's its inner wear.

370
00:22:57,293 --> 00:22:58,503
- [Woman] Look!
- Pack it!

371
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:00,088
- [Woman] Yes?
- [Sandhya] Yes.

372
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:06,302
[sad music]

373
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:16,646
Let me know when you're done.

374
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:19,398
- I'll wait right here.
- I was looking at their bag.

375
00:23:19,607 --> 00:23:21,192
They have <i>gajar kaa halwa</i>.

376
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:22,318
Oh, please. Don't lie.

377
00:23:24,028 --> 00:23:25,863
[indistinct chatter]

378
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:29,867
Oh Prem, is this your wife?

379
00:23:30,368 --> 00:23:31,369
Yes. I...

380
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:33,412
- Have brought her for an outing!
- Yes.

381
00:23:33,704 --> 00:23:35,331
- Hi, I'm Sandhya.
- This sister Parveen.

382
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:38,501
She is very pretty.
Do come over sometime.

383
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:40,169
I don't live very far from here.

384
00:23:40,378 --> 00:23:42,213
- Come over some day.
- Yes, will bring her over.

385
00:23:42,296 --> 00:23:44,298
You keep quite! As if you will do so.

386
00:23:44,382 --> 00:23:45,550
Oh! Tehmeena.

387
00:23:45,633 --> 00:23:47,426
- Get my purse, quickly.
- [Man] Prem!

388
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:50,763
- [indistinct chatter]
- C'mon let's go now.

389
00:23:51,013 --> 00:23:53,182
- Let's go from here.
- At least let me talk to her.

390
00:23:54,892 --> 00:23:55,893
Listen, sister!

391
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:59,564
Sweets, I completed my engineering.
Here are some sweets.

392
00:24:00,523 --> 00:24:02,567
Please take half!
Have to give everyone.

393
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,528
What was the hurry?

394
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:07,822
Didn't even let me speak to her.

395
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:13,035
Why are you getting so angry?

396
00:24:13,202 --> 00:24:14,203
What did I do?

397
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:19,292
I am talking to you.

398
00:24:20,418 --> 00:24:22,753
Please take us to govt. library.

399
00:24:23,588 --> 00:24:25,131
Then maybe I should walk...

400
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:37,101
[background music]

401
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:15,723
Listen, I want to clearly...

402
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:17,391
It's a library.

403
00:25:27,818 --> 00:25:29,695
I don't like talking to people.

404
00:25:30,363 --> 00:25:32,198
I didn't ask you to talk.

405
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:34,951
I was talking. What's your problem?

406
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:37,370
These shopkeepers...

407
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:39,538
I don't like talking to them.

408
00:25:39,789 --> 00:25:42,375
I also don't like people
interrupting me all the time.

409
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:47,296
Do you have a problem
if I talk to people?

410
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:51,008
Do you have any idea
what all happens here?

411
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,551
You'll go back home.

412
00:25:53,135 --> 00:25:55,179
They'll chew my brains.

413
00:25:55,763 --> 00:25:58,057
"Prem didn't treat us for his wedding!"

414
00:25:58,432 --> 00:25:59,934
My father was right.

415
00:26:00,268 --> 00:26:03,729
People from Haridwar are big misers.

416
00:26:33,884 --> 00:26:36,137
Today, your daughter-in-law
wanted to see a movie.

417
00:26:36,304 --> 00:26:39,307
So your father is setting up VCR
in their room.

418
00:26:39,432 --> 00:26:42,018
She should have got
VCR from her house.

419
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:43,519
We'll miss the serial now.

420
00:26:43,686 --> 00:26:45,104
One day makes no difference.

421
00:26:45,438 --> 00:26:46,814
As if it'll move ahead.

422
00:26:47,023 --> 00:26:48,399
The same thing keeps happening.

423
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:49,650
Ok, I'll disconnect now.

424
00:26:49,859 --> 00:26:51,777
Ask Hema to call me
in the morning, ok?

425
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:52,987
Good girl!

426
00:26:53,529 --> 00:26:55,823
Aunty, shall I close the window?

427
00:26:56,365 --> 00:26:57,408
Sure.

428
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:58,909
Put a lock on the door as well!

429
00:27:07,043 --> 00:27:09,670
[closing and locking door]

430
00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:12,798
Listen!

431
00:27:13,883 --> 00:27:14,967
Please close the window.

432
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:16,844
- What?
- Window.

433
00:27:31,692 --> 00:27:34,028
Set the movie in the VCR.

434
00:28:12,066 --> 00:28:13,067
[loading VCR]

435
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:14,235
[Sandhya] I'm ready!

436
00:28:30,126 --> 00:28:31,544
You'll not see?

437
00:28:32,795 --> 00:28:33,921
I don't feel like it.

438
00:28:34,672 --> 00:28:37,133
Then send the TV back outside.

439
00:28:38,008 --> 00:28:40,469
- I'll ask father...
- Why are you dragging father in this?

440
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,889
We shall see. We'll see it together.

441
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:48,394
[bed cranking]

442
00:28:51,021 --> 00:28:52,148
Turn off the lights.

443
00:28:58,362 --> 00:29:00,114
[lights off]

444
00:29:03,784 --> 00:29:05,578
[sound from TV]

00:29:39,904 --> 00:29:41,572
[funny background music]

447
00:29:50,164 --> 00:29:51,540
Blanket?

448
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:04,720
[girl moaning and smooching in TV]

449
00:30:20,486 --> 00:30:21,487
Water?

450
00:30:23,113 --> 00:30:24,114
Yes.

451
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:43,968
[bed shaking]

452
00:30:47,388 --> 00:30:49,974
[bed shaking continues]

453
00:30:50,391 --> 00:30:52,101
Our son has grown up!

454
00:30:53,227 --> 00:30:56,230
By the grace of god,
everything is ok.

455
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:57,731
Where are you going?

456
00:30:58,649 --> 00:31:00,276
I'll call Jaya and tell her.

457
00:31:00,776 --> 00:31:03,070
She'll be at peace then.

458
00:31:03,237 --> 00:31:04,780
Call her tomorrow!

459
00:31:12,371 --> 00:31:15,624
[background music]

460
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:21,005
How long did you see the film?

461
00:31:21,505 --> 00:31:23,549
Unlike you, I don't leave
things in between.

462
00:31:23,841 --> 00:31:24,883
I saw the whole film.

463
00:31:25,634 --> 00:31:27,011
Till the end.

464
00:31:32,725 --> 00:31:34,935
Who lights coal at your place?

465
00:31:35,269 --> 00:31:37,354
We don't have cinder,
we've a heater.

466
00:31:38,105 --> 00:31:39,690
- Will you have something?
- No.

467
00:31:39,857 --> 00:31:42,067
- Eat something.
- He'll eat, get him a plate.

468
00:31:42,776 --> 00:31:44,570
What were you saying
about your exams, Samar?

469
00:31:44,778 --> 00:31:47,072
Maths was tricky, rest was ok.

470
00:31:47,448 --> 00:31:49,033
Just make sure you pass!

471
00:31:49,199 --> 00:31:50,534
No one has failed in our family.

472
00:31:50,701 --> 00:31:52,953
I'm struggling to get full marks!

473
00:31:53,329 --> 00:31:56,415
Seems like god has given
all good things to your family.

474
00:31:56,707 --> 00:31:58,083
Excellent, I'd say!

475
00:31:58,626 --> 00:32:00,753
[Naintara] Here, take the offering.
May god bless you.

476
00:32:00,836 --> 00:32:03,130
[Chandrabhan] This is Prem's aunt.

477
00:32:03,797 --> 00:32:05,174
- What happened?
- Sister is here.

478
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:06,383
- See you, father.
- Oh, so you're leaving?

479
00:32:06,467 --> 00:32:07,760
[Chandrabhan] Bride is leaving!

480
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:10,429
- Oh, let him eat something.
- I have had, aunty.

481
00:32:10,971 --> 00:32:13,432
They definitely eat less,
but somehow they are healthy.

482
00:32:13,891 --> 00:32:15,309
Here, take the offering.

483
00:32:16,769 --> 00:32:18,896
It's called metabolism, aunty.

484
00:32:19,355 --> 00:32:20,564
Bye.

485
00:32:23,776 --> 00:32:25,110
Where's our Kumar Sanu?

486
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:28,405
What're you doing inside?
She's leaving, take her luggage.

487
00:32:32,326 --> 00:32:34,328
[Chandra Prakash] Convey my regards
to your father.

488
00:32:34,495 --> 00:32:37,331
- [Sashi] Be careful.
- Ok, mother.

489
00:32:48,592 --> 00:32:49,593
Ok, listen!

490
00:32:49,802 --> 00:32:53,681
I've left the list of songs on the table.
Make the mix tape.

491
00:32:53,931 --> 00:32:55,224
Will do if I get time.

492
00:32:55,766 --> 00:32:57,351
Come on the 4th, ok?

493
00:32:58,018 --> 00:33:00,354
- What's on the 4th?
- My mother's marriage.

494
00:33:00,813 --> 00:33:02,147
Let's go, Samar.

495
00:33:04,525 --> 00:33:08,612
[scooter sputtering]

496
00:33:13,534 --> 00:33:15,828
At the time of the wedding,
I couldn't say anything to dad.

497
00:33:17,246 --> 00:33:18,747
Yesterday night, couldn't stop myself.

498
00:33:19,623 --> 00:33:22,626
Gravitational pull of marital bliss
will pull me in, Saakha sir.

499
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:25,921
A man who could not
control his temptation.

500
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:27,506
What do I teach him?

501
00:33:27,798 --> 00:33:29,842
I can't utter a word
in front of her and

502
00:33:30,426 --> 00:33:32,136
- You're talking about controlling senses.
- No, no.

503
00:33:32,219 --> 00:33:33,554
This is a lie, Prem.

504
00:33:34,054 --> 00:33:35,347
Accept the reality.

505
00:33:36,432 --> 00:33:38,851
I don't like her looks,
so how can I accept her?

506
00:33:39,977 --> 00:33:42,438
[happy music in background]

507
00:33:54,241 --> 00:33:55,325
How do I look?

508
00:33:55,743 --> 00:33:58,120
No matter what you do,
you'll look like a witch forever.

509
00:33:59,747 --> 00:34:01,623
I will wack you!

510
00:34:07,337 --> 00:34:09,006
My life is directionless now.

511
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:12,176
There is no escape, Saakha sir.

512
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:14,970
Then give up, son.

513
00:34:17,097 --> 00:34:18,474
It's no gravitational pull,

514
00:34:19,141 --> 00:34:21,310
it's an attraction for your lady.

515
00:34:22,394 --> 00:34:23,687
There's no shame in enjoying it.

516
00:34:23,771 --> 00:34:24,772
Listen!

517
00:34:25,189 --> 00:34:26,732
Women are not solace for me.

518
00:34:27,316 --> 00:34:29,318
It's just a physical attraction.

519
00:34:30,027 --> 00:34:32,321
Then enjoy the physical attraction.

520
00:34:32,863 --> 00:34:34,198
Why do you come here then?

521
00:34:38,118 --> 00:34:43,040
[Sandhya] <i>Every object on Earth
is attracted to another object.</i>

proceed towards each other?</i>

525
00:34:55,302 --> 00:34:57,429
<i>Why do they stick to their own places?</i>

526
00:34:57,930 --> 00:35:02,184
Because these objects try
pulling each other

527
00:35:02,351 --> 00:35:04,686
and hence, do not move
from their place.

528
00:35:20,536 --> 00:35:21,537

529
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,205
- [Prem] This one?
- [Man] Yes. Press this.

530
00:35:25,082 --> 00:35:26,333
Now, listen to its sound.

531
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:29,753
- Is this the CD, or this is?
- Uncle, this is the CD.

532
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,506

533
00:35:32,756 --> 00:35:34,383

[Man] How did you like it's sound?

536
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:45,727
The sound is indeed very good.

537
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:48,188
Will get you started in 100,000 or so.

538

If you want, I can organize
the CD dealing as well.

539
00:35:50,774 --> 00:35:52,651
You'll get us some money
for all this, right?

540
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:54,987
Oh, uncle, no one wants this now.

541
00:35:55,237 --> 00:35:58,490
If you get 1000-2000 for this,
you should be thankful.

542
00:35:59,074 --> 00:36:01,410
- [Prem] Leave it then!
- [Man] No one wants it.

543

We will need to set up
the entire business again.

544
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:08,375
Take money from Raghubir!

545
00:36:09,918 --> 00:36:12,170
Had taken money from him
for my girls' wedding.

546
00:36:12,754 --> 00:36:14,840
Now, I just want to die!

...against taking loan

549
00:36:20,345 --> 00:36:22,222

and go to sleep?

00:36:45,829 --> 00:36:46,830

He must have got some work.

560

Call him from Vasudha's house.

561
00:36:50,792 --> 00:36:52,502
He could have also called, right?

562
00:36:52,753 --> 00:36:54,504
Don't compare yourself to him.

563
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:57,049

There's no comparison.

Please serve less, ok?

567
00:37:04,806 --> 00:37:05,807
You're serving so much.

568

Leave some for him too.

569
00:37:07,309 --> 00:37:08,852

only your name could be heard.

Get a plate for him, quick!

581
00:37:55,023 --> 00:37:57,192
No, it's ok. I need
to open shop in the morning.

582
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:58,318
Have something at least.

No. Festival season is going on.

584

- Here!
- Keep it.

It's a small token. Keep it.

something about you.

- the household you ran!
- Enough! At least respect her age.

701
00:47:42,986 --> 00:47:44,946
- Hello!
- Hello.

702
00:47:45,071 --> 00:47:46,489
How come you, Raghu?

703
00:47:46,739 --> 00:47:47,865
This is for you.

704
00:47:47,949 --> 00:47:49,075
What is this?

705
00:47:49,284 --> 00:47:50,285
- Sweets!
- And this...

706
00:47:51,369 --> 00:47:52,370
Invite!

707
00:47:52,787 --> 00:47:53,830
- Wedding invite?
- Yes.

708
00:47:54,414 --> 00:47:55,456
- His wedding?
- Yes!

709
00:47:55,999 --> 00:47:57,000
Oh my!

710
00:47:57,083 --> 00:47:58,126
Blessings!

711
00:47:58,334 --> 00:47:59,669
Listen, everyone! Prem,

712
00:48:00,128 --> 00:48:04,007
He chose a girl in college.
Is this being taught in engineering?

713
00:48:04,257 --> 00:48:07,010
No, no. The girl is a dentist.

714
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:09,262
Poor Prem was ruined by English.

715
00:48:09,554 --> 00:48:11,139
Otherwise, he would have...

716
00:48:11,264 --> 00:48:13,224
What are you blabbering?
Please call our daughter-in-law.

717
00:48:13,308 --> 00:48:14,475
She is working inside.

718
00:48:14,642 --> 00:48:15,852
Why're you calling her?

719
00:48:16,019 --> 00:48:17,020
[Sandhya] <i>Yes, father?</i>

720
00:48:18,938 --> 00:48:20,064
Hello, sister-in-law.

721
00:48:20,231 --> 00:48:21,899
That day I called out,

722
00:48:22,483 --> 00:48:23,610
but you didn't listen to me.

723
00:48:23,735 --> 00:48:25,028
He just vanished with you.

724
00:48:27,947 --> 00:48:29,032
You have to come.

725
00:48:29,157 --> 00:48:30,158
Both of you, for sure.

726
00:48:31,075 --> 00:48:33,286
- Ok, will come.
- What, ok?

727
00:48:34,078 --> 00:48:36,080
Sister-in-law, he'll not listen to me,

728
00:48:36,372 --> 00:48:37,373
he'll just listen to you.

729
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:39,250
You have to drag him to my place.

730
00:48:39,375 --> 00:48:40,835
- It's your responsibility.
- Have tea.

731
00:48:41,044 --> 00:48:42,045
Please have tea.

732
00:48:42,211 --> 00:48:43,212
It's getting cold.

733
00:48:45,131 --> 00:48:46,174
[Nirmal's father] You too.

734
00:48:47,216 --> 00:48:48,635
[Chandrabhan] What's the point now?

735
00:48:50,595 --> 00:48:52,138
[wedding music]

736
00:48:59,187 --> 00:49:00,438
[Nirmal] Told Dipti's father

737
00:49:00,647 --> 00:49:02,273
that at least 500 guests will be there
from our side.

738
00:49:02,357 --> 00:49:03,441
Park will not do.

739
00:49:03,691 --> 00:49:04,692
Arrange community centre.

740
00:49:04,901 --> 00:49:07,695
Told her uncle
that we need 21 gun's salute.

741
00:49:08,154 --> 00:49:10,198
They both agreed!
This is a gift from them!

742
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:12,950
Made in Japan. Very nice!
Very good sound!

743
00:49:13,117 --> 00:49:14,118
- [Nirmal] Shakha sir!
- Hmm.

744
00:49:14,327 --> 00:49:15,328
[Nirmal] Request a song.

745
00:49:15,495 --> 00:49:16,788
Play any, son!

746
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:18,456
Tell the number and it'll play.

747
00:49:18,623 --> 00:49:21,167
See, I'm old school,
a fossil, really.

748
00:49:21,542 --> 00:49:23,753
This guy Prem is new to marriage,

749
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:24,921
so ask him.

750
00:49:25,004 --> 00:49:27,048
Even I want to venture, Shakha sir.

751
00:49:27,382 --> 00:49:29,509
The girl's father is playing a villian.

752
00:49:30,051 --> 00:49:32,220
Shakha sir says marriage serves
no purpose.

753
00:49:32,387 --> 00:49:33,471
Isn't it, Shakha sir?

754
00:49:33,805 --> 00:49:36,224
No point thinking
after entering lion's den.

755
00:49:36,933 --> 00:49:39,435
Dipti is not a lion,
Dipti is a lioness. Right?

756
00:49:39,686 --> 00:49:41,145
Show Prem your lioness's picture.

757
00:49:41,312 --> 00:49:42,855
Shall I show him the picture?

758
00:49:44,315 --> 00:49:45,316
Prem.

759
00:49:45,525 --> 00:49:47,694
She is looking so pretty
in such a small picture.

760
00:49:48,486 --> 00:49:49,779
Pretty, isn't she?

761
00:49:50,238 --> 00:49:52,657
Leave this, you tell!
How's it going with you?

762
00:49:54,283 --> 00:49:55,284
You can see it.

763
00:49:55,410 --> 00:49:58,579
[people singing and dancing]

764
00:50:01,082 --> 00:50:02,375
Prem, you have had enough.

765
00:50:02,458 --> 00:50:05,294
- Sister-in-law will get upset.
- To hell with her.

766
00:50:05,753 --> 00:50:07,463
Prem, control yourself.

767
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:08,923
Give me the glass.

768
00:50:09,048 --> 00:50:12,260
I respect you, Shakha sir.
Your word is gospel's truth

769
00:50:12,468 --> 00:50:13,594
But today, don't say a word.

770
00:50:13,886 --> 00:50:14,887
Leave it!

771
00:50:15,096 --> 00:50:17,056
Leave me. Don't touch me.

772
00:50:18,099 --> 00:50:20,017
My father has ruined my life.

773
00:50:20,351 --> 00:50:21,352
I am totally ruined.

774
00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:24,063
Few friends like you, left me alone.

775
00:50:24,522 --> 00:50:25,523
Lower your voice!

776
00:50:26,065 --> 00:50:29,235
- It's Nirmal's wedding.
- Hats off to you, Nirmal. You are set.

777
00:50:30,153 --> 00:50:32,280
You worked hard, studied hard

778
00:50:32,405 --> 00:50:34,198
and became a gentleman.
I am the opposite of it.

779
00:50:34,282 --> 00:50:36,784
I'm a failure. You fiancee is so pretty.

780
00:50:38,286 --> 00:50:40,580
Your life would be heaven,
trust me on this.

781
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:44,333
I had no clue what was going on.
Couldn't say yes or no.

782
00:50:44,709 --> 00:50:46,711
Dad had put a leash on me

783
00:50:47,336 --> 00:50:49,338
and now I'm just a dog,
going here and there.

784
00:50:50,423 --> 00:50:51,549
- Oh, Prem!
- Prem.

785
00:50:52,967 --> 00:50:55,428
[wedding music playing]

786
00:50:55,970 --> 00:50:57,180
Sister-in-law is good-natured.

787
00:50:57,430 --> 00:50:59,724
Looks are not everything.
Why shouldn't it be so?

788
00:51:00,224 --> 00:51:01,642
Why is he showing me Dipti's picture?

789
00:51:01,726 --> 00:51:03,561
Why do you circle around Sonu, tell me!

790
00:51:03,686 --> 00:51:06,272
- Because you're my brother!
- Leave, it, dude.

791
00:51:06,856 --> 00:51:08,441
She's such a fat cow.

792
00:51:08,608 --> 00:51:10,818
Don't feel like touching her.
Leave alone doing anything else.

793
00:51:10,902 --> 00:51:12,111
- Shut up!
- I should shut up?

794
00:51:12,278 --> 00:51:16,032
Vijay, if you had to sleep in my place
with Sandhya for a night,

795
00:51:16,282 --> 00:51:18,201
that's when it'll feel like hell.

796
00:51:27,919 --> 00:51:30,922

[door closing]

798
00:52:20,805 --> 00:52:23,057
So you've started drinking now!

799
00:52:23,266 --> 00:52:26,269
- Oh, brother stop!
- [Prem] Aunty, save me.

800
00:52:26,769 --> 00:52:29,897
- Stop it!
- Tried explaining to him so many times.

801
00:52:30,314 --> 00:52:33,234
I'll kill him. You move aside.

802
00:52:33,818 --> 00:52:35,987
Oh, brother, what are you doing?

803
00:52:43,494 --> 00:52:44,829
I'm hurt!

804
00:52:45,246 --> 00:52:46,622
I hit my younger sister, see!

805
00:52:46,831 --> 00:52:50,167
It's all because of you.
I'll not leave you.

806
00:52:50,376 --> 00:52:53,337
[all in chaos]

807
00:52:53,671 --> 00:52:57,174
Dear, where're you going?
We can sort it out.

808
00:52:57,425 --> 00:53:01,220
Look, how his father is hitting him.

809
00:53:01,512 --> 00:53:04,348
- Stop him.
- He's his father, he knows well.

810
00:53:04,473 --> 00:53:07,560
- Listen!
- What happened? Where is she going?

811
00:53:07,727 --> 00:53:11,188
Wait! Listen to me.
Take this slipper

812
00:53:11,397 --> 00:53:12,523
and go, hit him.

813
00:53:12,648 --> 00:53:14,191
Leave it, father!

814
00:53:14,609 --> 00:53:17,028
I'm not angry with Prem, but you!

815
00:53:17,361 --> 00:53:21,324
Helping him in studies
instead of marriage would have helped.

816
00:53:23,159 --> 00:53:24,327
Wait please!

817
00:53:24,785 --> 00:53:25,786

What the hell are you doing?

822
00:54:10,623 --> 00:54:11,749
At least tell us!

823
00:54:11,832 --> 00:54:14,502
- Why are you throwing stuff?
- Why did you give my room to Samar?

824
00:54:14,794 --> 00:54:17,838
You didn't intimate us about your coming.

825
00:54:18,673 --> 00:54:20,967
I've left Prem.
Now stop asking questions.

826
00:54:21,175 --> 00:54:22,718
Left him? What do you mean?

827
00:54:22,969 --> 00:54:24,136
At least ask her, what happened?

What nonsense is this!

829
00:54:25,513 --> 00:54:26,806
Did he hit you?

830

- Then I'll teach him a lesson.
- Why are you dragging me?

831

Now I'll not get full marks in biology.

I'll do the same to you as those books.

00:54:37,149 --> 00:54:40,027
Don't stand here,
go and call them from a PCO.

836
00:54:40,194 --> 00:54:41,237
Ask what happened?

837
00:54:41,362 --> 00:54:42,697
Nobody will call them.

838
00:54:42,905 --> 00:54:44,532
I promise I'll kill myself.

839
00:54:44,865 --> 00:54:47,159
What is this behavior?

840
00:54:47,451 --> 00:54:49,620
Tell us what happened,
why have you come here?

841
00:54:50,204 --> 00:54:51,414
He doesn't need me

842
00:54:51,789 --> 00:54:53,457
and neither do I, mother.

843
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:56,293
He wanted to get married, right?

844
00:54:56,919 --> 00:54:59,046
But he has no manners.

845
00:54:59,922 --> 00:55:02,174
He embarrassed me in front of everyone.

846
00:55:02,591 --> 00:55:05,511
He called me fat and other names, mother.

847
00:55:05,761 --> 00:55:08,347
- So, what's wrong in that? You're fat!
- You shut up!

848

Why bother listening to men?

[Subadhra] Why do you
compete with him?

851
00:55:14,645 --> 00:55:16,814
Even if he said something,
you should've ignored.

852
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:18,524
You should've kept quite.

853
00:55:18,816 --> 00:55:19,859
Why should I stay quite?

854
00:55:20,526 --> 00:55:21,652
I slapped him hard.

855
00:55:22,194 --> 00:55:24,822
Now he'll not dare to speak
to a woman like that.

856
00:55:24,989 --> 00:55:28,284
Oh dear lord!
Educate her and make her upstanding!

- Mother, stop crying.

- Enough, mom.

- That's what gives meaning to...
- That's enough, mom. Now go.

00:56:23,047 --> 00:56:25,257
[Shakha] Ok,
in "Give in all your energy" competition,

876
00:56:25,424 --> 00:56:27,051
along with power,
use your brain as well.

877
00:56:27,301 --> 00:56:28,344
[Shakha] How?

878
00:56:28,469 --> 00:56:29,720
Like this! Joshi ji...

879
00:56:34,016 --> 00:56:35,226
[clapping]

880
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:40,731
That's it!

881
00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:43,818
Like this, you achieve your target.

882
00:56:44,276 --> 00:56:46,529
Now, Joshi ji, please get down.

883
00:56:50,324 --> 00:56:51,742
Now start the exercise.

884
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:54,370
What happened, Shakha sir?

885
00:56:55,454 --> 00:56:56,455
You're ignoring me.

886
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:58,582
No, son, nothing like that.

887
00:56:58,916 --> 00:57:00,960
"Give in all your energy" competition
is coming up.

888
00:57:01,335 --> 00:57:02,419
So, preparing for that.

889
00:57:03,629 --> 00:57:05,131
You didn't invite me to exercise!

890
00:57:06,507 --> 00:57:08,592
You know what all happened, right?

891
00:57:09,301 --> 00:57:10,553
- Had I called you...
- Yes, right.

892
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:12,680
You teach about revolt,

893
00:57:12,805 --> 00:57:14,807
- but you suck Nirmal's feet.
- Prem!

894
00:57:15,766 --> 00:57:16,809
Don't misbehave.

895
00:57:17,143 --> 00:57:18,644
Otherwise you"ll be in trouble.

896
00:57:19,478 --> 00:57:21,730
Misbehave? Since my wife left,
nobody is talking to me.

897
00:57:23,691 --> 00:57:24,984
Cool down, now.

898
00:57:25,067 --> 00:57:27,486
- Let's sit and talk.
- Not interested! I've thought it through.

899
00:57:27,570 --> 00:57:29,697
Everyone is gloating in my misery.

900
00:57:29,989 --> 00:57:31,323
What nonsense are you saying?

901
00:57:31,532 --> 00:57:32,533
Let's move aside!

902
00:57:32,616 --> 00:57:35,703
- Leave my hand, I'll hit you.
- You'll hit me?

903
00:57:36,078 --> 00:57:37,079
You scoundrel!

904
00:57:37,329 --> 00:57:39,248
You tease me by showing picture
of your pretty wife?

905
00:57:39,331 --> 00:57:42,251
- Don't mention my wife!
- I will throw you in the pond.

906
00:57:42,334 --> 00:57:45,045
- [Shakha] Quite!
- How's he talking? Is this the way?

907
00:57:45,171 --> 00:57:47,715
- Go now.
- [Vijay] He's upset. I'll take care.

908
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:49,592
Enough, I've had enough.

909
00:57:49,967 --> 00:57:51,886
We don't need people like him here.

910
00:57:52,303 --> 00:57:54,054
- [Vijay] I'll explain to him.
- Take him away.

911
00:57:54,138 --> 00:57:55,472
Take him from here, go.

912
00:57:56,015 --> 00:57:57,016
Take him away.

913
00:57:57,933 --> 00:58:00,895
[Shakha] Tell him to cool down.
It's too much.

914
00:58:02,646 --> 00:58:04,023
[Shakha] Wants to revolt it seems.

915
00:58:05,858 --> 00:58:07,234
[Lawyer] Aunty, you don't worry,

916
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:09,820
These days, law is with women.
You should believe in yourself

917
00:58:10,112 --> 00:58:11,530
and believe in the power of women.

918
00:58:11,655 --> 00:58:14,366
There're so many amendments
that favour women these days.

919
00:58:14,575 --> 00:58:16,202
Sandhya's case is very strong.

920
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:18,287
So, they'll be together?

921
00:58:18,454 --> 00:58:21,582
- She's talking about separating them.
- Then why is she smiling?

922
00:58:21,707 --> 00:58:23,042
You want her to cry and say that?

923
00:58:25,211 --> 00:58:26,337
- [Sandhya] Water.
- Thank you.

924
00:58:27,379 --> 00:58:28,714
- Move.
- Ok.

925
00:58:30,633 --> 00:58:33,135
[Lawyer] Sandhya, did you change
your last name, in passport

926
00:58:33,427 --> 00:58:34,720
or in any other papers?

927
00:58:35,054 --> 00:58:36,055
No.

928
00:58:36,263 --> 00:58:37,681
Did you give any dowry?

929
00:58:37,932 --> 00:58:40,226
Any TV, VCR,
sofa set, scooter, anything?

930
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:41,560
Whom to give TV?

931
00:58:41,644 --> 00:58:43,479
She's asking if we have given dowry.

932
00:58:43,729 --> 00:58:45,898
- I'm talking!
- Ok, do then.

933
00:58:46,857 --> 00:58:47,858
No, we didn't.

934
00:58:48,025 --> 00:58:49,693
We may have spent about
15-20 thousand

935
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:51,320
on clothes and jewellery.

936
00:58:51,570 --> 00:58:54,031
We didn't spend a single penny.

937
00:58:54,365 --> 00:58:56,909
Her jewellery is already
with her mother.

938
00:58:57,076 --> 00:58:58,327
It's safe in my bank locker.

939
00:58:58,661 --> 00:58:59,662
Wait a minute.

940
00:58:59,995 --> 00:59:01,247
What about mental trauma?

941
00:59:01,413 --> 00:59:02,539
Who'll pay for that?

942
00:59:02,790 --> 00:59:04,625
Sandhya, that's no way
to talk to your parents.

943
00:59:04,917 --> 00:59:06,835
They want your good as well. Say sorry!

944
00:59:07,044 --> 00:59:08,087
Don't instigate her.

945
00:59:08,337 --> 00:59:10,297
We've given her good education as well.

946
00:59:10,422 --> 00:59:11,423
[Lawyer] Ahh, sorry?

947
00:59:11,507 --> 00:59:12,633
She asking her to say sorry.

948
00:59:12,716 --> 00:59:13,842
Say sorry to whom?

949
00:59:13,926 --> 00:59:14,969
To you.

950
00:59:15,761 --> 00:59:17,012
Sandhya, don't loose heart, ok?

951
00:59:17,638 --> 00:59:20,140
Just concentrate on your studies
and give exams.

952
00:59:20,432 --> 00:59:21,433
Thanks a lot, sister.

953
00:59:21,850 --> 00:59:23,352
Aunty, you also don't worry.

954
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:25,479
Divorce and all is very cool these days.

955
00:59:25,771 --> 00:59:27,940
This is just a way
to spend your life happily.

956
00:59:29,066 --> 00:59:30,859
Madam, we know nothing about law,

957
00:59:31,151 --> 00:59:34,446
but this much I know for sure that
I've lived my life happily with him.

958
00:59:35,406 --> 00:59:36,407
I'm sure!

959
00:59:37,074 --> 00:59:38,325
Please come!

960
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:40,911
Yes.

961
00:59:41,078 --> 00:59:42,496
- Keep it inside.
- Will do.

962
00:59:43,539 --> 00:59:44,540
Are you drunk?

963
00:59:46,125 --> 00:59:47,126
Don't be stupid.

964
00:59:47,334 --> 00:59:48,502
Go and get her back.

965
00:59:48,961 --> 00:59:50,004
No way!

966
00:59:51,422 --> 00:59:52,923
I don't want to live like this.

967
00:59:54,133 --> 00:59:55,968
I'll try and make something for myself.

968
00:59:56,885 --> 00:59:57,886
Oh, hello!

969
00:59:58,137 --> 01:00:01,724
Is this a movie dialogue?
It looks good in movies only.

970
01:00:02,641 --> 01:00:06,145
People like us
should stay connected to reality.

971
01:00:06,937 --> 01:00:08,522
I'll reappear for my 10th standard exam.

972
01:00:08,939 --> 01:00:10,566
I'll not stay with these people.

973
01:00:12,151 --> 01:00:13,360
Are you crazy?

974
01:00:13,736 --> 01:00:14,820
You're a married person.

975
01:00:15,738 --> 01:00:19,116
Wife is a teacher
and he wants to be a student.

976
01:00:20,451 --> 01:00:21,452
Look at me!

977
01:00:21,994 --> 01:00:24,246
Would I not like to go to Mumbai?

978
01:00:24,413 --> 01:00:26,582
I would want to be an actor.

979
01:00:26,915 --> 01:00:30,753
But my father refused and
made me sit here in the shop.

980
01:00:34,214 --> 01:00:35,674
Now, my only dream is

981
01:00:36,258 --> 01:00:39,553
that Suman's father
agrees for our marriage, that's it.

982
01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:41,722
But you love Suman.

983
01:00:42,973 --> 01:00:46,060
If her father gets her married
elsewhere, will you not do anything?

984
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:49,605
Prem, reel and real life are different.

985
01:00:50,606 --> 01:00:52,733
Do you know the reality of my life?

986
01:00:52,816 --> 01:00:53,942
See this.

987
01:00:54,026 --> 01:00:55,652
"Ma'am, 36 B."

988
01:00:56,111 --> 01:00:57,404
"Ma'am, 36 D."

989
01:00:57,780 --> 01:00:59,198
"Elastic is good and long-lasting."

990
01:00:59,448 --> 01:01:01,200
Rascal, you too are against me.

991
01:01:02,034 --> 01:01:03,285
I was ok alone here.

992
01:01:07,122 --> 01:01:09,041
[Vijay] Fine, do as you please.

993
01:01:34,441 --> 01:01:36,735
<i>- Saraswati Coaching Centre?</i>
- [Man] <i>Yes, come in.</i>

994
01:01:37,611 --> 01:01:40,239
I wanted a form for 10th grade board exam.

995
01:01:40,406 --> 01:01:43,117
- Have you brought ID proof?
- Yes.

996
01:01:46,995 --> 01:01:48,163
[cookery show in TV]

997
01:01:48,288 --> 01:01:50,082
She's going to feed us boiled food.

998
01:01:50,374 --> 01:01:52,543
Why're you interrupting? Let me see!

999
01:01:53,127 --> 01:01:55,671
To treat herself,
she'll make us all sick.

1000
01:01:56,130 --> 01:01:57,339
Have I stopped you?

1001
01:01:57,464 --> 01:02:00,259
[Sandhya] Make whatever you like.
I'm making for myself only.

1002
01:02:00,968 --> 01:02:05,055
This was left now. Ending your marriage,
you've come home

1003
01:02:05,431 --> 01:02:07,599
now wants to have a separate kitchen.

1004
01:02:07,808 --> 01:02:09,726
- Now what are you making?
- Poison.

1005
01:02:10,185 --> 01:02:11,228
You want some?

1006
01:02:11,395 --> 01:02:13,230
No, you can have it.

1007
01:03:40,484 --> 01:03:41,527
Father!

1008
01:03:43,195 --> 01:03:45,572
A new shop has come up?
Who is it?

1009
01:03:48,158 --> 01:03:49,159
This is the address.

1010
01:03:49,618 --> 01:03:52,454
- This is Nirmal's shop address.
- Let's see.

1011
01:03:52,955 --> 01:03:54,164
Nirmal has opened a shop?

1012
01:03:54,873 --> 01:03:57,167
[Chandra Prakash] Two recording
shops in the same location?

1013
01:03:57,459 --> 01:03:59,253
Listen, is this Nirmal Nautyal's shop?

1014
01:03:59,711 --> 01:04:01,046
It was rented out last week.

1015
01:04:01,630 --> 01:04:03,590
Meaning, new shop has opened?

1016
01:04:03,882 --> 01:04:06,134
Have done rituals now.
Will open on the 1st of next month.

1017
01:04:07,094 --> 01:04:08,136
Here we go!

1018
01:04:12,432 --> 01:04:13,892
MELODY MUSIC CENTRE

1019
01:04:14,643 --> 01:04:17,938
[Chandabhan] Nirmal, if you open a
recording shop, what'll happen to us?

1020
01:04:18,522 --> 01:04:21,108
See, son, you have everything.

1021
01:04:21,275 --> 01:04:22,359
That's right.

1022
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:24,736
You even have a wife!

1023
01:04:25,237 --> 01:04:27,239
You know how he behaved at Shakha?

1024
01:04:27,656 --> 01:04:29,157
I didn't want to come here after that.

1025
01:04:29,283 --> 01:04:31,618
- Father insisted me to...
- Nirmal, cool down.

1026
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:33,829
- Cool down!
- Look at you, all cool!

1027
01:04:34,162 --> 01:04:35,998
You didn't waste time
opening the new shop.

1028
01:04:36,373 --> 01:04:38,375
Look at him, he is disgusted in life.

1029
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:39,710
What shall we say!

1030
01:04:39,835 --> 01:04:41,712
It was bound to happen for sure.

1031
01:04:41,837 --> 01:04:44,131
Without his consent,
you all forced him to marry.

1032
01:04:44,214 --> 01:04:45,424
[Nirmal] A fat cow that too.

1033
01:04:45,549 --> 01:04:48,468
- How can a goat and cow be together?
- Shut your mouth!

1034
01:04:48,719 --> 01:04:50,470
See, look at his behaviour.

1035
01:04:50,596 --> 01:04:52,264
- How is he behaving?
- Listen, son!

1036
01:04:52,347 --> 01:04:55,142
Naina, why can't you keep quite?

1037
01:04:55,392 --> 01:04:57,060
- [Naintara] What did I say?
- What, what.

1038
01:04:57,477 --> 01:04:58,478
See, son,

1039
01:04:58,812 --> 01:05:00,397
this shop is our livelihood.

1040
01:05:00,689 --> 01:05:02,441
Look Chandrabhan, whatever it is,

1041
01:05:02,566 --> 01:05:06,445
we can't leave our household
and start a charity, right?

1042
01:05:06,737 --> 01:05:08,280
You must be very happy, uncle.

1043
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:10,240
Adding insult to injury.

1044
01:05:10,449 --> 01:05:13,493
You're jealous of other's progress.
I can see that.

1045
01:05:13,660 --> 01:05:15,996
Progress, what progress
are you talking about?

1046
01:05:16,455 --> 01:05:18,415
You became an engineer
because of the donation.

1047
01:05:18,957 --> 01:05:19,958
Then you do the same.

1048
01:05:20,042 --> 01:05:21,585
No one is stopping you.

1049
01:05:21,793 --> 01:05:23,879
Have we tied your hands?
Is your mind chained?

1050
01:05:24,046 --> 01:05:26,214
Look, Prem, only a thing does
not cost a dime - crying!

1051
01:05:26,381 --> 01:05:27,841
You can keep on doing that.

1052
01:05:27,966 --> 01:05:31,428
I'm talking nicely and you're taunting.
I'll kill you!

1053
01:05:31,678 --> 01:05:32,888
What're you doing?

1054
01:05:34,264 --> 01:05:36,558
Fight afterwards, have pastry first.

1055
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:38,852
It's her birthday, show some respect.

1056
01:05:39,102 --> 01:05:40,228
[everybody] Happy Birthday!

1057
01:05:40,604 --> 01:05:41,730
Let's sit there.

1058
01:05:42,731 --> 01:05:45,150
- Wish you a happy birthday.
- Ok!

1059
01:05:45,525 --> 01:05:46,526
Happy Birthday!

1060
01:05:47,653 --> 01:05:50,447
Want to save your shop? Fine.
Save it.

1061
01:05:50,864 --> 01:05:53,575
"Give in all your energy" competition
is coming, take part and win it.

1062
01:05:53,659 --> 01:05:55,535
If you win, will not give the shop
on rent and you'll save your shop.

1063
01:05:55,619 --> 01:05:57,746
[Nirmal's father] Nirmal, what is this?

1064
01:05:57,871 --> 01:05:59,498
[Naintara] This is too much.

1065
01:06:00,582 --> 01:06:01,625
I'm right, now you say.

1066
01:06:01,708 --> 01:06:03,251
You are despicable!

1067
01:06:03,502 --> 01:06:05,545
You want to start a shop?
Ok, go ahead, open it.

1068
01:06:05,796 --> 01:06:07,255
We've been in business for 15 years.

1069
01:06:07,547 --> 01:06:08,548
[muffled] Will see.

1070
01:06:08,799 --> 01:06:09,800
Listen!

1071
01:06:09,883 --> 01:06:12,427
Had I been married,
I would've taken part

1072
01:06:12,552 --> 01:06:14,012
in the competition.
I'm telling the truth.

1073
01:06:14,096 --> 01:06:15,430
[Sashi] Naina, shut up!

1074
01:06:16,056 --> 01:06:18,058
I have heard enough from father-son.

1075
01:06:18,266 --> 01:06:20,769
Listen, you'll participate
in the competition.

1076
01:06:21,061 --> 01:06:22,270
Mother, I will not!

1077
01:06:22,688 --> 01:06:23,855
Your husband will run with you.

1078
01:06:23,939 --> 01:06:25,857
You'll run with your wife!

1079
01:06:26,024 --> 01:06:27,776
You'll say whatever on your birthday?

1080
01:06:28,110 --> 01:06:29,111
I have decided.

1081
01:06:29,861 --> 01:06:30,904
He'll participate.

1082
01:06:31,196 --> 01:06:32,906
- Mother, I'll not.
- You'll run.

1083
01:06:36,868 --> 01:06:37,869
Mother has lost it!

1084
01:06:38,286 --> 01:06:40,956
As if we've not been humiliated enough
in the market.

1085
01:06:41,248 --> 01:06:43,583
- [utensil falling]
- What happened?

1086
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:44,751
What is the matter?

1087
01:06:44,876 --> 01:06:47,838
- Why are you lying down here?
- Father, she has fallen down.

1088
01:06:48,130 --> 01:06:49,131
[chaos]

1089
01:06:50,382 --> 01:06:51,383
What happened?

1090
01:06:52,551 --> 01:06:53,635
Sister!

1091
01:06:53,719 --> 01:06:55,470
These are divorce papers.

1092
01:06:56,138 --> 01:06:58,223
There goes the condition for the
competition invalid.

1093
01:07:02,227 --> 01:07:06,314
Understood. Pick her up.
Come on. Pick her.

1094
01:07:06,648 --> 01:07:08,608
Understood. Will do whatever you want.

1095
01:07:09,943 --> 01:07:12,571
- Once judge leaves, then don't say.
- Before the judge goes...

1096
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:15,198
- Let's go, Jugnu. Are you ready?
- Yes, father.

1097
01:07:15,866 --> 01:07:17,117
What's the matter?

1098
01:07:17,534 --> 01:07:18,910
I'll sit in the front.

1099
01:07:21,037 --> 01:07:23,206
- [Naina] Brother, help.
- [Sashi] Will you do something?

1100
01:07:23,373 --> 01:07:24,416
What should I do?

1101
01:07:24,583 --> 01:07:27,627
[indistinct chatter]

1102
01:07:28,086 --> 01:07:31,006
[Sashi] Push me, help me sit.

1103
01:07:31,173 --> 01:07:34,551
Seems the Tiwari clan is going to
get the bride back.

1104
01:07:35,135 --> 01:07:37,929
Seems you can't pass stool without
calling us out, brother.

1105
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:41,600
[Sashi] Drive carefully, ok?

1106
01:07:46,104 --> 01:07:47,606
This house is inauspicious.

1107
01:07:48,148 --> 01:07:50,150
It hasn't been good to anyone here.

1108
01:07:50,942 --> 01:07:53,445
Your sister's husband became a sage.

1109
01:07:54,237 --> 01:07:56,406
Parveen's husband is still in jail.

1110
01:07:56,990 --> 01:07:59,326
Underwear guy, Vijay
is not getting married.

1111
01:07:59,993 --> 01:08:02,496
Prem's marriage has ended in court.

1112
01:08:02,704 --> 01:08:05,749
Now, chant in the name of your mother,
not in the name of God.

1113
01:08:06,458 --> 01:08:08,835
She keeps talking nonsense even now.

1114
01:08:11,838 --> 01:08:13,840
Did I say something wrong?

1115
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:21,681
There'll be lots of crying. Stay calm.

1116
01:08:21,765 --> 01:08:24,267
It's better to cry once and for all.

1117
01:08:24,351 --> 01:08:25,727
I'm very proud of you, Sandhya.

1118
01:08:25,852 --> 01:08:28,188
Is everyone here getting divorced?

1119
01:08:28,980 --> 01:08:31,525
[indistinct chatter]

1120
01:08:33,193 --> 01:08:35,111
Please, don't talk nonsense.

1121
01:08:35,362 --> 01:08:38,490
Listen, Sandhya, tell me.
Anything else I should know?

1122
01:08:40,450 --> 01:08:43,954
- [indistinct chatter]
- Listen to me carefully,

1123
01:08:44,162 --> 01:08:47,415
No need to beg in front of Sandhya.
Papa will carry you and run.

1124
01:08:47,499 --> 01:08:49,960
[indistinct chatter]

1125
01:08:51,586 --> 01:08:53,046
- Hello.
- Hello.

1126
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:56,049
[Subadhra] Why is God punishing us?

1127
01:08:57,884 --> 01:08:59,761
What to do?

1128
01:08:59,845 --> 01:09:02,722
[Sashi] What has happened, sister?
Why're you crying?

1129
01:09:03,056 --> 01:09:05,559
We've been given a bad name.

1130
01:09:05,767 --> 01:09:09,938
I pray that even the worst
enemy should not face this fate.

1131
01:09:10,063 --> 01:09:11,815
Look, what has happened?

1132
01:09:11,898 --> 01:09:13,483
What have the kids done?

1133
01:09:13,567 --> 01:09:16,069
[crying continuously]

1134
01:09:18,238 --> 01:09:21,408
[Man] Sandhya Verma
and Prem Prakash Tiwari, Divorce Petition.

1135
01:09:22,742 --> 01:09:26,830
Husband, Prem Prakash Tiwari is accused
of insulting Sandhya Varma in public.

1136
01:09:27,038 --> 01:09:29,124
Hurting her physically and emotionally.

1137
01:09:29,249 --> 01:09:31,918
Sandhya Varma asks the court
to grant her divorce.

1138
01:09:32,294 --> 01:09:36,464
The Tiwaris must pay a
divorce settlement of 50,000 rupees.

1139
01:09:38,091 --> 01:09:39,718
[Judge] She has filed for divorce.

1140
01:09:40,218 --> 01:09:41,678
Do you agree?

1141
01:09:42,345 --> 01:09:43,346
Yes.

1142
01:09:44,556 --> 01:09:45,724
Was it a love marriage?

1143
01:09:46,141 --> 01:09:49,978
There is no love, only marriage.

1144
01:09:50,312 --> 01:09:51,771
Why did you agree then?

1145
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:54,524
I liked him.

1146
01:09:54,900 --> 01:09:55,984
And you?

1147
01:09:57,736 --> 01:10:00,447
We were financially strapped,
Sandhya was doing B.Ed.

1148
01:10:01,406 --> 01:10:04,701
Everyone pressed marrying her would
improve our financial condition.

1149
01:10:05,285 --> 01:10:06,286
I agreed!

1150
01:10:07,245 --> 01:10:10,707
[Judge] Relations, consummation,
physical relations etc...

1151
01:10:10,790 --> 01:10:12,459
These household matters
are not to be discussed in court.

1152
01:10:12,542 --> 01:10:15,086
But want to disgrace his wife before all?

1153
01:10:15,170 --> 01:10:16,463
- I...
- Hitting her

1154
01:10:16,546 --> 01:10:18,840
- is a matter of great pride?
- I'm sorry for that.

1155
01:10:19,507 --> 01:10:21,343
I can't move out of my house now.

1156
01:10:21,426 --> 01:10:24,429
Yeah, we live in a jungle.
We've no neighbours. What?

1157
01:10:24,512 --> 01:10:27,599
And what's this ridiculous
settlement demand of 50,000?

1158
01:10:27,849 --> 01:10:30,560
- Aren't we suffering enough?
- Have you ever thought about me?

1159
01:10:30,644 --> 01:10:32,771
- Did you think before slapping me?
- [Sashi] Prem.

1160
01:10:32,979 --> 01:10:34,147
[Judge] Order! Order!

1161
01:10:34,522 --> 01:10:35,690
[Judge] Keep quiet.

1162
01:10:36,608 --> 01:10:38,068
Family members want to say anything?

1163
01:10:38,568 --> 01:10:40,278
What can we say?

1164
01:10:40,362 --> 01:10:42,656
You are wise enough.
Please, tell them.

1165
01:10:42,739 --> 01:10:45,367
Utensils will surely will make sound.

1166
01:10:45,492 --> 01:10:48,119
Why leave the house, daughter?
Come back!

1167
01:10:48,411 --> 01:10:51,790
This is correct, Sir.
Prem's father and I fought too many times.

1168
01:10:51,957 --> 01:10:54,376
Once I put a little more salt
in his mother's food.

1169
01:10:54,584 --> 01:10:57,003
And he hit me so hard with his shoes.

1170
01:10:57,087 --> 01:10:59,631
- But I didn't leave my home.
- Am I talking Greek?

1171
01:10:59,714 --> 01:11:01,883
Your honour, I am asking her to come home.

1172
01:11:02,050 --> 01:11:03,551
Ok, you men will only talk!

1173
01:11:03,635 --> 01:11:07,097
- You just order us to cook and clean.
- Yes, mother, this is the right time.

1174
01:11:07,180 --> 01:11:08,890
File a case of domestic violence.

1175
01:11:09,015 --> 01:11:10,558
[Judge] Order, order.

1176
01:11:10,976 --> 01:11:15,063
Listen, these emotional talks should
be discussed outside the court.

1177
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:22,737
As per the marriage law, court will
ask you to stay together for 6 months.

1178
01:11:22,904 --> 01:11:26,408
And if even after that,
you're unable to sort things out,

1179
01:11:26,908 --> 01:11:28,910
the court will approve the divorce.

1180
01:11:30,829 --> 01:11:32,122
[Judge] Next!

1181
01:11:36,710 --> 01:11:38,795
See, it has been enough!
Now, come back.

1182
01:11:38,878 --> 01:11:40,046
Everyone is requesting you.

1183
01:11:40,130 --> 01:11:42,132
Go now, I'll get my room back.

1184
01:11:42,257 --> 01:11:44,342
Sandhya, if not for the law,
come back for us at least.

1185
01:11:44,426 --> 01:11:47,178
- First ask him to say sorry.
- Hey, come here.

1186
01:11:47,429 --> 01:11:49,389
Who slapped first, shall say sorry first.

1187
01:11:49,639 --> 01:11:51,307
Ok, and who forced me?

1188
01:11:51,516 --> 01:11:52,851
You'll say sorry first.

1189
01:11:53,018 --> 01:11:54,269
I'm saying it.

1190
01:11:54,853 --> 01:11:55,854
Sorry!

1191
01:11:57,105 --> 01:11:58,356
[laughing]

1192
01:11:58,440 --> 01:12:01,776
See Sandhya, now she's your
real mother, ok?

1193
01:12:01,860 --> 01:12:03,445
She is your responsibility, ok?

1194
01:12:03,611 --> 01:12:05,363
Here, hold this!

1195
01:12:05,780 --> 01:12:07,323
Please come, daughter!

1196
01:12:07,574 --> 01:12:11,661
The moment you held it,
I'm feeling better already.

1197
01:12:11,911 --> 01:12:15,331
[Announcer] <i>It's time to carry the weight
of your relations on your shoulders.</i>

1198
01:12:15,415 --> 01:12:20,378
'Because the pride of Hrishikesh
and Haridwar is back again.

1199
01:12:20,462 --> 01:12:23,506
All husbands! Flex your muscles.

1200
01:12:23,631 --> 01:12:27,010
All wives, lose some belly weight.

1201
01:12:27,177 --> 01:12:31,890
Because, "Give in all your energy"
competition is back.

1202
01:12:32,015 --> 01:12:34,142
<i>Attention, friends.</i>

1203
01:12:34,225 --> 01:12:38,772
<i>The winner gets 10,000 rupees, cash.</i>

1204
01:12:39,105 --> 01:12:44,527
<i>It's direct telecast
will be shown on cable TV, friends.</i>

1205
01:12:45,111 --> 01:12:50,784
<i>Friends, keep in mind.
"Give in all your energy" competition.</i>

1206
01:13:21,064 --> 01:13:22,482
Shall I say something?

1207
01:13:23,358 --> 01:13:24,526
- Yes.
- See.

1208
01:13:24,734 --> 01:13:27,654
It's not "of" Monday.
It's "on" Monday

1209
01:13:27,987 --> 01:13:30,573
And we say "in" August.
Not "on" August

1210
01:13:30,865 --> 01:13:33,284
Usage of preposition for day and
month is different.

1211
01:13:33,993 --> 01:13:36,830
- Why did you touch my book?
- But I was...

1212
01:13:36,913 --> 01:13:39,958
But why? Don't show off your education.

1213
01:13:40,834 --> 01:13:44,295
Ok. I know you're very smart, intelligent.
I know nothing.

1214
01:13:44,629 --> 01:13:46,673
I'm a fool and illiterate fellow.

1215
01:13:47,632 --> 01:13:49,884
This isn't going to work.

1216
01:13:50,135 --> 01:13:52,846
Look, it's an act for 6 months.

1217
01:13:53,179 --> 01:13:55,598
So, the happier we are,
better for both of us.

1218
01:13:56,057 --> 01:13:58,810
I'll go in 6 months,
"In" and not "on". Understand?

1219
01:14:02,939 --> 01:14:05,400
[humming music in background]

1220
01:14:12,782 --> 01:14:14,617
Give all these sheets in room 12.

1221
01:14:15,243 --> 01:14:16,369
I'm a student.

1222
01:14:17,704 --> 01:14:19,122
Roll no. 317.

1223
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:25,879
- Sit down.
- Thanks.

1224
01:15:10,798 --> 01:15:12,133
[Prem] <i>Respected teacher,</i>

1225
01:15:13,051 --> 01:15:14,761
<i>I'm 25 years old.</i>

1226
01:15:15,929 --> 01:15:19,641
<i>This is my third failed attempt
to clear the English exam.</i>

1227
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:23,978
<i>My father is right. I am a useless fellow.</i>

1228
01:15:24,896 --> 01:15:28,816
<i>The struggle to do something,
to prove myself worthy, ends here.</i>

1229
01:15:30,026 --> 01:15:31,778
<i>If you have a kind heart,</i>

1230
01:15:32,612 --> 01:15:34,530
<i>and if this letter makes emotional,</i>

1231
01:15:35,031 --> 01:15:36,616
<i>and your eyes get filled with tears.</i>

1232
01:15:36,991 --> 01:15:39,661
<i>And if nothing else
but you wish to tear away this paper.</i>

1233
01:15:40,119 --> 01:15:41,621
<i>If you feel like giving a big zero.</i>

1234
01:15:42,163 --> 01:15:46,000
<i>Just remember this please,
today a family has turned zero.</i>

1235
01:15:49,128 --> 01:15:52,382
[sad music in the background]

1236
01:16:08,773 --> 01:16:10,358
<i>Today, I accept my failure...</i>

1237
01:16:10,733 --> 01:16:12,610
<i>towards my family...</i>

1238
01:16:12,944 --> 01:16:14,404
<i>towards my wife...</i>

1239
01:16:14,696 --> 01:16:17,073
<i>and towards myself.</i>

1240
01:16:17,448 --> 01:16:19,075
<i>Sincerely, Prem Prakash.</i>

[indistinct chatter]

1242
01:16:42,890 --> 01:16:44,767
Why're you standing their sullen faced?

1243
01:16:44,851 --> 01:16:46,561
Go wash up and come.

1244
01:16:46,686 --> 01:16:49,314
Bride has made food. Go.
We'll eat together.

1245
01:16:49,522 --> 01:16:51,316
- [Sashi] Come. come.
- I am not hungry.

1246
01:16:51,607 --> 01:16:54,235
How come you are not hungry?
We've been waiting.

1247
01:16:54,485 --> 01:16:56,738
Your father closed the shop early today.

1248
01:16:57,155 --> 01:16:59,615
What happened?
Have you eaten already?

1249
01:17:00,992 --> 01:17:03,119
What happened? Go, wash up.

1250
01:17:03,703 --> 01:17:05,204
He's coming.

1251
01:17:06,247 --> 01:17:08,249
- Yes, give it.
- I'll say one thing.

1252
01:17:09,584 --> 01:17:12,337
- I like boiled veggies.
- You're right.

1253
01:17:12,420 --> 01:17:14,547
Spices don't help,
they just boil our blood.

1254
01:17:14,672 --> 01:17:17,091
[Sashi] Bride has taught us
such a wonderful dish today.

1255
01:17:17,175 --> 01:17:19,927
- [Naintara] What's that?
- Dal soup!

1256
01:17:20,261 --> 01:17:23,765
- Looks nice, right!
- [Sandhya] Mother, forgot to put caraway.

1257
01:17:23,973 --> 01:17:26,684
[Sandhya] Father, I shall put it tomorrow.
Will taste even better.

1258
01:17:26,768 --> 01:17:28,895
- It's fine!
- Take some more, please.

1259
01:17:29,437 --> 01:17:30,438
Take it!

1260
01:17:31,064 --> 01:17:32,106
Here.

1261
01:17:32,648 --> 01:17:35,735
Boy, you leave the cheese.
Have the green gourd.

1262
01:17:35,860 --> 01:17:37,695
- Cheese, she'll have.
- No, no, father,

1263
01:17:37,779 --> 01:17:38,946
Please give it to him.

1264
01:17:39,030 --> 01:17:41,199
We make it often at my house.
You please have.

1265
01:17:45,286 --> 01:17:47,622
You know, what I'm thinking, daughter?

1266
01:17:47,955 --> 01:17:49,540
Prem, you also listen.

1267
01:17:50,666 --> 01:17:53,419
You both should participate
in "Give in all your energy" competition.

1268
01:17:53,628 --> 01:17:56,172
- Correct!
- No, no, father.

1269
01:17:56,297 --> 01:17:58,925
I'll feel embarrassed, father,
and it'll look funny too.

1270
01:17:59,217 --> 01:18:01,803
[Sashi] What funny!

1271
01:18:02,011 --> 01:18:04,097
Your father took part, four times with me.

1272
01:18:04,263 --> 01:18:05,264
Four times?

1273
01:18:06,015 --> 01:18:08,309
Yes. But we never won.
That's a different thing.

1274
01:18:08,476 --> 01:18:09,477
[laughing]

1275
01:18:09,644 --> 01:18:13,606
This time, Prem is keen
to take part in the competition.

1276
01:18:13,898 --> 01:18:15,024
Isn't it, son?

1277
01:18:15,108 --> 01:18:16,442
Of course, mother.

1278
01:18:16,734 --> 01:18:19,445
I brought her back
for this competition only. Isn't it?

1279
01:18:20,154 --> 01:18:22,865
This guy is good at crack jokes only!

1280
01:18:24,450 --> 01:18:25,827
[vessels clanking]

1281
01:18:26,994 --> 01:18:27,995
Did you see?

1282
01:18:44,929 --> 01:18:48,724
You could've had your food peacefully.
What would it matter?

1283
01:18:51,394 --> 01:18:53,062
I can't put up an act.

1284
01:18:54,147 --> 01:18:56,482
You all are worldy-wise.

1285
01:18:57,900 --> 01:18:59,569
So you know me by now?

1286
01:19:00,361 --> 01:19:02,488
I know nothing of the house,
nothing of the world.

1287
01:19:03,489 --> 01:19:05,324
You think I'm a troublemaker?

1288
01:19:06,659 --> 01:19:07,785
Lets go out!

1289
01:19:07,869 --> 01:19:11,122
What are you doing? Stop it!

1290
01:19:12,707 --> 01:19:15,334
This is family's love. Lies everywhere!

1291
01:19:15,668 --> 01:19:19,297
- Here they're feasting.
- [indistinct]

1292
01:19:19,755 --> 01:19:22,133
- We were hungry!
- It's my mistake.

1293
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:24,343
I planned to bring her here.

1294
01:19:24,427 --> 01:19:27,346
She'll take part in the competition,
save the shop and earn as well.

1295
01:19:27,430 --> 01:19:29,974
And all abuses are for me!
Let me finish myself.

1296
01:19:30,057 --> 01:19:32,560
- [Naina] Are you crazy?
- [Chabdrabhan] What're you doing?

1297
01:19:32,685 --> 01:19:35,771
- I want to kill myself.
- [Sashi] What're you doing?

1298
01:19:36,522 --> 01:19:38,608
[chaos and indistinct chatter]

1299
01:19:38,733 --> 01:19:42,195
She is acting, she doesn't
love anybody here.

1300
01:19:42,737 --> 01:19:46,240
- Where's match box?
- [Sashi] What're you doing?

1301
01:19:46,616 --> 01:19:50,119
Sandhya, you do whatever,
do exercise, lose weight.

1302
01:19:50,203 --> 01:19:53,581
Nothing will work. If someone has to fall
in love with you, it will happen.

1303
01:19:53,748 --> 01:19:55,082
[Prem] Rest all is a show.

1304
01:19:55,166 --> 01:20:00,338
Set me on fire and have direct telecast
of me committing suicide.

1305
01:20:00,505 --> 01:20:06,511
- Where is the match box?
- [Man] Prem Prakash Tiwari? Roll no 317.

1306
01:20:07,345 --> 01:20:09,847
[Man] Prem Prakash Tiwari, Roll no 317?

1307
01:20:12,642 --> 01:20:15,061
- What happened?
- What hasn't happened?

1308
01:20:15,561 --> 01:20:17,438
Writing the English paper in Hindi.

1309
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:21,776
Prem Prakash was
planning to commit suicide.

1310
01:20:22,401 --> 01:20:23,402
Suicide?

1311
01:20:23,694 --> 01:20:26,531
Oh, no, no. All is well.

1312
01:20:39,835 --> 01:20:42,505
[sad music in the background]

1313
01:21:00,231 --> 01:21:02,108

1314

[sniffling]

1315
01:22:12,678 --> 01:22:15,848
Had the match been lit,
would you really set yourself ablaze?

1316
01:22:18,309 --> 01:22:20,519
Did you really love me a lot?

1317
01:22:21,854 --> 01:22:24,023
When did you give me a chance?

1318
01:22:24,649 --> 01:22:25,650
Neither to tell.

1319
01:22:26,651 --> 01:22:27,652
Nor to show.

1320
01:22:31,155 --> 01:22:33,324
I don't deserve to be loved by anyone.
What do do?

1321
01:22:37,578 --> 01:22:38,579
You know...

1322
01:22:40,414 --> 01:22:42,750
I was very eager to get married.

1323
01:22:43,376 --> 01:22:44,919
But no one told me.

1324
01:22:45,711 --> 01:22:47,296
What actually getting married is?

1325
01:22:48,047 --> 01:22:50,049
And did anyone tell me?

1326
01:22:50,466 --> 01:22:52,176
They told all wrong things.

1327
01:22:54,387 --> 01:22:56,097
Do take care next time.

1328
01:23:05,940 --> 01:23:09,527
If you plan to get married again,
will you invite me?

1329
01:23:10,194 --> 01:23:11,654
Who'll marry me?

1330
01:23:13,698 --> 01:23:15,866
I'll find a boy for you.

1331
01:23:16,242 --> 01:23:18,536
One who would respect you.

1332
01:23:18,744 --> 01:23:19,954
Who would take care of you.

1333
01:23:21,247 --> 01:23:23,374
That's what I thought after meeting you.

1334
01:23:34,510 --> 01:23:35,511
Really?

1335
01:23:40,391 --> 01:23:42,727
[soft music]

1336
01:23:44,270 --> 01:23:45,271
Ok, it's all right.

1337
01:23:46,272 --> 01:23:50,818
I'll find a girl for you with whom
you'll be happy to go to the market.

1338
01:23:51,569 --> 01:23:53,946
One who doesn't show off her education.

1339
01:23:54,405 --> 01:23:57,366
Where will I find a girl like this?

1340
01:23:57,616 --> 01:24:00,077
Yeah, as if boys are lining up for me!

1341
01:24:04,457 --> 01:24:06,417
[soft music]

1342
01:24:11,714 --> 01:24:13,716
[laughing sound]

1343
01:24:24,518 --> 01:24:27,396
Father, get the shop valued.

1344
01:24:28,647 --> 01:24:32,234
You go ahead and do it,
you wanted to listen to songs.

1345
01:24:33,277 --> 01:24:37,156
- Mother, aunty, I shall take your leave.
- Ok, daughter.

1346
01:24:38,073 --> 01:24:40,117
- Father, I'm going.
- Stay happy!

1347
01:24:40,743 --> 01:24:43,788
Listen, I'll come with you.

1348
01:24:53,422 --> 01:24:54,840
You see all this?

1349
01:24:55,925 --> 01:24:57,760
That's why everyone want you back.

1350
01:24:58,552 --> 01:25:00,387
To get their things done.

1351
01:25:02,014 --> 01:25:04,683
One needs a lot of
coordination for this game.

1352
01:25:05,351 --> 01:25:06,644
You are right.

1353
01:25:07,353 --> 01:25:09,480
We are far from coordination.

1354
01:25:10,022 --> 01:25:11,190
It's ok, fine!

1355
01:25:18,948 --> 01:25:20,157
Listen!

1356
01:25:20,908 --> 01:25:22,326
Best of luck!

1357
01:25:22,952 --> 01:25:24,328
Thank you.

1358
01:25:35,714 --> 01:25:38,133
[Prem] Bro, take me home.

1359
01:25:39,260 --> 01:25:41,512
- Hello.
- [Woman] Sit down, please.

1360
01:25:45,474 --> 01:25:46,976
- Sandhya Varma.
- Yes.

1361
01:25:47,268 --> 01:25:49,812
- [Man] Show me your papers.
- Yes, Sir.

1362
01:25:52,565 --> 01:25:55,901
I can't find my file.
I have brought it, though.

1363
01:25:56,193 --> 01:25:59,238
You've come for an interview
and have forgotten your file?

1364
01:25:59,321 --> 01:26:02,825
I don't know where it is?
I had brought it.

1365
01:26:02,908 --> 01:26:05,286
You ought to bring your file.

1366
01:26:05,411 --> 01:26:08,664
[indistinct chatter]

1367
01:26:11,333 --> 01:26:13,961
Hello everyone.

1368
01:26:14,336 --> 01:26:17,715
Sandhya, you had left it in the rickshaw.

1369
01:26:18,340 --> 01:26:19,884
The papers are intact?

1370
01:26:21,677 --> 01:26:23,637
[Woman] Who is he?

1371
01:26:24,138 --> 01:26:25,347
He's my husband.

1372
01:26:25,723 --> 01:26:27,433
He... your husband?

1373
01:26:27,641 --> 01:26:29,977
Yes. Here are the papers.

1374
01:26:35,858 --> 01:26:37,318
[Man] Your papers are ok.

1375
01:26:37,985 --> 01:26:39,612
- [Woman] So, you have seen it?
- Yes,

1376
01:26:40,237 --> 01:26:42,489
Sandhya, we don't have a vacancy here.

1377
01:26:43,157 --> 01:26:45,034
But we have a vacancy in Meerut.

1378
01:26:45,284 --> 01:26:49,455
If your family lets you shift there...

1379
01:26:49,538 --> 01:26:52,041
- You can join there.
- Ok.

1380
01:26:52,333 --> 01:26:54,084
I'm ok and I'll make agree.

1381
01:26:54,335 --> 01:26:55,419
You please don't worry.

1382
01:26:55,502 --> 01:26:57,880
- [Woman] You think so?
- Yes, absolutely.

1383
01:27:00,507 --> 01:27:03,344
[background sound of vehicle and song]

1384
01:27:04,803 --> 01:27:07,014
- 12 feet.
- 12 feet!

1385
01:27:07,806 --> 01:27:11,477
This shop is no good. Do something, bro.

1386
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:14,813
[Man] I've been telling you for so long
and you are deciding today.

1387
01:27:15,064 --> 01:27:17,816
He's saying now, rent out this shop.

1388
01:27:17,983 --> 01:27:20,861
- Blessings. Get an answer quickly.
- Ok

[music playing]

1392
01:28:21,463 --> 01:28:23,298
I have filled in your songs.

1393
01:28:24,550 --> 01:28:25,718
Cassette is lying there.

1394
01:28:26,385 --> 01:28:27,803
Listen to it later.

1395
01:28:31,056 --> 01:28:32,599
[door closing]

1396
01:28:34,727 --> 01:28:37,146
- Thank you.
- [Prem] It's ok.

1397
01:28:39,773 --> 01:28:41,608
Interview's result has come?

1398
01:28:43,027 --> 01:28:44,028
No.

1399
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:46,864
You'll surely get the job.

1400
01:28:47,740 --> 01:28:48,907
How do you know?

1401
01:28:49,491 --> 01:28:52,703
I... just know.

1402
01:28:58,125 --> 01:29:00,169
- May I say something?
- Yes.

1403
01:29:00,878 --> 01:29:02,921
Whenever you feel you can move out.

1404
01:29:03,505 --> 01:29:04,631
No one will stop you.

1405
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:08,552
There's nothing but ill-fate here.

1406
01:29:10,387 --> 01:29:13,640
There's no point wasting you time here.

1407
01:29:19,188 --> 01:29:23,650
- You think about your future. Ok?
- Hmm.

1408
01:29:31,700 --> 01:29:33,243
All will be good.

1409
01:29:42,628 --> 01:29:43,962
I have got the job...

1410
01:29:46,090 --> 01:29:47,257
...in Meerut.

1411
01:30:09,363 --> 01:30:11,323
You've decided to go to Meerut?

1412
01:30:14,535 --> 01:30:16,036
Who is there for me here...

1413
01:30:16,912 --> 01:30:18,288
...for whom I should stay on?

1414
01:30:21,041 --> 01:30:23,418
There aren't
many buses to Meerut from here.

1415
01:30:25,546 --> 01:30:29,508
If one really wants, one can
change 2-3 buses to visit.

1416
01:30:33,554 --> 01:30:35,139
Have you stayed alone before?

1417
01:30:35,931 --> 01:30:36,932
No.

1418
01:30:38,267 --> 01:30:40,644
But I have never left
anyone before as well.

1419
01:30:47,359 --> 01:30:49,570
[phone ringing]

1420
01:30:51,280 --> 01:30:53,115
- Hello!
- [Man] <i>Hello.</i>

1421
01:30:54,116 --> 01:30:57,578
[Man] <i>Sister, It's me,
Sidhesh, Rameshwar's brother.</i>

1422
01:31:00,164 --> 01:31:02,499
Yes. Speak up, Sidhesh.

1423
01:31:03,083 --> 01:31:05,335
How come you have called
your sister-in-law after so long?

1424
01:31:06,253 --> 01:31:08,881
[Sidhesh] <i>Sister-in-law, you!
Sorry, couldn't recognize your voice.</i>

1425
01:31:10,382 --> 01:31:14,219
<i>I have bad news.
Rameshwar brother is no more.</i>

1426
01:31:15,679 --> 01:31:19,558
<i>He had gone on pilgrimage to Amarnath,
and died in landslide.</i>

1427
01:31:20,142 --> 01:31:22,311
For me, he had died 15 years ago.

1428
01:31:23,145 --> 01:31:25,814
<i>Sister, would've been nice had
you come one last time.</i>

1429
01:31:26,064 --> 01:31:29,109
What relation do I have
with your family, tell me?

1430
01:31:29,401 --> 01:31:33,113
In so many years, did you even
come to find out about my well-being?

1431
01:31:33,447 --> 01:31:36,992
<i>Sister, I thought at least
I should inform you so...</i>

1432
01:31:37,326 --> 01:31:38,994
Who was it, what happened?

1433
01:31:39,494 --> 01:31:41,955
Sidhesh had called.

1434
01:31:43,207 --> 01:31:44,541
What was he saying?

1435
01:31:50,756 --> 01:31:53,091
Your sister is a widow now.

1436
01:31:54,384 --> 01:31:56,637
As if he had left me, married!

1437
01:32:00,682 --> 01:32:01,934
[sobbing]

1438
01:32:02,643 --> 01:32:04,353
Hello, uncle.

1439
01:32:08,232 --> 01:32:09,441
Where is Prem?

1440
01:32:10,901 --> 01:32:12,694
Aren't you participating in the race?

1441
01:32:13,237 --> 01:32:16,531
Son, you participate in our funeral, ok.

1442
01:32:17,074 --> 01:32:18,408
What happened?

1443
01:32:23,914 --> 01:32:26,625
[Sashi] It's ok, stop crying, dear.

1444
01:32:31,171 --> 01:32:33,548
- [knocking at the door]
- [Naina]Son, shall I come?

1445
01:32:34,258 --> 01:32:35,717
Yes aunty, it's open. Come in.

1446
01:32:37,678 --> 01:32:39,179
[door opening]

1447
01:32:46,728 --> 01:32:49,398
Vijay was here. He was asking
to take part in the competition.

1448
01:32:49,564 --> 01:32:50,983
Your father drove him away.

1449
01:32:51,233 --> 01:32:52,234
[sniffling]

1450
01:32:57,948 --> 01:33:00,284
Son, I never got a chance like this.

1451
01:33:02,411 --> 01:33:05,872
Never got a chance to be somebody's wife,
or settle down in life.

1452
01:33:06,081 --> 01:33:07,833
Just spent my whole life like this.

1453
01:33:14,089 --> 01:33:17,968
Till the time both of you are together,
make some memories, that's all!

1454
01:33:19,845 --> 01:33:22,180
Aunty, you know,
no one is going from our house.

1455
01:33:22,723 --> 01:33:24,099
Then what's the point of all this?

1456
01:33:24,975 --> 01:33:26,810
Everybody did what suited the point.

1457
01:33:26,893 --> 01:33:29,146
What did we achieve?
Did we get anything?

1458
01:33:30,063 --> 01:33:34,192
Try and do something without a point
just for each other.

1459
01:33:34,693 --> 01:33:37,154
Aunty, there's no point forcing anything.

1460
01:33:38,238 --> 01:33:39,948
If someone doesn't want to do it...

1461
01:33:40,073 --> 01:33:41,783
Do you want to do it?

1462
01:33:41,992 --> 01:33:45,370
When you don't want to take part
then what's the point in asking me?

1463
01:33:46,705 --> 01:33:48,832
As if we've not been embarrassed
enough before?

1464
01:33:49,750 --> 01:33:54,629
We have lost everything, Sandhya,
there's nothing left to be embarrassed.

1465
01:33:55,172 --> 01:33:58,884
Prem, if nothing is left,
at least do what your heart desires.

1466
01:34:02,596 --> 01:34:04,056
Won't be able to lift me?

1467
01:34:06,058 --> 01:34:08,894
What are you saying?

1468
01:34:10,062 --> 01:34:13,023
What do you think I did at Shakha?

1469
01:34:15,901 --> 01:34:20,072
Ok, then, shall I tell sister
to call Jaya and Hema?

1470
01:34:22,449 --> 01:34:23,450
Yes, ok.

1471
01:34:26,244 --> 01:34:28,997

1475
01:35:29,307 --> 01:35:30,809
I'll just be back.

1476
01:35:33,645 --> 01:35:34,980
Hello, uncle, greetings!

1477
01:35:35,147 --> 01:35:38,650
- You've come?
- Hello, sis-in-law, hello, aunty.

1478
01:35:38,859 --> 01:35:42,028
Come here. I have got you registered.

1479

1480
01:35:45,699 --> 01:35:49,202
- Daughter, take care, it's up to you now.
- You ok?

1481
01:35:49,786 --> 01:35:51,163
Father.

1482
01:35:54,040 --> 01:35:56,585
Here. Win and come back!

1483
01:35:56,751 --> 01:35:58,336
Don't pressurize, mother.

1484
01:35:59,045 --> 01:36:02,382
- We're participating, that's enough.
- Why do you always give up. Let's go.

1485
01:36:03,216 --> 01:36:06,720
[indistinct chatter]

1487
01:36:11,516 --> 01:36:14,895
[Shakha] Careful, don't pull your veins.

1488
01:36:15,061 --> 01:36:17,189
- You'll not able to run.
- Here he is!

1489
01:36:18,148 --> 01:36:19,816
[Nirmal] Let him come.

1490
01:36:20,317 --> 01:36:22,486
Prem, will you be able to lift your wife?

1491
01:36:22,652 --> 01:36:24,029
Or you'll need uncle's help,

1492
01:36:24,488 --> 01:36:25,989
Isn't it, Shakha sir?

1493
01:36:26,072 --> 01:36:27,324
[mocking laugh]

1494
01:36:29,117 --> 01:36:31,745
- What are you doing here?
- I don't give a damn!

1495
01:36:32,120 --> 01:36:34,122
To hell with her father
and my father too.

1496
01:36:34,289 --> 01:36:36,750
Got married in Shiv temple this morning.

1497
01:36:37,250 --> 01:36:38,710
That's great news. Congrats!

1498
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:40,295
To you too!

1499
01:36:41,421 --> 01:36:43,256
[Announcer] Ladies and Gentlemen.

1500
01:36:43,465 --> 01:36:47,552
Time has finally come, to take on your
relationships onto yourself.

1501
01:36:47,677 --> 01:36:51,223
Let's see who completes this journey.

[Announcer] I <i>t has obstacles
and hurdles also.</i>

1503
01:36:54,476 --> 01:36:58,188
Let's see, who puts in all energy
and reaches the finish line

1504
01:36:58,313 --> 01:37:02,526
and claims the prize money of Rs.10,000.

1505
01:37:02,651 --> 01:37:05,570
Friends, to inaugurate this competition,

1506
01:37:05,654 --> 01:37:10,534
we have with us, our favourite,
voice of all of us,

1507

[background song]

1524
01:39:01,645 --> 01:39:03,605
Be careful.

1525
01:39:04,314 --> 01:39:06,775
Put both the feet in one tyre
and then on the next.

1526
01:39:06,983 --> 01:39:10,987
- Is it so easy? Do yourself and see.
- Really?

1527
01:39:11,404 --> 01:39:13,198
Hold tight.

1528
01:39:23,124 --> 01:39:27,671
- Get along on the way.
- Now, take care of your Chetak!

Even you too.

1534
01:39:45,939 --> 01:39:48,900
Why are you getting involved again?
You will never listen.

1537
01:39:59,327 --> 01:40:00,704
Be careful.

1538
01:40:01,079 --> 01:40:02,580
Will you be able to do it?

1539
01:40:03,915 --> 01:40:05,667
Don't you see? I am doing.

1540
01:40:06,209 --> 01:40:09,713
- Hold tight. Don't leave.
- I am holding tight. You, look ahead.

1541
01:40:26,146 --> 01:40:28,148
- What's wrong?
- It tickles.

1542
01:40:28,648 --> 01:40:30,316
- Okay, now?
- Yes, yes.

1543
01:40:56,217 --> 01:40:57,719
Are you okay?

1544
01:40:58,511 --> 01:41:00,597
Dipti... Dipti... Dipti

1545
01:41:01,389 --> 01:41:03,600
- Come here.
- I am hurt.

1546
01:41:03,850 --> 01:41:06,644
Hurry up. Have you gone mad? Hurry up.

1547
01:41:06,728 --> 01:41:08,313
What are you doing?

Hey! What happened?

1550
01:41:15,653 --> 01:41:18,782
- What happened? Why are you laughing?
- Look at your face!

1551
01:41:19,824 --> 01:41:21,868
