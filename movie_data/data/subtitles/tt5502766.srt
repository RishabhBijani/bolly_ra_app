1
00:02:49,248 --> 00:02:50,872
What happened?

2
00:02:50,873 --> 00:02:55,873
Kanan...

3
00:03:06,207 --> 00:03:11,207
- Kanan...where are you?

4
00:03:11,457 --> 00:03:15,497
- Come here.

5
00:03:15,498 --> 00:03:20,498
- Kanan, come to me.

6
00:04:05,707 --> 00:04:06,872
- Sir...

7
00:04:06,873 --> 00:04:07,872
- Sir...

8
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:12,873
- Please wake up, Sir.

9
00:04:14,207 --> 00:04:17,372
Sir, please make
your seat back upright.

10
00:04:17,373 --> 00:04:22,373
We're about to land.

11
00:04:37,582 --> 00:04:39,372
Yes, it has landed.
- It has landed.

12
00:04:39,373 --> 00:04:41,747
Give me a minute.
I'll just speak to Usha.

13
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:46,748
"Ä°t's a massive wedding."

14
00:04:47,498 --> 00:04:50,122
- Hello? Hello, Usha.
- Yes.

15
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,456
The flight has landed. Kanan is here.

16
00:04:52,457 --> 00:04:53,831
That's great.

17
00:04:53,832 --> 00:04:56,372
Come home quickly,
we are waiting for you.

18
00:04:56,373 --> 00:04:59,831
"Nobody is allowed to sleep
or do unnecessary drama."

19
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:01,622
"No one is allowed
to receive phone calls."

20
00:05:01,623 --> 00:05:05,081
What is this, mummy?
You've started from the morning?

21
00:05:05,082 --> 00:05:06,497
Come on, it's past 9 o'clock.

22
00:05:06,498 --> 00:05:10,706
"All they have to do is embrace
this moment and dance.â€œ

23
00:05:10,707 --> 00:05:12,997
"Bottoms up, they drink alcohol
and completely empty their glasses."

24
00:05:12,998 --> 00:05:16,206
"Waists swinging,
dancing the night away."

25
00:05:16,207 --> 00:05:17,747
What is the purpose of your visit?

26
00:05:17,748 --> 00:05:20,247
Wedding... I'm getting married.

27
00:05:20,248 --> 00:05:25,248
Getting married?

28
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,122
What!! You still haven't finished?

29
00:05:34,123 --> 00:05:36,206
You've still got the face pack on?

30
00:05:36,207 --> 00:05:38,456
Kanan's flight has landed.

31
00:05:38,457 --> 00:05:39,622
Kanan is here!

32
00:05:39,623 --> 00:05:43,706
"Flowers have blossomed all around
to the sounds of hands clapping."

33
00:05:43,707 --> 00:05:45,372
"The kohl of the bride's eyes
look at the street.."

34
00:05:45,373 --> 00:05:48,997
"..as she waits for the groom to arrive."

35
00:05:48,998 --> 00:05:52,747
"Girls laugh as they dress up,
they look extremely gorgeous."

36
00:05:52,748 --> 00:05:54,456
"They should stay that happy as they are
and everyone hopes that.."

37
00:05:54,457 --> 00:05:57,872
"..no one cast's an envious eye on them."

38
00:05:57,873 --> 00:06:01,747
"Millions of wishes and
congratulatory messages, swirl in the air."

39
00:06:01,748 --> 00:06:03,622
"Everyone is singing along,
as the Shenai plays in the background."

40
00:06:03,623 --> 00:06:06,872
"..they do the Bhangra dance."

41
00:06:06,873 --> 00:06:09,456
He's here! Let's go!
- "When I ask 'What's Up?"'

42
00:06:09,457 --> 00:06:13,747
"All everyone wants to do is
get into trouble and dance."

43
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:16,247
"Bottoms up, they drink alcohol
and completely empty their glasses."

44
00:06:16,248 --> 00:06:17,622
"Waists swinging,
dancing the night away."

45
00:06:17,623 --> 00:06:18,622
Hi, Morn.

46
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:21,372
My child is here.

47
00:06:21,373 --> 00:06:23,706
Why are you crying?

48
00:06:23,707 --> 00:06:24,997
Huh?

49
00:06:24,998 --> 00:06:27,581
Was it so cold in Canada
that your emotions also froze?

50
00:06:27,582 --> 00:06:28,831
These are tears of happiness.

51
00:06:28,832 --> 00:06:31,497
I'm seeing you after three years.
Can't I even hug you?

52
00:06:31,498 --> 00:06:33,081
Let's go. It's a long drive back.

53
00:06:33,082 --> 00:06:36,622
Oh... you look so tired.
What have you done to your hair?

54
00:06:36,623 --> 00:06:37,831
Style, Ma!

55
00:06:37,832 --> 00:06:41,247
Hey, this looks so dirty,
why haven't you cleaned it properly?

56
00:06:41,248 --> 00:06:43,122
There is a wedding in the house.
Come on, get serious!

57
00:06:43,123 --> 00:06:45,206
Come on, keep this on the ground.
How will he manage alone?

58
00:06:45,207 --> 00:06:46,997
We had asked for four people,
but you've got only two.

59
00:06:46,998 --> 00:06:48,081
Are you kidding me?
- Piyush...

60
00:06:48,082 --> 00:06:51,331
Keep all these inside.
- I'll be right there. One minute.

61
00:06:51,332 --> 00:06:53,497
I have been waiting.
- Look, she's angry with me now.

62
00:06:53,498 --> 00:06:55,122
"Ironically, even sobriety is spinning
around in circles."

63
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:56,997
"Nobody is ready to lose
their stubbornness."

64
00:06:56,998 --> 00:06:58,997
"They all say that
they aren't drunk enough.."

65
00:06:58,998 --> 00:07:01,081
"..and want the glass filled up
to the brim once again."

66
00:07:01,082 --> 00:07:02,622
"When I asks 'What's Up?"'

67
00:07:02,623 --> 00:07:07,623
"All everyone wants to do is
get into trouble and dance."

68
00:07:07,957 --> 00:07:09,956
"Bottoms up, they drink alcohol
and completely empty their glasses."

69
00:07:09,957 --> 00:07:14,957
"Waists swinging,
dancing the night away."

70
00:07:15,498 --> 00:07:16,997
"When I asks 'What's Up?"'

71
00:07:16,998 --> 00:07:21,998
"All everyone wants to do is
get into trouble and dance."

72
00:07:45,373 --> 00:07:47,247
Where's 'L'?

73
00:07:47,248 --> 00:07:49,247
Nikhil!
- Where is he?

74
00:07:49,248 --> 00:07:50,622
- He'll embarrass us again.

75
00:07:50,623 --> 00:07:52,581
He'll ruin all our plans.

76
00:07:52,582 --> 00:07:53,622
I for Lazy.

77
00:07:53,623 --> 00:07:55,497
The groom has arrived!

78
00:07:55,498 --> 00:07:57,872
He's here!

79
00:07:57,873 --> 00:07:59,872
He always does this.
- Calm down.

80
00:07:59,873 --> 00:08:04,873
How many times do I tell him!

81
00:08:10,123 --> 00:08:12,872
- The groom has arrived!

82
00:08:12,873 --> 00:08:16,456
Welcome! Welcome!

83
00:08:16,457 --> 00:08:20,122
- How is everything?

84
00:08:20,123 --> 00:08:21,372
- Congratulations!

85
00:08:21,373 --> 00:08:24,247
- Welcome, Kanan!!!

86
00:08:24,248 --> 00:08:29,206
- Welcome!

87
00:08:29,207 --> 00:08:32,622
- Hello, how are you!

88
00:08:32,623 --> 00:08:35,331
Wassup dude!
- Wassup!

89
00:08:35,332 --> 00:08:36,706
I'll tell you wassup!

90
00:08:36,707 --> 00:08:38,622
Where were you? I for Loafer.

91
00:08:38,623 --> 00:08:41,372
The priest wants to know,
when will you all meet him?

92
00:08:41,373 --> 00:08:42,497
He has to go somewhere else.

93
00:08:42,498 --> 00:08:44,497
Everybody here has had a drink.

94
00:08:44,498 --> 00:08:46,872
Usha, you don't drink.
You handle this.

95
00:08:46,873 --> 00:08:49,206
He's asking for grandma.

96
00:08:49,207 --> 00:08:51,247
He can ask all he likes.

97
00:08:51,248 --> 00:08:53,747
He is not going to
get a straight answer.

98
00:08:53,748 --> 00:08:55,997
I have been drinking since morning.

99
00:08:55,998 --> 00:08:58,122
Let's all go. He won't notice.

100
00:08:58,123 --> 00:09:00,997
We have to go and tell them about it.
- Yes.

101
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:05,998
Tell them what?

102
00:09:24,498 --> 00:09:29,247
You're...you're joking, right?

103
00:09:29,248 --> 00:09:31,747
It's funny, but it's not a joke.

104
00:09:31,748 --> 00:09:34,122
A movie star had also done it.

105
00:09:34,123 --> 00:09:35,997
I had read it in the local newspaper.

106
00:09:35,998 --> 00:09:38,747
Who believes in these
superstitions nowadays?

107
00:09:38,748 --> 00:09:40,497
- It's up to you.

108
00:09:40,498 --> 00:09:42,997
You had asked for his horoscope.

109
00:09:42,998 --> 00:09:47,581
I'm only suggesting a
solution to the problem.

110
00:09:47,582 --> 00:09:49,581
Some brown people crap man!

111
00:09:49,582 --> 00:09:51,122
Who's brown here?

112
00:09:51,123 --> 00:09:55,622
Everybody in the family
is nice and fair.

113
00:09:55,623 --> 00:09:57,997
Son, since this is for Anu,
why don't you do it?

114
00:09:57,998 --> 00:09:59,997
Since this is for Anu,
why doesn't she do it?

115
00:09:59,998 --> 00:10:02,331
But you are the one born
under a cursed star.

116
00:10:02,332 --> 00:10:04,247
So, you are the one
who has to get married.

117
00:10:04,248 --> 00:10:06,497
Yes, sir...to a tree?

118
00:10:06,498 --> 00:10:08,747
Isn't it enough that I'm marrying Anu?

119
00:10:08,748 --> 00:10:10,331
Now I have to marry a tree as well?

120
00:10:10,332 --> 00:10:11,956
- What difference does it make, son?

121
00:10:11,957 --> 00:10:13,581
Think of it as a joke.

122
00:10:13,582 --> 00:10:16,581
It's just a small ritual,
let's get it over with and move ahead.

123
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:18,622
- Okay, enough of this
serious discussion.

124
00:10:18,623 --> 00:10:21,872
- Michie, let's go have a drink.

125
00:10:21,873 --> 00:10:23,872
- Mummy, what is this...
- Let's go.

126
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:28,873
- So what can I get you?

127
00:10:35,623 --> 00:10:38,122
Technology has advanced so much...

128
00:10:38,123 --> 00:10:42,456
and you're still listening
to these old records?

129
00:10:42,457 --> 00:10:46,372
I like them. You can play
something else, if you want to.

130
00:10:46,373 --> 00:10:49,456
Why play anything else?
Kanan will sing for us.

131
00:10:49,457 --> 00:10:51,747
Kanan!

132
00:10:51,748 --> 00:10:53,122
What?

133
00:10:53,123 --> 00:10:54,122
- Come on, come on.

134
00:10:54,123 --> 00:10:57,831
Let us also listen to what he's
rapping about in Canada.

135
00:10:57,832 --> 00:11:00,331
- Come on son, sing.

136
00:11:00,332 --> 00:11:05,332
Sing for us.

137
00:11:22,498 --> 00:11:25,581
Okay, enough!

138
00:11:25,582 --> 00:11:26,997
Forget about him,
I will sing for you.

139
00:11:26,998 --> 00:11:31,998
No need. Two pegs down
and he thinks he is Honey Singh.

140
00:11:33,707 --> 00:11:37,247
That's alright. He's just singing.

141
00:11:37,248 --> 00:11:42,248
Anu's grandfather would go
wild after a couple of drinks.

142
00:11:44,248 --> 00:11:47,831
Once, at somebody else's house...

143
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:52,832
he asked the way to their
bedroom and took me inside.

144
00:11:54,248 --> 00:11:57,747
He had so much energy, I swear!

145
00:11:57,748 --> 00:11:59,372
Mummy...

146
00:11:59,373 --> 00:12:01,206
What is it?

147
00:12:01,207 --> 00:12:03,081
- Don't get uppity-

148
00:12:03,082 --> 00:12:07,247
You're also the result of
one such incident.

149
00:12:07,248 --> 00:12:12,248
- Fantastic!

150
00:13:12,373 --> 00:13:15,247
Is everything alright?

151
00:13:15,248 --> 00:13:17,372
What is this new thing
you've started?

152
00:13:17,373 --> 00:13:19,331
It's cool, man.

153
00:13:19,332 --> 00:13:21,706
You have always been cool, baby.

154
00:13:21,707 --> 00:13:23,706
Why do you need to do all this?

155
00:13:23,707 --> 00:13:26,497
Anu, don't irritate me, please.

156
00:13:26,498 --> 00:13:30,456
Okay, sorry.

157
00:13:30,457 --> 00:13:33,081
Do you know the wedding
is fixed for Baisakhi?

158
00:13:33,082 --> 00:13:35,622
Grandma says it's a
very auspicious day.

159
00:13:35,623 --> 00:13:40,623
For which wedding?
The one with the tree?

160
00:13:44,498 --> 00:13:47,997
By the way, what were you
saying in the morning?

161
00:13:47,998 --> 00:13:49,622
About?

162
00:13:49,623 --> 00:13:51,747
Isn't it enough that
I'm marrying Anu?

163
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:55,581
Dude, I was angry. I'm supposed to
marry a tree? Seriously?

164
00:13:55,582 --> 00:14:00,497
So what? I'll be the second wife.

165
00:14:00,498 --> 00:14:05,498
And the second wife always
has more fun than the first.

166
00:14:08,623 --> 00:14:13,623
What happened, baby?

167
00:14:16,207 --> 00:14:18,622
Isn't everything happening too fast?

168
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:21,497
We've been seeing each
other since high school.

169
00:14:21,498 --> 00:14:24,372
How much more time do you need?

170
00:14:24,373 --> 00:14:26,997
Don't you need more time?

171
00:14:26,998 --> 00:14:31,998
Don't be silly, I've been
waiting for this day forever.

172
00:14:32,873 --> 00:14:37,497
I don't even know what I'm doing
next month. Forget about forever.

173
00:14:37,498 --> 00:14:42,372
Whatever you'll be doing,
it will be with me, right?

174
00:14:42,373 --> 00:14:44,956
What's the guarantee?

175
00:14:44,957 --> 00:14:47,206
What do you mean?

176
00:14:47,207 --> 00:14:50,747
Nothing.

177
00:14:50,748 --> 00:14:55,748
Are you seeing somebody else?

178
00:14:56,248 --> 00:14:59,497
Tell me, Kanan.

179
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:03,372
Don't you want to marry me?

180
00:15:03,373 --> 00:15:05,372
What are you doing, Kanan?

181
00:15:05,373 --> 00:15:07,747
We're getting married in five days.

182
00:15:07,748 --> 00:15:10,122
Everything is fixed now.
- Chill, Anu chill.

183
00:15:10,123 --> 00:15:15,123
I know that everything is fixed.
What's the problem?

184
00:15:20,748 --> 00:15:23,247
You're marrying me, right?

185
00:15:23,248 --> 00:15:27,497
Yes, I am. Who else will I marry?

186
00:15:27,498 --> 00:15:32,456
So how does it make a difference
if we get married now or later?

187
00:15:32,457 --> 00:15:36,122
I can't keep waiting for you to
be in the right frame of mind.

188
00:15:36,123 --> 00:15:41,123
That's true.

189
00:15:44,373 --> 00:15:49,373
So...you're happy, right?

190
00:16:07,998 --> 00:16:12,998
- According to your horoscope
if you don't marry a tree first...

191
00:16:15,248 --> 00:16:19,872
...something terrible will
happen after your marriage.

192
00:16:19,873 --> 00:16:23,747
- Such as... both of you can fall ill.

193
00:16:23,748 --> 00:16:26,372
Your career might get ruined.

194
00:16:26,373 --> 00:16:29,247
But this won't happen now.

195
00:16:29,248 --> 00:16:34,248
- After marrying the tree all
your problems will be sorted.

196
00:16:35,873 --> 00:16:40,747
- And you'll lead a comfortable life.

197
00:16:40,748 --> 00:16:43,706
Let us start the ceremony.

Oh, selfie time!

Come here, son.

Come and sit.

Bheem Singh, you can
cut down the tree now.

209
00:19:20,457 --> 00:19:25,457
Excuse me!

210
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:30,873
Can you hear me?

211
00:19:49,623 --> 00:19:54,623
Hello...

212
00:21:16,498 --> 00:21:19,331
Kanan! Kanan!

213
00:21:19,332 --> 00:21:24,332
What happened, son?

214
00:21:25,623 --> 00:21:27,622
- What are you saying?
- There is no one here.

215
00:21:27,623 --> 00:21:28,872
- There's nothing there.

216
00:21:28,873 --> 00:21:31,372
There is! I was lifted up.
I saw her.

217
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:33,247
You must've had a nightmare, my dear.

218
00:21:33,248 --> 00:21:35,747
No, no. It wasn't a dream.
It wasn't a dream.

219
00:21:35,748 --> 00:21:37,122
Dolly, handle it.

220
00:21:37,123 --> 00:21:38,581
Come on, let's go.
- Yes, let's go.

221
00:21:38,582 --> 00:21:40,872
- There's nothing to worry about.
- Let's go.

222
00:21:40,873 --> 00:21:42,497
- You got us worried for nothing.

223
00:21:42,498 --> 00:21:45,997
Don't worry, go to sleep.

224
00:21:45,998 --> 00:21:48,122
Are you scared?
Do you want me to sleep with you?

225
00:21:48,123 --> 00:21:49,956
No, no...

226
00:21:49,957 --> 00:21:54,957
Oh my baby got scared.

227
00:22:02,582 --> 00:22:07,582
It's all because of that, isn't it?
- What?

228
00:22:10,248 --> 00:22:15,122
Should I tell uncle and aunty?

229
00:22:15,123 --> 00:22:16,372
No...Anu!

230
00:22:16,373 --> 00:22:18,247
Anu! Please stop, please.

231
00:22:18,248 --> 00:22:19,997
Stop all this nonsense.

232
00:22:19,998 --> 00:22:23,206
This shouldn't be causing it.
- But it is.

233
00:22:23,207 --> 00:22:26,622
Maybe it was a BT.

234
00:22:26,623 --> 00:22:29,581
A bad trip.

235
00:22:29,582 --> 00:22:32,372
Come on, forget it.
Now go to sleep. Okay?

236
00:22:32,373 --> 00:22:33,747
Good night.

237
00:22:33,748 --> 00:22:38,748
Good night.

Anu!
- What happened?

241
00:22:49,123 --> 00:22:51,997
Er...dude, I think I'm
still having a bad trip.

242
00:22:51,998 --> 00:22:53,706
Can I sleep with you?
- No way!

243
00:22:53,707 --> 00:22:55,997
Please, please, please.

244
00:22:55,998 --> 00:22:58,122
Don't try to pull any stunts at night.

245
00:22:58,123 --> 00:22:59,122
What?

246
00:22:59,123 --> 00:23:00,081
You know...

247
00:23:00,082 --> 00:23:02,456
Nothing will happen between
us before we get married.

248
00:23:02,457 --> 00:23:05,247
Dude, are you crazy?
I couldn't even if I wanted to...

249
00:23:05,248 --> 00:23:06,831
Nothing is gonna happen.

250
00:23:06,832 --> 00:23:08,122
This is all a result of that.

251
00:23:08,123 --> 00:23:10,497
What if you can't,
even after marriage?

252
00:23:10,498 --> 00:23:15,498
It's nothing like that, okay? I...

253
00:24:17,123 --> 00:24:22,123
"Oh shoot, I saw a ghost."

254
00:24:22,332 --> 00:24:27,332
"Oh shoot, I saw a ghost."

255
00:25:44,998 --> 00:25:46,997
Sir...

256
00:25:46,998 --> 00:25:49,122
Ah!

257
00:25:49,123 --> 00:25:51,081
Sir, don't!
- You?

258
00:25:51,082 --> 00:25:53,122
Sir, stop!

259
00:25:53,123 --> 00:25:55,872
Hey there!
Listen...

260
00:25:55,873 --> 00:25:58,122
Noooo!

261
00:25:58,123 --> 00:25:59,747
Sir!

262
00:25:59,748 --> 00:26:03,372
Sir! Noooo!

00:26:03,373 --> 00:26:08,373
Ma'am!!!!!

264
00:26:08,498 --> 00:26:13,498
Ma'am!!!!!

265
00:26:24,707 --> 00:26:28,372
Kanan, what's wrong with you?
You're still in your boxers?

266
00:26:28,373 --> 00:26:30,247
I've got the fright of my life
and you're worried about my boxers?

267
00:26:30,248 --> 00:26:31,706
What?

268
00:26:31,707 --> 00:26:34,122
What's your problem?
What's wrong with my boxers?

269
00:26:34,123 --> 00:26:35,497
Problem?

270
00:26:35,498 --> 00:26:37,872
Don't you have to get dressed?

271
00:26:37,873 --> 00:26:39,497
Dressed?

272
00:26:39,498 --> 00:26:42,872
Won't you change your clothes?

273
00:26:42,873 --> 00:26:43,872
Clothes?

274
00:26:43,873 --> 00:26:46,122
Kanan, quickly go downstairs
and change your clothes.

275
00:26:46,123 --> 00:26:48,372
The guests have started arriving
for the engagement ceremony.

276
00:26:48,373 --> 00:26:51,331
I don't want to go. I'm fine like this.
I'll wear some of daddy's clothes.

277
00:26:51,332 --> 00:26:54,122
Eh, Kanan, stop talking rubbish.

278
00:26:54,123 --> 00:26:54,997
Go downstairs.

279
00:26:54,998 --> 00:26:57,331
Do whatever you want to,
I'm not going downstairs.

280
00:26:57,332 --> 00:26:59,581
Kanan, do you want me to slap you?

281
00:26:59,582 --> 00:27:00,872
Go downstairs and change your clothes.

282
00:27:00,873 --> 00:27:02,747
Send somebody else instead, please.

283
00:27:02,748 --> 00:27:06,497
Wait, just you wait.

284
00:27:06,498 --> 00:27:09,122
<i>'</i> Piyush!
<i>'</i> Yes?

285
00:27:09,123 --> 00:27:10,122
Piyush!
- Yes, aunty?

286
00:27:10,123 --> 00:27:12,247
Go to Kanan's room and...
- No!

287
00:27:12,248 --> 00:27:13,581
No?

288
00:27:13,582 --> 00:27:15,581
I don't want to go to his room.

289
00:27:15,582 --> 00:27:17,081
Why?

290
00:27:17,082 --> 00:27:17,997
I'm scared.

291
00:27:17,998 --> 00:27:19,622
Scared? Who are you scared of?

292
00:27:19,623 --> 00:27:21,747
He...

293

What... what can I say, aunty?

294
00:27:24,998 --> 00:27:27,956
You won't be able to
handle the truth.

295
00:27:27,957 --> 00:27:31,206
Shut up! Just go to his room
and get his suit.

296
00:27:31,207 --> 00:27:32,997
- He's waiting upstairs.

297
00:27:32,998 --> 00:27:33,956
He's waiting upstairs?

298
00:27:33,957 --> 00:27:35,247
- Yes.

299
00:27:35,248 --> 00:27:37,247
He isn't downstairs?
- No.

300
00:27:37,248 --> 00:27:38,497
Of course, I'll get it.

301
00:27:38,498 --> 00:27:40,372
Why didn't you tell me
he's upstairs?

302
00:27:40,373 --> 00:27:44,247
- I... okay then,
he's not in his room.

303
00:27:44,248 --> 00:27:47,456
What's going on?

304
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:51,622
How are you, Kanan?

305
00:27:51,623 --> 00:27:53,206
You too?

306
00:27:53,207 --> 00:27:56,122
Both father and son
are driving me insane.

307
00:27:56,123 --> 00:28:00,122
Okay, come like this,
come in your underwear.

308
00:28:00,123 --> 00:28:02,122
Come naked for all I care.

309
00:28:02,123 --> 00:28:07,123
What's it to me?

310
00:28:18,998 --> 00:28:23,998
Yes Piyush, come in, come in.

311
00:28:30,623 --> 00:28:35,623
Ah!

312
00:29:00,707 --> 00:29:05,707
Ah!

313
00:29:33,373 --> 00:29:36,872
This can't be happening.

314
00:29:36,873 --> 00:29:41,873
But it is.

315
00:29:42,873 --> 00:29:46,831
Who are you?

316
00:29:46,832 --> 00:29:50,122
I'm stuck here from last night.

317
00:29:50,123 --> 00:29:52,706
Who are you?
Why have you got me here?

318
00:29:52,707 --> 00:29:54,747
I...I... why would I get you here?

319
00:29:54,748 --> 00:29:57,581
How do I know?
That's why I'm asking you.

320
00:29:57,582 --> 00:29:59,372
You're driving me crazy.

321
00:29:59,373 --> 00:30:01,622
You faint, you run away...

322
00:30:01,623 --> 00:30:03,872
Tell me, why have you got me here?

323
00:30:03,873 --> 00:30:05,497
Why am I here?

324
00:30:05,498 --> 00:30:06,497
What have you done?

325
00:30:06,498 --> 00:30:08,372
I...l didn't do anything.

326
00:30:08,373 --> 00:30:12,997
Don't lie to me.
- I...I...I didn't. I just woke up.

327
00:30:12,998 --> 00:30:17,997
And you...you were there.
- I know, but what did you do before that?

328
00:30:17,998 --> 00:30:19,872
I went into my room and slept?

329
00:30:19,873 --> 00:30:24,873
Idiot, what did you do before that?

330
00:30:24,998 --> 00:30:27,622
I had gone to that tree.

331
00:30:27,623 --> 00:30:30,747
Tree!

332
00:30:30,748 --> 00:30:35,748
- 'After marrying the tree
all your problems will be sorted.'

333
00:30:36,373 --> 00:30:41,206
- 'The ceremony is now complete.'

334
00:30:41,207 --> 00:30:46,207
- Kanan.

335
00:30:48,707 --> 00:30:52,581
What are you doing?

336
00:30:52,582 --> 00:30:57,331
You're...you're a ghost.
I'm scared.

337
00:30:57,332 --> 00:31:00,872
Okay.

338
00:31:00,873 --> 00:31:02,331
Take me back.

339
00:31:02,332 --> 00:31:04,372
Wh...where?
- To the tree.

340
00:31:04,373 --> 00:31:08,497
The tree...tree isn't there anymore.

341
00:31:08,498 --> 00:31:12,331
What do you mean?

342
00:31:12,332 --> 00:31:14,747
It has been cut down.

343
00:31:14,748 --> 00:31:17,247
Why?

344
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:20,206
I'm born under a cursed star...
- So?

345
00:31:20,207 --> 00:31:25,207
So they cut down the tree
after I got married to it.

346
00:31:33,123 --> 00:31:36,581
So that's why I'm here.

347
00:31:36,582 --> 00:31:38,872
Why?

348
00:31:38,873 --> 00:31:42,122
You don't marry a tree,
you marry a girl.

349
00:31:42,123 --> 00:31:46,247
And there was only one girl there... me.

350
00:31:46,248 --> 00:31:49,831
You didn't marry the tree.
You married me.

351
00:31:49,832 --> 00:31:54,832
- Hey Kanan...

352
00:31:54,957 --> 00:31:59,957
- Kanan?

353
00:32:04,957 --> 00:32:06,956
Kanan?

354
00:32:06,957 --> 00:32:08,372
What happened, my dear?

355
00:32:08,373 --> 00:32:10,497
Huh?

356
00:32:10,498 --> 00:32:13,956
You had a bath with your clothes on?

357
00:32:13,957 --> 00:32:17,372
What...?

358
00:32:17,373 --> 00:32:22,373
You...
- Namaste. Namaste...

359
00:32:40,998 --> 00:32:43,706
Whoa, whoa!

360
00:32:43,707 --> 00:32:44,997
How old are you?

361
00:32:44,998 --> 00:32:49,372
I, ... 26?

362
00:32:49,373 --> 00:32:54,373
What?
- 26?

363
00:32:59,123 --> 00:33:02,497
That's a long time to wait.

364
00:33:02,498 --> 00:33:06,872
For what?

365
00:33:06,873 --> 00:33:08,247
For you to die.

366
00:33:08,248 --> 00:33:10,456
'I....I...I......

367
00:33:10,457 --> 00:33:12,956
'I...I...I......

368
00:33:12,957 --> 00:33:15,497
Why do I have to die?

369
00:33:15,498 --> 00:33:17,456
Death is inevitable.
For everyone.

370
00:33:17,457 --> 00:33:21,497
And I can be free only
on your death.

371
00:33:21,498 --> 00:33:23,872
It's not like I can
do any more dying.

372
00:33:23,873 --> 00:33:28,622
So, for me to get rid of you,
I...I'll have to kill myself?

373
00:33:28,623 --> 00:33:33,623
Stop talking nonsense.

374
00:33:33,957 --> 00:33:36,997
You will die when it is your time.

375
00:33:36,998 --> 00:33:38,997
You could have an accident.

376
00:33:38,998 --> 00:33:43,206
Or I...l could even live to be a 100.

377
00:33:43,207 --> 00:33:45,081
Please don't say that.

378
00:33:45,082 --> 00:33:47,497
I hope that you die soon
so that I am free of you.

379
00:33:47,498 --> 00:33:49,956
Here I'm the one who
is saddled with a ghost.

380
00:33:49,957 --> 00:33:50,997
You want to get rid of me?

381
00:33:50,998 --> 00:33:53,456
Yes, but you are
the one who married me.

382
00:33:53,457 --> 00:33:55,706
But...but I didn't do it on purpose.

383
00:33:55,707 --> 00:34:00,081
I'm not exactly having a party here.

384
00:34:00,082 --> 00:34:03,997
I agree I've made a mistake, but is
there no way out? Apart from me dying?

385
00:34:03,998 --> 00:34:07,331
Can't you just go?

386
00:34:07,332 --> 00:34:08,581
Where?

387
00:34:08,582 --> 00:34:11,747
You have cut down the tree.

388
00:34:11,748 --> 00:34:16,247
So...you...you...

389
00:34:16,248 --> 00:34:18,747
Were you alive before you died?

390
00:34:18,748 --> 00:34:21,747
No, no. I was born a ghost.

391
00:34:21,748 --> 00:34:22,622
What?

392
00:34:22,623 --> 00:34:27,623
What! Are you daft?

393
00:34:27,873 --> 00:34:32,873
So didn't you have a home,
why don't you go there?

394
00:34:33,582 --> 00:34:38,582
Home...

395
00:35:29,248 --> 00:35:33,122
Here... one minute.

396
00:35:33,123 --> 00:35:36,372
Take a deep breath.

397
00:35:36,373 --> 00:35:37,956
- Once more.

398
00:35:37,957 --> 00:35:42,957
Hello, brother.

399
00:35:53,748 --> 00:35:55,456
What's the problem?

400
00:35:55,457 --> 00:35:57,206
Oh, my heart.

401
00:35:57,207 --> 00:35:59,622
Should I ask brother
to give you some medicine?

402
00:35:59,623 --> 00:36:02,456
Shut up, you idiot.
I don't need medicine.

403
00:36:02,457 --> 00:36:07,457
Then, what's the matter?

404
00:36:24,498 --> 00:36:27,997
Is it there?
- Yes, it is.

405
00:36:27,998 --> 00:36:30,372
You keep saying you
don't like Phillauri.

406
00:36:30,373 --> 00:36:33,497
- But you look forward to
reading his poems every Monday.

407
00:36:33,498 --> 00:36:36,872
Our village is called Phillaur
so all of us are Phillauris.

408
00:36:36,873 --> 00:36:39,081
So, how can you say that
this was written by that fool?

409
00:36:39,082 --> 00:36:41,456
You...you don't call him names.

410
00:36:41,457 --> 00:36:43,872
Everybody knows that he's
the only one who is so talented.

411
00:36:43,873 --> 00:36:47,706
Oh!

412
00:36:47,707 --> 00:36:50,872
Oh my, do you want
him all to yourself?

413
00:36:50,873 --> 00:36:52,581
You won't be able to handle it.

414
00:36:52,582 --> 00:36:57,582
Please read it.

415
00:36:58,957 --> 00:37:03,957
"An unfolding.
Like an unfurling of wings..."

416
00:37:06,623 --> 00:37:08,997
"Love flies in."

417
00:37:08,998 --> 00:37:13,998
"Disruptive. Breaking the dawn...
With the edge of it's beak."

418
00:37:16,123 --> 00:37:19,372
"I have coaxed it to stay."

419
00:37:19,373 --> 00:37:22,997
"Fattened on sugar drops,
From the tip of my tongue."

420
00:37:22,998 --> 00:37:27,456
"I am hoping it will murmur my name."

421
00:37:27,457 --> 00:37:29,997
"Remember me in bird song."

422
00:37:29,998 --> 00:37:34,122
"They say it pierces it's heart,
On the thorns of roses."

423
00:37:34,123 --> 00:37:37,872
"And blood blossoms,
As eternal spring."

424
00:37:37,873 --> 00:37:41,872
"They say it will build
a thorny nest..."

425
00:37:41,873 --> 00:37:46,873
"...And have you rock-a-bye,
On a lullaby of sighs."

426
00:37:47,332 --> 00:37:47,872
-"And when..."

427
00:37:47,873 --> 00:37:51,247
"...every second
will pass like an eon."

428
00:37:51,248 --> 00:37:56,248
"And your soul burns and
dies in autumn fall."

429
00:37:58,582 --> 00:38:02,747
"it will move on.
Sing another song."

430
00:38:02,748 --> 00:38:04,497
"At another door.
Coax another heart."

431
00:38:04,498 --> 00:38:07,247
"lnto a trap of its own making."

432
00:38:07,248 --> 00:38:09,831
Phillauri.

433
00:38:09,832 --> 00:38:11,247
Great.

434
00:38:11,248 --> 00:38:14,497
You write so well, brother.

435
00:38:14,498 --> 00:38:17,747
Oh forget it, Soma.
What's the point?

436
00:38:17,748 --> 00:38:20,997
I won't even get enough
money to buy some liquor.

437
00:38:20,998 --> 00:38:22,456
You're right.

438
00:38:22,457 --> 00:38:24,247
Come on Phillauri, sing!

439
00:38:24,248 --> 00:38:29,248
- Come on Phillauri, sing!

440
00:38:57,957 --> 00:38:58,956
- Phillauri!!!

441
00:38:58,957 --> 00:39:00,372
Hello everyone...

442
00:39:00,373 --> 00:39:01,956
How are you doing?

443
00:39:01,957 --> 00:39:03,622
Are you ready for some fun?

444
00:39:03,623 --> 00:39:05,372
Let me tell you a story.

445
00:39:05,373 --> 00:39:07,331
It so happened...

446
00:39:07,332 --> 00:39:09,456
...that I got into a spot
of trouble for no fault of mine.

447
00:39:09,457 --> 00:39:11,747
You all know everyone
sings my praises.

448
00:39:11,748 --> 00:39:16,748
You are well aware
what a gentleman I am.

449
00:39:28,748 --> 00:39:33,706
"There was a house with high walls
where well-bred and innocent people lived."

450
00:39:33,707 --> 00:39:38,581
"There was a girl hiding inside it
but the windows were open."

451
00:39:38,582 --> 00:39:43,456
"There was a house with high walls
where well-bred and innocent people lived."

452
00:39:43,457 --> 00:39:47,997
"There was a girl hiding inside it
but the windows were open."

453
00:39:47,998 --> 00:39:49,372
- What happened after that?

454
00:39:49,373 --> 00:39:54,373
"He's got a silky kurti with
Phillauri written all over it."

455
00:39:55,207 --> 00:39:58,956
"Playing his Tumba
for all the village girls."

456
00:39:58,957 --> 00:40:03,956
"He sings and dances as he plays
music for them, all for Phillauri."

457
00:40:03,957 --> 00:40:08,957
"He sings and dances as he plays
music for them, all for Phillauri."

458
00:40:44,957 --> 00:40:49,872
"Listen to my tales because
it has knowledgeable things."

459
00:40:49,873 --> 00:40:52,372
I attempts to capture the attention of
all the women around."

460
00:40:52,373 --> 00:40:54,747
"Like a pigeon that spots seeds to eat."

461
00:40:54,748 --> 00:40:57,206
"I tells everyone to let go of
any fake shame or modesty.."

462
00:40:57,207 --> 00:40:59,622
"..l doesn't want them to pretend
like embarrassed."

463
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:02,122
"Just like a cat that drinks up
all the milk.."

464
00:41:02,123 --> 00:41:03,872
"..and then wipes its moustache."

465
00:41:03,873 --> 00:41:08,622
"There is no need for anyone to ask
what happened next."

466
00:41:08,623 --> 00:41:11,872
"When both are agree to be
in each other's company.."

467
00:41:11,873 --> 00:41:16,456
"..there is no deceit or lying
in the relationship."

468
00:41:16,457 --> 00:41:21,331
"Behind an extremely dark veil,
I spotted a fair lady's face."

469
00:41:21,332 --> 00:41:25,872
"She had a husband from
foreign shores, who was a little deaf."

470
00:41:25,873 --> 00:41:27,331
- What happened after that?

471
00:41:27,332 --> 00:41:29,622
"When the woman was
coming to terms with.."

472
00:41:29,623 --> 00:41:32,122
"..the rural and rustic
environment of Phillaur."

473
00:41:32,123 --> 00:41:35,706
"Playing his Tumba
for all the village girls."

474
00:41:35,707 --> 00:41:40,706
"He sings and dances as he plays
music for them, all for Phillauri."

475
00:41:40,707 --> 00:41:45,707
"He sings and dances as he plays
music for them, all for Phillauri."

476
00:42:07,332 --> 00:42:11,122
"There is no need for anyone to ask
what happened next."

477
00:42:11,123 --> 00:42:13,497
"When both are agree to be
in each other's company.."

478
00:42:13,498 --> 00:42:15,247
"..there is no deceit or lying
in the relationship."

479
00:42:15,248 --> 00:42:20,248
"There is no need for anyone to ask
what happened next."

480
00:42:32,748 --> 00:42:34,747
- Where are the...
- What's going on?

481
00:42:34,748 --> 00:42:37,497
Huh?
- Wh...what is going on?

482
00:42:37,498 --> 00:42:40,456
I'm getting engaged.

483
00:42:40,457 --> 00:42:42,247
En...engagement.

484
00:42:42,248 --> 00:42:44,372
What's that?
- I'm getting engaged.

485
00:42:44,373 --> 00:42:45,747
I've been telling you since morning...

486
00:42:45,748 --> 00:42:48,206
And you've realized it now?

487
00:42:48,207 --> 00:42:48,706
Since morning...

488
00:42:48,707 --> 00:42:52,747
Who is getting engaged? YOU?
- Yes.

489
00:42:52,748 --> 00:42:55,581
You've ruined my life
by marrying me.

490
00:42:55,582 --> 00:42:57,997
Whose turn is it now?
- Please, please, be quiet.

491
00:42:57,998 --> 00:43:00,997
Please.
- Why? Why should I be quiet? Huh?

492
00:43:00,998 --> 00:43:03,456
Are you okay?

493
00:43:03,457 --> 00:43:05,622
Yes.

494
00:43:05,623 --> 00:43:10,122
What's wrong with him today?

495
00:43:10,123 --> 00:43:13,872
"The auspicious day has come."

496
00:43:13,873 --> 00:43:18,873
"Come my friends
the house has been decorated."

497
00:43:22,082 --> 00:43:27,082
"I have met my love
and congratulate me on my love."

498
00:43:30,373 --> 00:43:35,373
"My lover will come and take me,
the house has been decorated."

499
00:43:41,373 --> 00:43:44,372
She's here.
- Who's here?

500
00:43:44,373 --> 00:43:45,997
Anu.

501
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:49,247
Who?
- Anu.

502
00:43:49,248 --> 00:43:54,248
"I have met my love."

503
00:44:00,957 --> 00:44:03,706
How do I look?

504
00:44:03,707 --> 00:44:04,872
She is naked?

505
00:44:04,873 --> 00:44:06,956
Naked!

506
00:44:06,957 --> 00:44:09,622
She is naked!

507
00:44:09,623 --> 00:44:10,581
Naked?

508
00:44:10,582 --> 00:44:12,831
No. No...no...

509
00:44:12,832 --> 00:44:15,497
No. It's a song.

510
00:44:15,498 --> 00:44:19,331
I've composed a new song.

511
00:44:19,332 --> 00:44:21,497
"You are naked but so nice..."

512
00:44:21,498 --> 00:44:24,706
"The world's naked in my eyes."

513
00:44:24,707 --> 00:44:25,956
What is wrong, Kanan?

514
00:44:25,957 --> 00:44:27,122
Why isn't she wearing clothes?

515
00:44:27,123 --> 00:44:32,123
What are you doing?
- Kanan, put this ring on.

516
00:44:49,457 --> 00:44:54,372
- Come on.

517
00:44:54,373 --> 00:44:57,206
Here.

518
00:44:57,207 --> 00:45:01,997
- Beautiful couple.

519
00:45:01,998 --> 00:45:06,998
Congratulations.

520
00:45:12,248 --> 00:45:14,081
- Wassup, everyone!

521
00:45:14,082 --> 00:45:16,956
The boy from Canada
and the girl from Punjab...

522
00:45:16,957 --> 00:45:18,247
...are getting engaged.

523
00:45:18,248 --> 00:45:23,248
Let's all raise a toast.
It's time to dance.

524
00:45:42,248 --> 00:45:43,247
Record!

525
00:45:43,248 --> 00:45:44,497
- Good evening!

526
00:45:44,498 --> 00:45:46,747
- Good evening!

527
00:45:46,748 --> 00:45:50,372
Meet the editor of the journal,
Preetam.

528
00:45:50,373 --> 00:45:52,997
Mr. Gurbaksh Singh.

529
00:45:52,998 --> 00:45:54,956
People of Phillaur, how are you doing?

530
00:45:54,957 --> 00:45:56,956
- All is well, sir.

531
00:45:56,957 --> 00:46:01,957
Today we will play Gauhar
Jaan's new record for you.

532
00:46:11,123 --> 00:46:12,247
- Shashi!

533
00:46:12,248 --> 00:46:16,372
Good evening.
- Good evening.

534
00:46:16,373 --> 00:46:19,456
Why are you dressed so fine today?

535
00:46:19,457 --> 00:46:21,247
The gramophone people
have come from the city.

536
00:46:21,248 --> 00:46:23,081
Everybody is going there.
Shashi, won't you come too?

537
00:46:23,082 --> 00:46:26,497
- No.
- Huh?

538
00:46:26,498 --> 00:46:30,247
Don't you have anything better to do?

539
00:46:30,248 --> 00:46:32,706
Is it a religious gathering?

540
00:46:32,707 --> 00:46:35,747
Or is it a speech by
one of our freedom fighters?

541
00:46:35,748 --> 00:46:40,331
I don't understand what is
wrong with the youth of our village.

542
00:46:40,332 --> 00:46:43,956
They don't care about the country.

543
00:46:43,957 --> 00:46:45,581
And you?

544
00:46:45,582 --> 00:46:48,997
How is it that you are going there?

545
00:46:48,998 --> 00:46:51,122
Let me talk to your father.
- No, no, no!

546
00:46:51,123 --> 00:46:52,456
I'm going. I'm going home.

547
00:46:52,457 --> 00:46:54,331
I'm not going for the show.
I'm going home.

548
00:46:54,332 --> 00:46:57,247
- Mother will be so upset with me.
I'll get into trouble.

549
00:46:57,248 --> 00:46:59,622
Shashi...
- Yes, brother?

550
00:46:59,623 --> 00:47:02,247
Don't get involved in all this,
my dear.

551
00:47:02,248 --> 00:47:04,581
No, don't worry. I have no
interest in such frivolity.

552
00:47:04,582 --> 00:47:09,582
The whole village may go,
but I won't.

553
00:47:18,832 --> 00:47:20,997
Will this box play the song?

554
00:47:20,998 --> 00:47:25,998
Yes.

555
00:47:26,998 --> 00:47:31,997
How on earth did the singer get
inside that with all the musicians?

556
00:47:31,998 --> 00:47:36,998
In that small box.

557
00:47:38,707 --> 00:47:42,081
I think Amrit is back.

558
00:47:42,082 --> 00:47:47,082
- Is the doctor at home?

559
00:47:57,332 --> 00:48:00,331
Namaste.
- Namaste, doctor.

560
00:48:00,332 --> 00:48:02,122
I'm from the
neighbouring village.

561
00:48:02,123 --> 00:48:04,622
One of their friends got
into a scuffle with the British...

562
00:48:04,623 --> 00:48:07,497
and he got shot.

563
00:48:07,498 --> 00:48:10,997
Brother...

564
00:48:10,998 --> 00:48:12,747
I'm locking the door from outside.

565
00:48:12,748 --> 00:48:14,956
Go to sleep. And if anyone asks,
don't say anything.

566
00:48:14,957 --> 00:48:17,206
I haven't heard anything, so...

567
00:48:17,207 --> 00:48:18,997
Bless you.

568
00:48:18,998 --> 00:48:23,998
Let's go.

569
00:49:09,248 --> 00:49:10,622
Good evening.

570
00:49:10,623 --> 00:49:15,623
Shashi.

571
00:49:19,123 --> 00:49:22,872
Soma...

572
00:49:22,873 --> 00:49:24,622
Isn't she the doctor's sister?

573
00:49:24,623 --> 00:49:29,623
Who? Shashi?

574
00:49:30,707 --> 00:49:33,956
She's not your type.
She's very respectable.

575
00:49:33,957 --> 00:49:38,957
What makes you think
I'm not respectable?

576
00:49:41,207 --> 00:49:42,956
Let her be, brother.

577
00:49:42,957 --> 00:49:47,957
She doesn't even come
to listen to your songs.

578
00:50:29,498 --> 00:50:34,498
- Take this, my dear.
This week's journal.

579
00:50:35,623 --> 00:50:37,997
Thank you.
- Have a good day.

580
00:50:37,998 --> 00:50:40,331
Let's go.

581
00:50:40,332 --> 00:50:41,997
What happened?
- Isn't it there?

582
00:50:41,998 --> 00:50:46,581
Gurbaksh Singh, the editor has
written an open letter to Phillauri.

583
00:50:46,582 --> 00:50:48,497
Asking him to disclose his identity.

584
00:50:48,498 --> 00:50:49,706
This was bound to happen.

585
00:50:49,707 --> 00:50:52,747
Phillauri writes so beautifully.

586
00:50:52,748 --> 00:50:55,872
I think he should come forward.

587
00:50:55,873 --> 00:50:58,956
Tell me, if he writes so well,
why does he have to be secretive?

588
00:50:58,957 --> 00:51:00,372
He sings these songs
in front of everyone.

589
00:51:00,373 --> 00:51:02,372
- Hello, ladies.

590
00:51:02,373 --> 00:51:03,456
How are you, Miss Amrit?

591
00:51:03,457 --> 00:51:06,497
Very well.
- Let's go.

592
00:51:06,498 --> 00:51:10,622
Why Shashi, why don't
you come to listen to my songs?

593
00:51:10,623 --> 00:51:12,372
Girls don't go to such gatherings.

594
00:51:12,373 --> 00:51:17,373
Of course they do.
They come secretively.

595
00:51:17,498 --> 00:51:19,497
But you don't do that.

596
00:51:19,498 --> 00:51:22,497
Are you scared of your brother?

597
00:51:22,498 --> 00:51:25,956
Your songs are not
worth listening to.

598
00:51:25,957 --> 00:51:30,957
You don't like my songs, but you
read my poems in the journal.

599
00:51:32,123 --> 00:51:36,247
You can fool the world, but

600
00:51:36,248 --> 00:51:39,497
...how can you lie to yourself?

601
00:51:39,498 --> 00:51:43,622
You have been blessed
with such a good voice.

602
00:51:43,623 --> 00:51:46,956
Everybody comes to listen
to you sing.

603
00:51:46,957 --> 00:51:48,581
You are so fortunate.

604
00:51:48,582 --> 00:51:50,872
People will listen
to every word you say.

605
00:51:50,873 --> 00:51:54,372
Do you know, only a few people
get this kind of opportunity?

606
00:51:54,373 --> 00:51:56,997
You can change the way people think.

607
00:51:56,998 --> 00:51:59,372
But you?

608
00:51:59,373 --> 00:52:01,997
You sing meaningless songs.

609
00:52:01,998 --> 00:52:06,998
Your songs have no depth or poetry.

610
00:52:08,498 --> 00:52:13,498
No poetry?

611
00:52:15,207 --> 00:52:20,207
"An unfolding. Like an unfurling of wings.
Love flies in..."

612
00:52:27,373 --> 00:52:32,373
"Disruptive. Breaking the dawn,
With the edge of it's beak."

613
00:52:33,082 --> 00:52:38,082
"I have coaxed it to stay. Fattened
on sugar drops. From the tip of..."

614
00:52:40,957 --> 00:52:45,957
You should be ashamed of yourself.

615
00:53:14,998 --> 00:53:19,998
I'm sure nobody dances like this
even in brothels.

616
00:53:24,707 --> 00:53:26,247
If the elders drink like this...

617
00:53:26,248 --> 00:53:28,622
...what will the children learn!

618
00:53:28,623 --> 00:53:30,956
Why can't you leave me alone?

619
00:53:30,957 --> 00:53:33,622
Please.

620
00:53:33,623 --> 00:53:36,581
You know why...

621
00:53:36,582 --> 00:53:41,582
A married woman has to stay in her
husband's house as long as she lives.

622
00:53:41,623 --> 00:53:43,997
But aren't you dead already?

623
00:53:43,998 --> 00:53:48,247
I died a spinster and
got married after that.

624
00:53:48,248 --> 00:53:49,622
Why are you bringing
this up again?

625
00:53:49,623 --> 00:53:51,122
It's the truth.

626
00:53:51,123 --> 00:53:53,081
You have done this.

627
00:53:53,082 --> 00:53:54,706
You cut down the tree.

628
00:53:54,707 --> 00:53:56,497
And who gets married to a tree?

629
00:53:56,498 --> 00:53:58,747
What the...? Why don't you
leave me alone?

630
00:53:58,748 --> 00:54:02,456
- You want me to leave you alone?

631
00:54:02,457 --> 00:54:04,747
Great. She's been drinking too.

632
00:54:04,748 --> 00:54:08,956
No, look... I wasn't...
I wasn't talking to you.

633
00:54:08,957 --> 00:54:13,957
Who were you talking to then?
Who else is here?

634
00:54:15,248 --> 00:54:17,497
Wait...look...there is...there
is something I need to tell you.

635
00:54:17,498 --> 00:54:20,581
It's like this...
we have a big problem.

636
00:54:20,582 --> 00:54:21,372
Okay?

637
00:54:21,373 --> 00:54:24,747
I got married, by mistake...
- Mistake?

638
00:54:24,748 --> 00:54:26,956
Am I a mistake?
- No...no.

639
00:54:26,957 --> 00:54:28,372
I knew it.

640
00:54:28,373 --> 00:54:30,456
That's why you were behaving
so weirdly over there.

641
00:54:30,457 --> 00:54:32,831
Hey that's because...that's
because of Shashi.

642
00:54:32,832 --> 00:54:34,872
Who is Shashi?

643
00:54:34,873 --> 00:54:38,372
This freakin' girl I'm seeing!

644
00:54:38,373 --> 00:54:40,122
Finally you are telling
me the truth.

645
00:54:40,123 --> 00:54:43,122
You are having an affair
with somebody else. Isn't it?

646
00:54:43,123 --> 00:54:45,122
Not that kind of seeing someone,
I can actually see someone.

647
00:54:45,123 --> 00:54:48,372
I can see a girl.
That kind of "seeing".

648
00:54:48,373 --> 00:54:50,497
I can see a ghost.
I...l can see a ghost.

649
00:54:50,498 --> 00:54:54,872
Shut up!

650
00:54:54,873 --> 00:54:57,706
Enough...

651
00:54:57,707 --> 00:55:00,706
Enough of this nonsense, Kanan.

652
00:55:00,707 --> 00:55:04,872
You don't think of me at all,
do you?

653
00:55:04,873 --> 00:55:08,997
You kept saying,
I want to go to Canada!

654
00:55:08,998 --> 00:55:12,622
Who helped you then?

655
00:55:12,623 --> 00:55:15,206
I did.

656
00:55:15,207 --> 00:55:20,122
I convinced your
parents to let you go.

657
00:55:20,123 --> 00:55:23,372
I said, let him fulfill
his dreams.

658
00:55:23,373 --> 00:55:28,373
And you... you disappeared
for three years.

659
00:55:30,123 --> 00:55:34,372
When I asked you why,
you just sent me a message saying...

660
00:55:34,373 --> 00:55:38,997
..."but baby, I love you",
with a smiley.

661
00:55:38,998 --> 00:55:42,622
And I was okay with it.

662
00:55:42,623 --> 00:55:47,331
You said we should get
betrothed and get married later.

663
00:55:47,332 --> 00:55:50,581
I agreed to that too.

664
00:55:50,582 --> 00:55:54,081
Who gets betrothed over Skype, Kanan?

665
00:55:54,082 --> 00:55:57,747
On Skype!!!

666
00:55:57,748 --> 00:56:02,748
And today...when we are
finally getting engaged...

667
00:56:03,873 --> 00:56:06,872
...you are behaving
as if you don't want to.

668
00:56:06,873 --> 00:56:10,081
But Anu, I want to.
I want to get engaged to you.

669
00:56:10,082 --> 00:56:11,956
Please just...

670
00:56:11,957 --> 00:56:13,247
Thanks, man.

671
00:56:13,248 --> 00:56:14,997
You are doing me a big favour,
aren't you...

672
00:56:14,998 --> 00:56:16,081
...by agreeing to marry me?

673
00:56:16,082 --> 00:56:17,706
Did anyone ask me
before finalizing this?

674
00:56:17,707 --> 00:56:18,997
Are you being forced into this?

675
00:56:18,998 --> 00:56:23,998
Yes!

676
00:56:33,082 --> 00:56:38,082
Anu...

677
00:57:19,957 --> 00:57:22,622
- 'You can change the
way people think.'

678
00:57:22,623 --> 00:57:24,872
- 'But you...'

679
00:57:24,873 --> 00:57:29,873
- 'You sing meaningless songs.'

680
00:57:47,082 --> 00:57:50,331
Don't get married to me as a favour.

681
00:57:50,332 --> 00:57:54,122
I don't want to force you
into sharing your life with me.

682
00:57:54,123 --> 00:57:56,997
I love you, man.

683
00:57:56,998 --> 00:58:01,998
Don't insult me like this.

684
00:58:17,373 --> 00:58:21,247
- 'Your songs have no depth or poetry.'

685
00:58:21,248 --> 00:58:26,248
- 'You should be ashamed of yourself.'

686
00:58:52,457 --> 00:58:55,997
Are you upset because
of what Shashi said?

687
00:58:55,998 --> 00:59:00,998
I don't want to sing. That's all.

688
00:59:11,748 --> 00:59:13,372
- Don't worry.

689
00:59:13,373 --> 00:59:18,373
- I know what will help
you get into the mood.

690
00:59:20,332 --> 00:59:24,872
Please leave.

691
00:59:24,873 --> 00:59:28,206
I've heard that there's a
new girl at Banto's place.

692
00:59:28,207 --> 00:59:29,622
Want to go there tonight?

693
00:59:29,623 --> 00:59:33,956
- Huh?

694
00:59:33,957 --> 00:59:35,456
Don't you understand
what I'm saying?

695
00:59:35,457 --> 00:59:39,456
Just leave me alone!

696
00:59:39,457 --> 00:59:44,457
Okay, as you wish.

697
01:01:10,748 --> 01:01:15,622
"Spring is here."

698
01:01:15,623 --> 01:01:20,623
"The gentle breeze..."

699
01:01:45,123 --> 01:01:49,081
- Excuse me, just a second.

700
01:01:49,082 --> 01:01:50,247
Do you have that journal, Preetam?

701
01:01:50,248 --> 01:01:51,747
Of course.

702
01:01:51,748 --> 01:01:56,748
One minute.

703
01:01:58,498 --> 01:02:03,498
Here you go.

704
01:02:08,748 --> 01:02:12,247
But the poem is not here.

705
01:02:12,248 --> 01:02:14,581
Your poem?

706
01:02:14,582 --> 01:02:19,497
Don't you know, it hasn't
been published this week?

707
01:02:19,498 --> 01:02:21,247
And last week?

708
01:02:21,248 --> 01:02:22,331
You must have the old issues, right?

709
01:02:22,332 --> 01:02:27,332
Yes. Give me a minute.

710
01:02:31,332 --> 01:02:32,956
Are the poems there?

711
01:02:32,957 --> 01:02:37,331
See for yourself.

712
01:02:37,332 --> 01:02:42,332
Here.

713
01:03:57,498 --> 01:04:02,498
"What I thought were stars..."

714
01:04:05,873 --> 01:04:10,873
"...were tiny holes
in the fabric of the night."

715
01:04:14,623 --> 01:04:19,623
- "I managed to unstitch
and unravel..."

716
01:04:20,832 --> 01:04:25,122
- a corner of the dark skies."

717
01:04:25,123 --> 01:04:30,123
- "And realized it was your light..."

718
01:04:39,498 --> 01:04:44,372
"...on the other side."

719
01:04:44,373 --> 01:04:49,373
"Stealing through my night."

720
01:04:53,623 --> 01:04:58,623
"Stealing through my night."

721
01:05:29,123 --> 01:05:33,331
I didn't write that.

722
01:05:33,332 --> 01:05:38,332
I know.

723
01:05:39,998 --> 01:05:44,998
You still don't get it,
do you, Phillauri?

724
01:05:45,707 --> 01:05:49,747
I'm the other Phillauri
of this Phillaur village.

725
01:05:49,748 --> 01:05:54,748
I wrote these poems.

726
01:06:25,957 --> 01:06:28,622
"My prayer of your name,
flies in the sky.."

727
01:06:28,623 --> 01:06:32,372
"..with hundred of wings."

728
01:06:32,373 --> 01:06:35,081
"My prayer of your name,
flies in the sky.."

729
01:06:35,082 --> 01:06:40,082
"..with hundred of wings."

730
01:06:51,498 --> 01:06:54,247
"My prayer of your name,
flies in the sky.."

731
01:06:54,248 --> 01:06:57,872
"..with hundred of wings."

732
01:06:57,873 --> 01:07:00,747
"My prayer of your name,
flies in the sky.."

733
01:07:00,748 --> 01:07:03,956
"..with hundred of wings."

734
01:07:03,957 --> 01:07:08,957
"My heart has become monk."

735
01:07:16,582 --> 01:07:19,872
"My heart has become monk."

736
01:07:19,873 --> 01:07:23,497
"it began to move to your place."

737
01:07:23,498 --> 01:07:26,247
"My prayer of your name,
flies in the sky.."

738
01:07:26,248 --> 01:07:31,248
"..with hundred of wings."

739
01:07:39,498 --> 01:07:44,498
"My prayer of your name."

740
01:08:08,248 --> 01:08:13,248
"Your eyes are like a book,
if you open, I will read them."

741
01:08:14,582 --> 01:08:19,582
"With kajal stories of your is written,
beloved."

742
01:08:21,123 --> 01:08:26,123
"I will keep talks on your lips,
like Batasha."

743
01:08:27,457 --> 01:08:32,457
"it will get melted slowly,
tell me if I should taste it."

744
01:08:33,748 --> 01:08:36,581
"My prayer of your name,
flies in the sky.."

745
01:08:36,582 --> 01:08:39,997
"..with hundred of wings."

746
01:08:39,998 --> 01:08:42,997
"My prayer of your name,
flies in the sky.."

747
01:08:42,998 --> 01:08:46,372
"..with hundred of wings."

748
01:08:46,373 --> 01:08:51,373
"My heart has become monk."

749
01:08:58,998 --> 01:09:02,122
"My heart has become monk."

750
01:09:02,123 --> 01:09:05,872
"it began to move to your place."

751
01:09:05,873 --> 01:09:08,622
"My prayer of your name,
flies in the sky.."

752
01:09:08,623 --> 01:09:12,372
"..with hundred of wings."

753
01:09:12,373 --> 01:09:15,081
"My prayer of your name,
flies in the sky.."

754
01:09:15,082 --> 01:09:18,247
"..with hundred of wings."

755
01:09:18,248 --> 01:09:23,248
"O my beloved, Your talks, I've collected
them as if they're my treasure."

756
01:09:24,498 --> 01:09:29,498
"Of desires,
I've filled bowlfuls."

757
01:09:34,248 --> 01:09:39,248
"I've coloured the Sky in your colour."

758
01:09:50,707 --> 01:09:55,707
"My prayer of your name,
flies in the sky.."

759
01:09:56,498 --> 01:10:01,498
"..with hundred of wings."

760
01:10:03,498 --> 01:10:08,498
"My prayer of your name,
flies in the sky.."

761
01:10:09,498 --> 01:10:14,498
"it began to move to your place."

762
01:10:20,998 --> 01:10:23,331
- "He told me a tale..."

763
01:10:23,332 --> 01:10:27,456
- "...of a prince."

764
01:10:27,457 --> 01:10:30,997
- "Who gallops on drum beats."

765
01:10:30,998 --> 01:10:35,831
"A war cry of heartbeats."

766
01:10:35,832 --> 01:10:40,832
"Watch his Cupid bow."

767
01:10:44,873 --> 01:10:49,873
"He will disarm you, little princess."

768
01:10:54,332 --> 01:10:58,747
"My prayer of your name."

769
01:10:58,748 --> 01:11:03,622
"My prayer of your name."

770
01:11:03,623 --> 01:11:08,497
"My prayer of your name."

771
01:11:08,498 --> 01:11:13,247
"My prayer of your name."

772
01:11:13,248 --> 01:11:18,248
"My prayer of your name."

773
01:11:18,623 --> 01:11:22,997
"My prayer of your name,
flies in the sky.."

774
01:11:22,998 --> 01:11:27,998
"..with hundred of wings."

775
01:11:28,248 --> 01:11:32,622
"My prayer of your name."

776
01:11:32,623 --> 01:11:37,497
"My prayer of your name."

777
01:11:37,498 --> 01:11:42,497
"My prayer of your name."

778
01:11:42,498 --> 01:11:47,372
"My prayer of your name."

779
01:11:47,373 --> 01:11:52,373
"My prayer of your name."

780
01:12:10,623 --> 01:12:15,247
Do you remember editor Gurbaksh
Singh's open letter in the newspaper...

781
01:12:15,248 --> 01:12:17,622
...asking Phillauri
to disclose his identity?

782
01:12:17,623 --> 01:12:18,872
Yes.

783
01:12:18,873 --> 01:12:21,706
I sent a reply to him.

784
01:12:21,707 --> 01:12:22,997
Really?

785
01:12:22,998 --> 01:12:24,122
What did you write?

786
01:12:24,123 --> 01:12:26,997
That you are the real Phillauri.

787
01:12:26,998 --> 01:12:28,831
What?

788
01:12:28,832 --> 01:12:33,122
He's coming to Amritsar with the
people from the gramophone company.

789
01:12:33,123 --> 01:12:36,122
They will release a
record of Phillauri's songs.

790
01:12:36,123 --> 01:12:38,872
My words, your voice...

791
01:12:38,873 --> 01:12:39,872
your face.

792
01:12:39,873 --> 01:12:41,372
Are you crazy?

793
01:12:41,373 --> 01:12:42,997
Why?

794
01:12:42,998 --> 01:12:45,081
The record will bear Phillauri's name.

795
01:12:45,082 --> 01:12:47,956
And we're both Phillauris, aren't we?

796
01:12:47,957 --> 01:12:49,206
Try and understand.

797
01:12:49,207 --> 01:12:52,247
I'm not even allowed to
go up to Ludhiana.

798
01:12:52,248 --> 01:12:55,372
It took me a lot of courage to write...

799
01:12:55,373 --> 01:12:58,831
...and get these poems published.

800
01:12:58,832 --> 01:13:03,832
Girls from respectable families
cannot get involved in such things.

801
01:13:06,707 --> 01:13:08,872
You will go, won't you?

802
01:13:08,873 --> 01:13:11,872
You are a poet, so intelligent.

803
01:13:11,873 --> 01:13:16,873
I can't believe that you
would say such silly things.

804
01:13:18,373 --> 01:13:20,081
Must be Soma.
- At this hour?

805
01:13:20,082 --> 01:13:22,497
He comes over at odd hours.

806
01:13:22,498 --> 01:13:25,247
Wait, I'll be there!

807
01:13:25,248 --> 01:13:30,248
I'm coming! I'm coming!

808
01:14:03,498 --> 01:14:08,498
Kishanchand! You'll kill her!

809
01:14:08,707 --> 01:14:13,707
Let's go!

810
01:15:38,248 --> 01:15:43,248
Here, drink this.

811
01:15:44,707 --> 01:15:49,707
It's medicinal.

812
01:15:58,873 --> 01:16:03,873
Sister...

813
01:16:04,082 --> 01:16:09,082
I've raised you like my daughter.

814
01:16:10,998 --> 01:16:15,122
I educated you so...

815
01:16:15,123 --> 01:16:19,747
...that you could read the Holy Book.

816
01:16:19,748 --> 01:16:24,748
So that you know right from wrong.

817
01:16:26,998 --> 01:16:30,331
I didn't get married so that...

818
01:16:30,332 --> 01:16:35,332
...I could give you all my love.

819
01:16:42,498 --> 01:16:47,247
What did I do wrong?

820
01:16:47,248 --> 01:16:52,248
That you punished me like this.

821
01:16:58,998 --> 01:17:03,331
He's not worthy of you.

822
01:17:03,332 --> 01:17:06,247
- He's worth nothing.

823
01:17:06,248 --> 01:17:11,248
- Girls like you don't get
involved with men like him.

824
01:17:12,457 --> 01:17:17,457
Respectable people like us,
don't get involved with...

825
01:17:17,998 --> 01:17:22,998
...disreputable music and singers.

826
01:17:31,498 --> 01:17:36,498
Drink this.

827
01:18:12,623 --> 01:18:17,623
- Enough, my dear. Stop crying.

828
01:18:21,748 --> 01:18:26,748
Anu.

829
01:18:26,873 --> 01:18:28,497
Just two days to go for the wedding.

830
01:18:28,498 --> 01:18:31,497
What has possessed you now?

831
01:18:31,498 --> 01:18:33,497
- Please don't scold him, Dolly.

832
01:18:33,498 --> 01:18:36,206
- He will tell us,
if we ask him nicely.

833
01:18:36,207 --> 01:18:41,207
Aren't we doing all this
for their happiness?

834
01:18:41,248 --> 01:18:42,997
He's anything but happy.

835
01:18:42,998 --> 01:18:46,872
Anu, please let him speak.

836
01:18:46,873 --> 01:18:50,372
Kanan, don't be scared.

837
01:18:50,373 --> 01:18:51,872
- Tell us what the problem is.

838
01:18:51,873 --> 01:18:52,872
- Let me tell you.

839
01:18:52,873 --> 01:18:54,747
He actually got married to me.

840
01:18:54,748 --> 01:18:56,206
And then you got
the tree cut down.

841
01:18:56,207 --> 01:18:57,206
What do we do now?
- It's...it's...

842
01:18:57,207 --> 01:18:58,872
It's just too early.

843
01:18:58,873 --> 01:19:00,747
What? What is too early?

844
01:19:00,748 --> 01:19:02,997
I just finished my studies.

845
01:19:02,998 --> 01:19:04,372
Getting married at this age?

846
01:19:04,373 --> 01:19:06,122
So when do you want
to get married?

847
01:19:06,123 --> 01:19:09,997
What is it that you want to do
that can't be done after marriage?

848
01:19:09,998 --> 01:19:14,872
I... I just...l just need to find myself.

849
01:19:14,873 --> 01:19:17,247
- Well done!

850
01:19:17,248 --> 01:19:20,206
He's got his first world
issues to Amritsar.

851
01:19:20,207 --> 01:19:23,372
Where exactly are you
searching for yourself?

852
01:19:23,373 --> 01:19:25,247
What does he mean?
You are right here.

853
01:19:25,248 --> 01:19:28,122
Should I help?

854
01:19:28,123 --> 01:19:33,122
See...this is you.

855
01:19:33,123 --> 01:19:38,123
And here is Anu.

856
01:19:42,498 --> 01:19:44,497
- I've spent all my life here.

857
01:19:44,498 --> 01:19:46,372
I didn't need to go
anywhere to find myself.

858
01:19:46,373 --> 01:19:48,331
He doesn't know what he is saying.

859
01:19:48,332 --> 01:19:49,747
You guys just don't get it!

860
01:19:49,748 --> 01:19:51,122
So explain!

861
01:19:51,123 --> 01:19:53,706
My dear, after marriage,
you can search...

862
01:19:53,707 --> 01:19:55,206
You're not getting it!

863
01:19:55,207 --> 01:19:56,331
He is right.

864
01:19:56,332 --> 01:19:57,831
We don't understand anything.

865
01:19:57,832 --> 01:20:01,206
- You both have been joined
at the hip since you were kids.

866
01:20:01,207 --> 01:20:02,831
Both of you love each other.

867
01:20:02,832 --> 01:20:04,456
I love him, but he doesn't.

868
01:20:04,457 --> 01:20:06,122
Don't you love her?

869
01:20:06,123 --> 01:20:07,372
Told you so many times, I do!

870
01:20:07,373 --> 01:20:08,747
But you don't want to get married.

871
01:20:08,748 --> 01:20:11,497
I want to, I want to marry you.

872
01:20:11,498 --> 01:20:14,372
Well, then the problem is solved.

873
01:20:14,373 --> 01:20:17,331
Come on, hug each other.

874
01:20:17,332 --> 01:20:20,747
- Great, things are back on track now.

875
01:20:20,748 --> 01:20:22,247
- Enough of this!

876
01:20:22,248 --> 01:20:24,997
- Let's go.

877
01:20:24,998 --> 01:20:26,497
- Well, problem sorted!

878
01:20:26,498 --> 01:20:28,206
Let's go.
- Make yourself a drink.

879
01:20:28,207 --> 01:20:29,206
- Come on, let's go.

880
01:20:29,207 --> 01:20:30,497
- Let's go, mother.
Let's get a glass.

881
01:20:30,498 --> 01:20:33,497
- Let's go.

882
01:20:33,498 --> 01:20:37,497
- Today I want to drink.

883
01:20:37,498 --> 01:20:40,247
I gave you a chance to call it off.

884
01:20:40,248 --> 01:20:45,081
What more do you want? Tell me.

885
01:20:45,082 --> 01:20:50,082
But you are too scared to, aren't you?

886
01:21:13,123 --> 01:21:15,122
- Philanderer...

887
01:21:15,123 --> 01:21:17,247
- Womaniser...

888
01:21:17,248 --> 01:21:19,622
Alcoholic...

889
01:21:19,623 --> 01:21:24,623
It's all true.

890
01:21:24,873 --> 01:21:29,873
I'm all this and more.

891
01:21:33,498 --> 01:21:36,872
I was all this and more.

892
01:21:36,873 --> 01:21:41,873
Before I met Shashi.

893
01:21:43,498 --> 01:21:47,872
How dare you enter my house!

894
01:21:47,873 --> 01:21:49,247
I will kill you!

895
01:21:49,248 --> 01:21:53,747
Don't you dare look at my sister!

896
01:21:53,748 --> 01:21:56,122
You are right.

897
01:21:56,123 --> 01:21:59,372
I am not worthy of her.

898
01:21:59,373 --> 01:22:02,081
But I can try.

899
01:22:02,082 --> 01:22:05,122
And I will be.

900
01:22:05,123 --> 01:22:10,123
I am going to Amritsar.

901
01:22:10,207 --> 01:22:14,872
To record the songs written by Shashi.

902
01:22:14,873 --> 01:22:17,872
You don't know, do you?

903
01:22:17,873 --> 01:22:22,122
She is a poet.

904
01:22:22,123 --> 01:22:26,122
Nobody knows this.

905
01:22:26,123 --> 01:22:29,372
- Everybody in Punjab reads her poems.

906
01:22:29,373 --> 01:22:33,206
But they don't know
that she is the poet.

907
01:22:33,207 --> 01:22:38,207
I will make sure she gets her due.

908
01:22:38,373 --> 01:22:41,247
On Baisakhi day...

909
01:22:41,248 --> 01:22:46,122
I'll ask you for
her hand in marriage.

910
01:22:46,123 --> 01:22:50,497
Please take care
of Shashi till I return.

911
01:22:50,498 --> 01:22:53,747
After that, I'll take
better care of her...

912
01:22:53,748 --> 01:22:58,748
...than you ever could.

913
01:23:21,498 --> 01:23:26,498
"My heart has got tangled with yours,
that every thread in it was pulled back."

914
01:23:45,332 --> 01:23:50,332
"My heart has got tangled with yours,
that every thread in it was pulled back."

915
01:23:51,332 --> 01:23:56,332
"Like in a saint's tomb,
shawl has been draped."

916
01:23:56,623 --> 01:24:01,623
"Everyday it wove as it flew."

917
01:24:02,582 --> 01:24:07,582
"Writing a ballad of love,
have I again."

918
01:24:11,582 --> 01:24:16,582
"Sahiba (Juliet),
go where Mirza (Romeo) goes."

919
01:24:23,373 --> 01:24:28,373
"Sahiba (Juliet),
go where Mirza (Romeo) goes."

920
01:24:36,707 --> 01:24:39,456
- Every girl dreams of this day.

921
01:24:39,457 --> 01:24:43,747
I'm sure Anu has too.

922
01:24:43,748 --> 01:24:45,956
Don't ruin it for her.

923
01:24:45,957 --> 01:24:48,497
I'm trying to do what
everybody wants me to.

924
01:24:48,498 --> 01:24:51,456
I'm trying to make everybody happy.

925
01:24:51,457 --> 01:24:56,457
If you aren't happy,
how can you make others happy?

926
01:24:57,748 --> 01:25:02,748
You are a man, so act like one.

927
01:25:03,123 --> 01:25:07,831
I am about to spend the
rest of my life with her.

928
01:25:07,832 --> 01:25:09,206
Of course, I'm scared.

929
01:25:09,207 --> 01:25:14,207
Are you scared of making a decision?

930
01:25:14,748 --> 01:25:18,372
If you don't, you'll only regret it.

931
01:25:18,373 --> 01:25:20,581
If you go ahead and get married...

932
01:25:20,582 --> 01:25:25,582
...in spite of her being there,
you'll be lonely, always.

933
01:25:27,373 --> 01:25:29,872
"There were blank letters.."

934
01:25:29,873 --> 01:25:34,873
"..l cried and sent you
with the seals of love."

935
01:25:39,248 --> 01:25:44,248
"There was a paperboat of my heart.."

936
01:25:45,748 --> 01:25:50,748
"..the canal of tears made it drown."

937
01:26:03,082 --> 01:26:08,082
"This out of tone music of the heart,
it makes some case, listen to it."

938
01:26:09,082 --> 01:26:11,872
"You are my mirror,
and you don't recognize me."

939
01:26:11,873 --> 01:26:16,873
"You don't consider me what I am,
no, don't be a stranger now."

940
01:26:19,498 --> 01:26:24,498
"There is a cry of pain in the heart,
like some musical notes."

941
01:26:25,248 --> 01:26:28,497
"You are there in my heart,
like some noiseless (peaceful) ragas.."

942
01:26:28,498 --> 01:26:32,081
"..like some threads of saffron,
you were dissolved in such a way."

943
01:26:32,082 --> 01:26:34,456
"I was lost..."

944
01:26:34,457 --> 01:26:39,457
"What a hazy grey color
is there on my heart..."

945
01:26:50,832 --> 01:26:55,832
"My heart has got tangled with yours,
that every thread in it was pulled back."

946
01:26:56,873 --> 01:27:01,873
"Like in a saint's tomb,
shawl has been draped."

947
01:27:02,748 --> 01:27:07,748
"Everyday it wove as it flew."

948
01:27:08,082 --> 01:27:13,082
"Writing a ballad of love,
have I again."

949
01:27:16,998 --> 01:27:21,998
"Sahiba (Juliet),
go where Mirza (Romeo) goes."

950
01:28:03,748 --> 01:28:08,748
"Sahiba (Juliet).."

951
01:28:09,957 --> 01:28:14,957
"O Sahiba,
there is injury of separation."

952
01:28:15,873 --> 01:28:20,873
"O Sahiba,
the heart has become a rebel."

953
01:28:21,957 --> 01:28:26,956
"The obstinacy has gone beyond the limit,
and the tongue chants."

954
01:28:26,957 --> 01:28:29,872
"Without you.."

955
01:28:29,873 --> 01:28:34,873
"Without you, even my breathe pierces me
like glass."

956
01:28:35,873 --> 01:28:40,873
"Without you,
and the life seems like ash."

957
01:28:41,873 --> 01:28:46,873
"Without you, even my breathe pierces me
like glass."

958
01:28:47,748 --> 01:28:52,748
"Without you,
and the life seems like ash."

959
01:29:21,623 --> 01:29:24,122
Go and see who is there.

960
01:29:24,123 --> 01:29:27,206
Namaste.
- Namaste.

961
01:29:27,207 --> 01:29:31,081
There's a letter for the doctor
and some money too.

962
01:29:31,082 --> 01:29:36,082
Namaste.
- Namaste.

963
01:29:36,873 --> 01:29:39,247
300 rupees.

964
01:29:39,248 --> 01:29:42,206
Who has sent it?

965
01:29:42,207 --> 01:29:47,207
Roop Lal Phillauri.

966
01:29:48,248 --> 01:29:52,622
- That's a lot of money, doctor.
My tip?

967
01:29:52,623 --> 01:29:57,623
Baisakhi is around the corner.

968
01:30:31,123 --> 01:30:36,123
I was wrong.

969
01:30:42,998 --> 01:30:47,998
You had asked him to do this,
hadn't you?

970
01:30:50,582 --> 01:30:55,081
You would've remained
in the shadows...

971
01:30:55,082 --> 01:31:00,082
...and he could've become famous
and made a lot of money.

972
01:31:05,248 --> 01:31:09,747
But he didn't do that.

973
01:31:09,748 --> 01:31:13,997
He is worthy of you.

974
01:31:13,998 --> 01:31:18,998
He values and respects you.

975
01:31:29,123 --> 01:31:34,123
How can I refuse to let my
sister marry such a man?

976
01:31:36,998 --> 01:31:39,872
He will be here on Baisakhi day.

977
01:31:39,873 --> 01:31:41,706
Your groom.

978
01:31:41,707 --> 01:31:46,707
This brother of yours will
give you away in style.

979
01:31:48,248 --> 01:31:52,956
Oh brother...

980
01:31:52,957 --> 01:31:57,957
My child.

981
01:32:28,248 --> 01:32:32,247
Anu...

982
01:32:32,248 --> 01:32:35,997
- Anu...?

983
01:32:35,998 --> 01:32:40,998
Anu...

984
01:32:47,998 --> 01:32:52,998
- Anu...?

985
01:33:26,082 --> 01:33:28,497
<i>Anu'!</i>

986
01:33:28,498 --> 01:33:30,831
<i>Anu'!</i>

987
01:33:30,832 --> 01:33:33,622
Why does everybody
keep fainting in this house?

988
01:33:33,623 --> 01:33:36,456
What did you do?

989
01:33:36,457 --> 01:33:37,331
I was only trying to help.

990
01:33:37,332 --> 01:33:39,206
I can see that.

991
01:33:39,207 --> 01:33:41,456
Anu...

992
01:33:41,457 --> 01:33:43,997
Anu...

993
01:33:43,998 --> 01:33:45,622
Anu...

994
01:33:45,623 --> 01:33:50,623
Anu...? Baby?

995
01:33:57,123 --> 01:34:00,831
It's okay, it's alright,
chill. Relax...

996
01:34:00,832 --> 01:34:02,706
It's okay. chill, chill...

997
01:34:02,707 --> 01:34:04,122
Hey, it's okay.

998
01:34:04,123 --> 01:34:06,497
Anu, calm down. Calm down.

999
01:34:06,498 --> 01:34:07,997
She's harmless.

1000
01:34:07,998 --> 01:34:08,997
It's alright. It's alright.

1001
01:34:08,998 --> 01:34:10,997
Anu...Anu, it's alright.

1002
01:34:10,998 --> 01:34:13,997
Wh...wha...

1003
01:34:13,998 --> 01:34:15,872
You are lucky you
can only see the veil.

1004
01:34:15,873 --> 01:34:20,122
Think of how scared I have been.
I can see the whole ghost.

1005
01:34:20,123 --> 01:34:21,497
Why can't I see her?

1006
01:34:21,498 --> 01:34:25,081
Well, I'm married to her, so...

1007
01:34:25,082 --> 01:34:25,872
only I can see her.

1008
01:34:25,873 --> 01:34:28,747
You didn't want to marry me,
but you went and married a ghost?

1009
01:34:28,748 --> 01:34:31,831
I didn't do it purposely.
It just happened.

1010
01:34:31,832 --> 01:34:34,997
If we hadn't gone to the tree,
we wouldn't have gotten into this mess.

1011
01:34:34,998 --> 01:34:39,998
Marrying you would
get anyone into a mess.

1012
01:34:42,748 --> 01:34:46,456
Baby, don't say that.

1013
01:34:46,457 --> 01:34:51,122
I'm sorry, I was confused.

1014
01:34:51,123 --> 01:34:53,872
I'll fix everything.

1015
01:34:53,873 --> 01:34:58,873
Does this ghost have a name?

1016
01:35:01,832 --> 01:35:06,832
Shashi.

1017
01:35:08,748 --> 01:35:13,706
Shashi?

1018
01:35:13,707 --> 01:35:15,872
Come on, relax. She won't hurt you.

1019
01:35:15,873 --> 01:35:18,247
Calm down. Come on.

1020
01:35:18,248 --> 01:35:21,081
Nothing will happen.

1021
01:35:21,082 --> 01:35:26,082
Nothing will happen.

1022
01:35:34,623 --> 01:35:39,622
She dresses a little scantily,
but the girl is nice.

1023
01:35:39,623 --> 01:35:41,206
She likes you.

1024
01:35:41,207 --> 01:35:46,207
She likes you.

1025
01:35:47,123 --> 01:35:49,247
Thank you.

1026
01:35:49,248 --> 01:35:54,248
There...

1027
01:36:00,748 --> 01:36:03,206
Why are you here?

1028
01:36:03,207 --> 01:36:06,372
Didn't I tell you, the tree...

1029
01:36:06,373 --> 01:36:10,372
I don't know why
I am stuck here.

1030
01:36:10,373 --> 01:36:14,997
She doesn't know.

1031
01:36:14,998 --> 01:36:19,747
Did you have any
unfinished business?

1032
01:36:19,748 --> 01:36:24,748
Something you needed to do?

1033
01:36:29,207 --> 01:36:34,207
Maybe.

1034
01:36:39,623 --> 01:36:44,623
Congratulations, Kishanchand!

1035
01:36:51,373 --> 01:36:55,122
"The auspicious day has come."

1036
01:36:55,123 --> 01:37:00,123
"Come my friends the house
has been decorated."

1037
01:37:02,998 --> 01:37:07,998
"I have met my love
and congratulate me on my love."

1038
01:37:11,623 --> 01:37:16,623
"My lover will come and take me,
the house has been decorated."

1039
01:37:22,123 --> 01:37:26,247
What had I stolen from you
that you stole Phillauri from me?

1040
01:37:26,248 --> 01:37:29,247
You used to sing his praises
all the time...l fell in love.

1041
01:37:29,248 --> 01:37:34,122
Fell in love? You broke my heart.

1042
01:37:34,123 --> 01:37:36,997
Listen, what's the time?

1043
01:37:36,998 --> 01:37:38,872
This is the twentieth
time you are asking me.

1044
01:37:38,873 --> 01:37:42,622
It's 11 o'clock.

1045
01:37:42,623 --> 01:37:45,581
What's wrong? Can't wait,
you shameless hussy?

1046
01:37:45,582 --> 01:37:49,206
Can't wait, huh?

1047
01:37:49,207 --> 01:37:50,622
Granny's here.

1048
01:37:50,623 --> 01:37:54,081
Namaste.
- Namaste.

1049
01:37:54,082 --> 01:37:59,082
Congratulations.
May God bless you.

1050
01:38:00,082 --> 01:38:05,082
Namaste.

1051
01:38:07,373 --> 01:38:12,373
Put the flowers up properly!

1052
01:38:15,998 --> 01:38:19,206
What's wrong, Shashi?

1053
01:38:19,207 --> 01:38:20,872
See you fell sick.

1054
01:38:20,873 --> 01:38:22,581
You've been restless all morning.

1055
01:38:22,582 --> 01:38:27,247
Wait, I'll call your brother.

1056
01:38:27,248 --> 01:38:32,248
What happened?

1057
01:38:34,873 --> 01:38:39,873
Yuck! Disgusting!
- Shut up!

1058
01:38:39,957 --> 01:38:44,957
Did you do it with him?

1059
01:38:46,832 --> 01:38:51,832
Didn't you feel shy?

1060
01:38:58,207 --> 01:39:00,497
What! I'm going to be an aunt!

1061
01:39:00,498 --> 01:39:05,498
Shashi!

1062
01:39:33,373 --> 01:39:37,247
"The auspicious day has come."

1063
01:39:37,248 --> 01:39:42,248
"Come my friends the house
has been decorated."

1064
01:40:00,582 --> 01:40:04,622
God bless you.

1065
01:40:04,623 --> 01:40:08,247
Phillauri hasn't arrived as yet.

1066
01:40:08,248 --> 01:40:12,872
Don't worry.
He must have missed the train.

1067
01:40:12,873 --> 01:40:15,456
The next train will
be here in the evening.

1068
01:40:15,457 --> 01:40:18,372
I'm sure he'll be on it.

1069
01:40:18,373 --> 01:40:20,872
I will be thereto receive him.

1070
01:40:20,873 --> 01:40:25,873
Alright?

1071
01:40:29,998 --> 01:40:34,998
You are looking beautiful.

1072
01:40:58,957 --> 01:41:01,497
Amrit!

1073
01:41:01,498 --> 01:41:06,498
- Amrit!

1074
01:41:14,332 --> 01:41:16,331
Yes, brother?

1075
01:41:16,332 --> 01:41:18,872
I'm going to the railway
station to pick him up.

1076
01:41:18,873 --> 01:41:23,873
You take care of everything here.

1077
01:43:37,873 --> 01:43:42,873
Come on, let's go.
- Let's go.

1078
01:44:41,207 --> 01:44:46,207
There is a doctor in Lahore,
from a good family.

1079
01:44:50,707 --> 01:44:55,707
I'll send him a telegram tomorrow.

1080
01:44:56,248 --> 01:45:00,997
Lahore is very far from here.

1081
01:45:00,998 --> 01:45:05,998
Nobody will know about your past.

1082
01:45:10,248 --> 01:45:15,248
That you were disgracefully
left at the altar.

1083
01:47:16,082 --> 01:47:17,831
Are you mad?

1084
01:47:17,832 --> 01:47:22,206
Nobody is worth dying for.

1085
01:47:22,207 --> 01:47:25,747
- He took advantage of you.

1086
01:47:25,748 --> 01:47:29,622
He used your poetry.

1087
01:47:29,623 --> 01:47:32,747
This is how he paid you back.

1088
01:47:32,748 --> 01:47:37,372
But he had sent some money.

1089
01:47:37,373 --> 01:47:41,247
He sent her money.

1090
01:47:41,248 --> 01:47:44,872
He had gone to Amritsar, right?

1091
01:47:44,873 --> 01:47:45,872
When?

1092
01:47:45,873 --> 01:47:47,497
In April.

1093
01:47:47,498 --> 01:47:52,498
This year? Or the last...

1094
01:47:53,248 --> 01:47:55,456
I don't know.

1095
01:47:55,457 --> 01:47:57,956
I can't really tell how
much time has passed.

1096
01:47:57,957 --> 01:47:59,664
Which year is this?

1097
01:47:59,665 --> 01:48:03,872
2017.

1098
01:48:03,873 --> 01:48:07,956
98 years...

1099
01:48:07,957 --> 01:48:09,539
98 years, man...

1100
01:48:09,540 --> 01:48:13,622
98 years!

1101
01:48:13,623 --> 01:48:18,623
98?

1102
01:48:23,832 --> 01:48:27,081
Then why?

1103
01:48:27,082 --> 01:48:30,372
Why am I here?

1104
01:48:30,373 --> 01:48:32,289
Hey, Mr. Groom?

1105
01:48:32,290 --> 01:48:35,914
You...you're in the bedroom already?

1106
01:48:35,915 --> 01:48:40,915
You can't wait, right?

1107
01:48:42,123 --> 01:48:45,122
Anu's grandfather was just like you.

1108
01:48:45,123 --> 01:48:47,872
See...

1109
01:48:47,873 --> 01:48:50,039
He had given this to me...

1110
01:48:50,040 --> 01:48:52,372
on our wedding day.

1111
01:48:52,373 --> 01:48:57,373
Here.

1112
01:48:59,248 --> 01:49:02,664
This might break,
you might lose it...

1113
01:49:02,665 --> 01:49:07,665
but his love will be there...
forever.

1114
01:49:07,832 --> 01:49:11,497
Just like Kanan's love for you.

1115
01:49:11,498 --> 01:49:16,498
Isn't it, my dear?

1116
01:49:16,790 --> 01:49:19,122
You look so beautiful.

1117
01:49:19,123 --> 01:49:22,039
Just like an angel.

1118
01:49:22,040 --> 01:49:24,164
Kanan...

1119
01:49:24,165 --> 01:49:29,165
Don't you have something
to say to your bride?

1120
01:49:38,832 --> 01:49:42,831
"I was living in a half-remembered dream."

1121
01:49:42,832 --> 01:49:47,081
"And you brought me to my senses."

1122
01:49:47,082 --> 01:49:52,082
Idiot, say it to her.

1123
01:49:54,457 --> 01:49:59,457
"I was living in a half-remembered dream."

1124
01:49:59,873 --> 01:50:04,289
"And you brought me to my senses."

1125
01:50:04,290 --> 01:50:06,414
"You are my truth."

1126
01:50:06,415 --> 01:50:08,456
"And I bow down to you."

1127
01:50:08,457 --> 01:50:10,831
"You are my truth."

1128
01:50:10,832 --> 01:50:15,832
"And I bow down to you."

1129
01:50:17,123 --> 01:50:20,081
"Don't abandon me, dear heart."

1130
01:50:20,082 --> 01:50:22,289
"I am nothing without you."

1131
01:50:22,290 --> 01:50:25,622
"Don't abandon me, dear heart."

1132
01:50:25,623 --> 01:50:30,623
"I am nothing without you."

1133
01:50:30,707 --> 01:50:33,706
"Dear heart..."

1134
01:50:33,707 --> 01:50:37,081
"This pain of separation
wounds me.â€œ

1135
01:50:37,082 --> 01:50:39,747
"Dear heart..."

1136
01:50:39,748 --> 01:50:44,748
"This pain of separation
wounds me.â€œ

1137
01:51:02,540 --> 01:51:06,497
"it urges me to rebel."

1138
01:51:06,498 --> 01:51:10,164
"Dear heart..."

1139
01:51:10,165 --> 01:51:15,165
- "This pain of separation
wounds me..."

1140
01:51:16,498 --> 01:51:21,498
How does she know this poem?

1141
01:51:21,957 --> 01:51:26,122
Grandma, what song
are you singing?

1142
01:51:26,123 --> 01:51:28,539
It's from my favorite record, my dear.

1143
01:51:28,540 --> 01:51:31,789
"Dear heart..."

1144
01:51:31,790 --> 01:51:34,914
Can you show it to me, please?

1145
01:51:34,915 --> 01:51:39,164
Where is it?

1146
01:51:39,165 --> 01:51:44,165
Ah...here.

1147
01:51:44,748 --> 01:51:49,748
Here it is.

1148
01:52:05,498 --> 01:52:07,581
The record will have both our names.

1149
01:52:07,582 --> 01:52:09,706
The one who sang...

1150
01:52:09,707 --> 01:52:12,456
...and the one who wrote.

1151
01:52:12,457 --> 01:52:17,457
Both the Phillauris.

1152
01:52:23,957 --> 01:52:25,997
1919?

1153
01:52:25,998 --> 01:52:30,998
So long ago?

1154
01:52:32,290 --> 01:52:34,372
What a terrible year.

1155
01:52:34,373 --> 01:52:37,664
- With that inauspicious
Baisakhi day.

1156
01:52:37,665 --> 01:52:40,914
But today, we will not
talk about all that.

1157
01:52:40,915 --> 01:52:44,247
Today, we will have
a happy Baisakhi.

1158
01:52:44,248 --> 01:52:47,997
It was Baisakhi.

1159
01:52:47,998 --> 01:52:52,998
The day he was supposed
to return from Amritsar.

1160
01:52:59,623 --> 01:53:04,623
Amritsar...

1161
01:53:04,832 --> 01:53:09,832
Baisakhi?

1162
01:53:13,332 --> 01:53:18,332
Baisakhi? Amritsar, 1919?

1163
01:53:24,165 --> 01:53:25,747
Shashi.

1164
01:53:25,748 --> 01:53:27,289
Please call the bride and groom.

1165
01:53:27,290 --> 01:53:32,290
- Yes.

1166
01:53:32,957 --> 01:53:34,872
<i>Anu'!</i>

1167
01:53:34,873 --> 01:53:36,497
Kanan, where are you going?

1168
01:53:36,498 --> 01:53:37,706
'Anu!
'Anu!

1169
01:53:37,707 --> 01:53:39,956
- Anu, where are you going?

1170
01:53:39,957 --> 01:53:42,164
- Wait... Anu!

1171
01:53:42,165 --> 01:53:43,164
- What happened?

1172
01:53:43,165 --> 01:53:44,539
- Anu, where...

1173
01:53:44,540 --> 01:53:45,956
- Anu...Anu..

1174
01:53:45,957 --> 01:53:50,539
- Kanan, where are you off to?

1175
01:53:50,540 --> 01:53:53,081
- Where are we going?

1176
01:53:53,082 --> 01:53:54,039
What is happening, Kanan?

1177
01:53:54,040 --> 01:53:55,664
- You have no idea, right'?

1178
01:53:55,665 --> 01:53:58,206
How would you know?

1179
01:53:58,207 --> 01:54:00,622
Killed yourself like a fool.

1180
01:54:00,623 --> 01:54:01,706
Everybody knows
what happened...

1181
01:54:01,707 --> 01:54:06,081
...in Amritsar on Baisakhi day,
in 1919.

1182
01:54:06,082 --> 01:54:07,247
What?

1183
01:54:07,248 --> 01:54:12,248
[Hymn]

1184
01:54:34,540 --> 01:54:36,622
Thank you, sir.

1185
01:54:36,623 --> 01:54:40,789
I'll never forget what
you've done for Shashi and me.

1186
01:54:40,790 --> 01:54:42,664
What are you saying, son?

1187
01:54:42,665 --> 01:54:47,665
I am the lucky one. I got
to make this record for both of you.

1188
01:54:48,623 --> 01:54:49,706
I'll take your leave now.

1189
01:54:49,707 --> 01:54:53,456
But there's still some
time before your train leaves.

1190
01:54:53,457 --> 01:54:54,622
Why don't you do something?

1191
01:54:54,623 --> 01:54:57,664
I'm going to a gathering nearby.

1192
01:54:57,665 --> 01:54:58,997
Come with me.

1193
01:54:58,998 --> 01:55:03,372
And leave in time for your train.

1194
01:55:03,373 --> 01:55:05,539
Okay.

1195
01:55:05,540 --> 01:55:10,540
[Hymn]

1196
01:56:18,290 --> 01:56:23,290
Fire!

1197
01:57:13,165 --> 01:57:18,165
Shashi.

1198
01:58:06,707 --> 01:58:11,707
Is he here?

1199
01:58:11,915 --> 01:58:16,915
So many people.

1200
02:00:19,373 --> 02:00:22,789
I just took a chance.

1201
02:00:22,790 --> 02:00:27,790
I thought it was on this day...

1202
02:00:31,082 --> 02:00:36,039
- "An unfolding.
Like an unfurling of wings."

1203
02:00:36,040 --> 02:00:39,706
- "Love flies in."

1204
02:00:39,707 --> 02:00:44,707
- "Disruptive.
Breaking the dawn."

1205
02:00:47,290 --> 02:00:52,290
"With the edge of it's beak."

1206
02:00:53,665 --> 02:00:58,665
- "I have coaxed it to stay."

1207
02:01:00,415 --> 02:01:05,415
- "Fattened on sugar drops."

1208
02:01:06,123 --> 02:01:11,123
"From the tip of my tongue."

1209
02:01:17,748 --> 02:01:22,748
"I am hoping it will murmur my name."

1210
02:01:35,540 --> 02:01:40,540
"Remember me in bird song."

1211
02:01:42,748 --> 02:01:45,831
"They say it pierces it's heart."

1212
02:01:45,832 --> 02:01:50,832
"On the thorns of roses.
And blood blossoms."

1213
02:01:57,957 --> 02:02:02,957
"As eternal spring."

1214
02:02:16,915 --> 02:02:21,915
Won't you slap me today?

1215
02:06:49,498 --> 02:06:52,289
Take care of each other.

1216
02:06:52,290 --> 02:06:55,914
Forever.

1217
02:06:55,915 --> 02:07:00,915
Forever!

1218
02:08:31,290 --> 02:08:36,290
So this is what forever means.

1219
02:08:38,748 --> 02:08:41,164
I can try.

1220
02:08:41,165 --> 02:08:45,331
That's good enough.

1221
02:08:45,332 --> 02:08:50,332
That's more than enough for me.
