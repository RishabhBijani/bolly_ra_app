1
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,058
Ajay..

2
00:01:35,992 --> 00:01:38,225
If you think you have been wronged..

3
00:01:39,004 --> 00:01:40,645
Then I will help you get justice.

4
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:42,850
Stop worrying about getting
me justice, inspector.

5
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:46,600
And use all your police
force in protecting him.

6
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,975
But he won't live. I will kill him.

7
00:01:52,892 --> 00:01:54,159
I'll kill him today itself.

8
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:57,183
Whenever law will murder justice..

9
00:01:57,263 --> 00:01:59,267
A new Ajay will be born.

10
00:02:01,642 --> 00:02:03,183
Excuse me, sir..

11
00:02:03,767 --> 00:02:05,767
Instead of serving
such a judicial system..

12
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:08,607
I would rather like supporting Ajay.

13
00:02:17,222 --> 00:02:20,486
'After going through all
the aspects of this case..'

14
00:02:20,566 --> 00:02:24,430
'..the court dismisses all other
charges made on the accused Ajay..'

15
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:28,614
'..finds him guilty
only under section 302..'

16
00:02:28,694 --> 00:02:32,382
'..and sentences him
14 years of imprisonment.'

17
00:03:33,363 --> 00:03:35,530
Milk helps you make a cup of coffee.

18
00:03:35,613 --> 00:03:37,113
Milk helps you make cottage cheese.

19
00:03:37,363 --> 00:03:39,697
Similarly, seven musical notes
help you make music.

20
00:03:39,905 --> 00:03:41,822
Hey, what are you?

21
00:03:43,613 --> 00:03:47,488
Tell me, is it necessary to say
'Aayo' and 'Aito' every time?

22
00:03:47,822 --> 00:03:49,322
You are late, Kishore.

23
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:52,363
I had gone to look for
jewelry for Munni today.

24
00:03:52,675 --> 00:03:54,863
We should buy some
now that we have the money.

25
00:03:55,731 --> 00:03:58,030
If we start collecting now..

26
00:04:17,409 --> 00:04:20,322
Father, why did you throw this here?

27
00:04:22,197 --> 00:04:24,822
You should always
throw it in the dustbin.

28
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:27,238
You know that, right?

29
00:04:32,419 --> 00:04:34,090
Sorry..

30
00:05:05,579 --> 00:05:07,043
Grandpa, you won't forget
the password this time, right?

31
00:05:07,123 --> 00:05:07,743
No, I won't.

32
00:05:07,826 --> 00:05:09,034
"Nanacool."

33
00:05:09,771 --> 00:05:11,451
"Nanacool?"

34
00:05:11,784 --> 00:05:13,159
So I am cool?

35
00:05:13,995 --> 00:05:15,826
So then, I can attend the party.

36
00:05:15,971 --> 00:05:17,826
But there is an age limit.

37
00:05:18,701 --> 00:05:20,195
I mean couple entry is compulsory.

38
00:05:20,275 --> 00:05:21,618
I will be going with Anushka.

39
00:05:21,701 --> 00:05:23,743
So do you have anyone to go with you?

40
00:05:23,826 --> 00:05:24,923
With me..?
- Grandpa!

41
00:05:25,003 --> 00:05:26,996
Yes?
- Don't shut down my machines.

42
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:29,547
My project files are rendering. Okay?

43
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:32,083
Yes. You will surely
win this competition.

44
00:05:32,163 --> 00:05:33,139
Thank you.

45
00:05:33,219 --> 00:05:34,451
Let's go.
- Shall we? - Let's go.

46
00:05:34,534 --> 00:05:35,201
Bye, grandpa.
- Bye, grandpa.

47
00:05:35,284 --> 00:05:36,618
Love you. - Bye.
- Love you.

48
00:05:36,701 --> 00:05:37,493
Bye-bye.
- Let's go.

49
00:05:37,576 --> 00:05:38,451
Bye.

50
00:05:40,563 --> 00:05:43,803
Grandpa, Varun's grandma is single.

51
00:05:43,883 --> 00:05:44,579
You want me to hook you up with her?

52
00:05:44,659 --> 00:05:46,704
Imp! You will hook me up?

53
00:05:46,784 --> 00:05:47,951
Varun!

54
00:05:48,873 --> 00:05:50,409
Varun!

55
00:05:50,985 --> 00:05:53,211
Varun! Can't you hear me?

56
00:05:53,385 --> 00:05:55,947
The parties these
kids attend these days..

57
00:05:56,161 --> 00:05:58,185
..are just leading them
astray from their religion.

58
00:05:58,265 --> 00:06:02,409
He is my son. He will have
fun but he won't go astray.

59
00:06:02,489 --> 00:06:04,185
Yes, of course. I know everything.

60
00:06:04,265 --> 00:06:08,518
Varun, you can break a few rules.

61
00:06:08,598 --> 00:06:10,913
But never break our trust.
- Sure.

62
00:06:10,993 --> 00:06:11,913
Here the key??
- Sure.

63
00:06:11,993 --> 00:06:14,217
Brother.. Say hi to Zoya.

64
00:06:14,721 --> 00:06:17,852
Zoya? Are you there?

65
00:06:21,497 --> 00:06:22,456
Zoya.

66
00:06:23,622 --> 00:06:26,414
I am asking you something.
- No, mom.

67
00:06:26,497 --> 00:06:27,997
So irresponsible.

68
00:06:29,872 --> 00:06:31,956
Did he call?
- Yes, he did.

69
00:06:33,164 --> 00:06:34,581
What did he say?

70
00:06:35,164 --> 00:06:38,831
Zoya? I am asking you something, Zoya.

71
00:06:39,872 --> 00:06:40,997
Zoya.

72
00:06:41,206 --> 00:06:43,622
Listen mom,
you have Zack's number, right?

73
00:06:44,122 --> 00:06:46,001
Call him.
And ask all this crap yourself.

74
00:06:46,081 --> 00:06:47,122
Okay, dear.

75
00:06:47,456 --> 00:06:49,039
Now come on the camera.

76
00:06:49,122 --> 00:06:50,414
Let me see your sweet face..

77
00:06:50,497 --> 00:06:52,206
Before the flight takes off.

78
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:56,251
It's weird, mom.

79
00:06:56,331 --> 00:06:57,251
What's weird?

80
00:06:57,331 --> 00:07:01,126
We stay in the same house
but still we chat over Skype.

81
00:07:01,206 --> 00:07:04,607
Come on, Zoya. Now don't begin
with the whole thing all over again.

82
00:07:05,353 --> 00:07:08,497
You too must be wondering,
my mom and dad are never together..

83
00:07:08,872 --> 00:07:10,331
Then how did I come into this world?

84
00:07:10,607 --> 00:07:12,414
Come on, Zoya.

85
00:07:12,871 --> 00:07:15,122
Yes, I got downloaded
into their life by mistake.

86
00:07:15,331 --> 00:07:16,519
Am I right, Skype?

87
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:17,951
Let's go. Bye.

88
00:07:20,936 --> 00:07:22,769
Go easy with the butter, Joe.

89
00:07:22,977 --> 00:07:24,737
It's butter chicken, darling.

90
00:07:24,817 --> 00:07:26,721
I cannot change the recipe.

91
00:07:26,801 --> 00:07:29,089
Too much butter will kill you.

92
00:07:29,809 --> 00:07:34,171
The thing I love cannot kill me.

93
00:07:34,504 --> 00:07:39,588
Neither this, nor this and nor this.

94
00:07:41,296 --> 00:07:42,546
So I am come last, huh?

95
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:44,588
Last but not the least.

96
00:07:45,629 --> 00:07:46,796
Listen..

97
00:07:47,296 --> 00:07:48,921
I want to go to Nanded.

98
00:07:49,379 --> 00:07:51,463
I want you to come with me.

99
00:07:51,546 --> 00:07:52,796
For a long drive.

100
00:07:53,046 --> 00:07:54,588
For your RTR?

101
00:07:54,713 --> 00:07:55,421
No.

102
00:07:58,213 --> 00:08:03,046
"Come, let me take you.."
- No Joe, I have to finish this.

103
00:08:03,129 --> 00:08:06,588
"To a new world.."
- No.

104
00:08:08,171 --> 00:08:09,463
Good evening.
- Good evening, sir.

105
00:08:11,921 --> 00:08:12,508
Good evening, sir.

106
00:08:12,588 --> 00:08:13,213
Good evening.

107
00:08:13,296 --> 00:08:16,171
A sensational movement
for women's security and respect.

108
00:08:16,588 --> 00:08:17,713
Change it.
- But sir..

109
00:08:18,129 --> 00:08:19,004
Good evening, sir.

110
00:08:19,171 --> 00:08:20,296
Good evening.

111
00:08:20,379 --> 00:08:21,004
Good evening, sir.

112
00:08:21,088 --> 00:08:21,963
Good evening.

113
00:08:26,379 --> 00:08:28,213
You have seen our
newspaper's logo, right?

114
00:08:28,296 --> 00:08:30,504
Yes. But everything
written in it is true.

115
00:08:30,588 --> 00:08:33,088
Then why do you need
to use words like sensational.

116
00:08:33,504 --> 00:08:36,379
Such words give more weight
to lies and not the truth.

117
00:08:42,629 --> 00:08:43,713
D.C.P. Ashraf..

118
00:08:44,796 --> 00:08:46,504
Okay. Thank you, Raman.

119
00:08:46,588 --> 00:08:49,213
Oh God.
- Of course.

120
00:08:49,421 --> 00:08:53,879
Mr. Rajguru,
Ashraf is going to create a problem.

121
00:08:54,296 --> 00:08:57,254
He will approach the
media and cause a problem.

122
00:08:58,004 --> 00:09:01,713
Mr. Sinha, you worry unnecessarily.

123
00:09:02,713 --> 00:09:05,296
It will be an issue
if Herald makes it.

124
00:09:05,588 --> 00:09:07,588
But the Herald is with you.

125
00:09:08,004 --> 00:09:10,064
Let's go.
- Come on.

126
00:09:12,129 --> 00:09:13,754
Come on.
- Let's go.

127
00:09:14,488 --> 00:09:15,838
Mr. Sinha..

128
00:09:16,546 --> 00:09:19,966
Girls from small
town want to go ahead..

129
00:09:20,046 --> 00:09:21,633
But they don't know how to walk.

130
00:09:21,713 --> 00:09:24,504
You are right, sir. You are absolutely right.
- No, let's go.

131
00:09:24,588 --> 00:09:26,536
Come on. Let's have same fun.
- Cheers!

132
00:09:39,546 --> 00:09:41,713
Why are you all clapping for me?

133
00:09:41,796 --> 00:09:43,713
It's a prayer.

134
00:09:44,588 --> 00:09:47,546
Ananya, why don't you
tell them the meaning?

135
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,963
It means: oh God,
please guide us..

136
00:09:51,043 --> 00:09:53,336
From untruth to truth.

137
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:55,472
From darkness to light.

138
00:09:55,552 --> 00:09:57,671
From death to eternity.

139
00:09:57,751 --> 00:09:59,838
Let there be peace all over.

140
00:09:59,918 --> 00:10:01,796
Right, grandma?
- Yes, dear.

141
00:10:01,952 --> 00:10:04,546
You are absolutely right.
- Okay, okay. Attention everyone.

142
00:10:04,626 --> 00:10:06,004
Lights off.

143
00:10:18,712 --> 00:10:20,338
Come, come, come.

144
00:10:23,496 --> 00:10:24,963
Blow, blow, blow.

145
00:10:25,552 --> 00:10:29,171
Once more.
- Happy birthday to you.

146
00:10:35,432 --> 00:10:39,129
To papa..
- Happy birthday dear Ananya.

147
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,463
Now to grandma.

148
00:10:50,796 --> 00:10:53,254
Actually, C.M. had kept
an urgent meeting in Delhi.

149
00:10:53,338 --> 00:10:54,963
I said, it's my daughter's
birthday so I need to be there.

150
00:10:55,046 --> 00:10:57,921
Actually, my kids had come
to meet the film stars and cricketers.

151
00:10:58,004 --> 00:10:59,463
You didn't invite them?

152
00:10:59,836 --> 00:11:03,796
My Ananya knows that you
get happiness when you share them.

153
00:11:03,876 --> 00:11:06,463
Look how she is sharing happiness..

154
00:11:06,546 --> 00:11:09,669
..with the kids from our foundation.
- Come on.

155
00:11:13,856 --> 00:11:16,149
Nice. Wow.

156
00:11:24,065 --> 00:11:26,638
Nayar has been trying to hack
into our system since afternoon.

157
00:11:26,718 --> 00:11:29,254
He doesn't know that all
his data is being downloaded.

158
00:11:30,142 --> 00:11:31,593
You keep playing with Nayar.

159
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:35,905
Look, I have done my job.

160
00:11:36,854 --> 00:11:37,913
Sir..

161
00:11:44,622 --> 00:11:47,413
Your swing is too stiff, dad.
- It slipped.

162
00:11:48,247 --> 00:11:50,413
But I have the perfect
thing to loosen you up.

163
00:11:50,622 --> 00:11:51,705
Check this out.

164
00:11:52,288 --> 00:11:53,372
Good night, dad.

165
00:11:54,288 --> 00:11:55,247
What is it?

166
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:58,997
From the telecom ministry's server
they got tomorrow's bid's document.

167
00:11:59,077 --> 00:12:00,455
We got the tender, Kaka Sahib.

168
00:12:00,538 --> 00:12:03,830
Anything that belongs to
the government, belongs to you.

169
00:12:05,497 --> 00:12:07,538
Why did you need to hack into it?

170
00:12:07,622 --> 00:12:10,288
This is Kabir's first
independent project.

171
00:12:10,455 --> 00:12:13,291
And as you know,
if wants something, he gets it.

172
00:12:13,497 --> 00:12:15,251
Right here, right now.

173
00:12:19,037 --> 00:12:20,162
- Hey bro, what's up!

174
00:12:20,246 --> 00:12:21,643
Good to see you.
- Join the party.

175
00:12:21,723 --> 00:12:24,195
I've been working on this
music for the past few days.

176
00:12:27,755 --> 00:12:29,711
Hello, beautiful.
- Hey.

177
00:12:29,961 --> 00:12:31,044
Whoa!

178
00:12:31,985 --> 00:12:33,505
Hey, yo!

179
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:51,535
'Phoolchand Mehra, the second.'

180
00:12:51,766 --> 00:12:55,118
'If we have a son,
we will name him Phoolchand Mehra.'

181
00:12:55,702 --> 00:12:57,618
It was my grandfather's name.

182
00:12:58,243 --> 00:12:59,952
I don't like it.

183
00:13:00,202 --> 00:13:01,993
But I love it.

184
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,080
Why?

185
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:03,993
No way.

186
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:06,077
How about..

187
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:07,952
Tukaram Ganpat Rao.

188
00:13:08,035 --> 00:13:08,952
No way.

189
00:13:09,035 --> 00:13:10,202
No.

190
00:13:10,886 --> 00:13:14,022
Ajay Mehra's son will
be called Phoolchand Mehra.

191
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:16,382
I had promised my dad.

192
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:19,618
'Varsha is dead!'

193
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:21,955
'Her son is also dead!'

194
00:13:22,035 --> 00:13:24,600
'They died because of you.'

195
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,754
'I wanted to talk about
something important.'

196
00:13:30,669 --> 00:13:32,359
'Are you listening Ajay.'

197
00:13:32,653 --> 00:13:34,214
'I am worried.'

198
00:14:03,826 --> 00:14:05,362
'Balwant Rai.'

199
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:08,588
'Is anybody listening?'

200
00:14:09,656 --> 00:14:12,331
'They killed my brother.'

201
00:14:12,869 --> 00:14:14,321
'Is anyone listening?'

202
00:14:14,647 --> 00:14:18,577
Ajay, the medicine is
right in front of you and you...!

203
00:14:19,216 --> 00:14:20,484
Take it.

204
00:14:54,882 --> 00:14:57,243
Stop playing with your memories, Ajay.

205
00:15:08,938 --> 00:15:12,452
These moments that you try
to recall with your dear ones..

206
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,243
Just stop it!

207
00:15:15,115 --> 00:15:19,077
The nightmares that come with them
will take you somewhere from where..

208
00:15:19,524 --> 00:15:23,285
..no neurologist will be able
to bring you back, let alone me.

209
00:15:26,272 --> 00:15:30,202
You know that your life
isn't just yours anymore, right?

210
00:15:42,796 --> 00:15:44,840
You killed her, right? Confess it.

211
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,191
You raped her. Confess it.

212
00:15:46,271 --> 00:15:47,902
You did it, right? Tell me.

213
00:15:50,187 --> 00:15:51,704
I killed her.

214
00:15:54,366 --> 00:15:56,176
I killed her.

215
00:16:13,504 --> 00:16:15,053
Good morning, sir.

216
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:18,578
Good morning.

217
00:16:32,808 --> 00:16:34,954
Ajay, he is Inspector Pawar.

218
00:16:40,104 --> 00:16:42,731
Sir, this is the letter.

219
00:16:59,871 --> 00:17:02,178
You have to do it tomorrow.

220
00:17:02,258 --> 00:17:04,952
I've already committed.
Try to understand.

221
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:13,083
Mr. Mehra, Mr. Rajguru
is waiting for you.

222
00:17:13,163 --> 00:17:14,549
Please come.

223
00:17:20,613 --> 00:17:21,454
Come in, sir.

224
00:17:24,252 --> 00:17:25,370
Mr. Mehra..

225
00:17:25,663 --> 00:17:26,708
Hi.

226
00:17:26,788 --> 00:17:28,704
What brings you here?

227
00:17:42,014 --> 00:17:44,533
Lokesh, all clear?
- All clear, sir.

228
00:17:52,885 --> 00:17:53,829
Have a nice day.

229
00:17:54,064 --> 00:17:55,349
You too, sir.

230
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:15,454
Akshay, clear?

231
00:18:16,696 --> 00:18:18,389
Yup, all clear.

232
00:19:16,573 --> 00:19:18,541
Wait. Let the car pass.

233
00:19:19,181 --> 00:19:20,765
Can't you see?

234
00:19:21,221 --> 00:19:23,237
Let's go. Let's go.

235
00:19:56,068 --> 00:19:58,956
Ajay Mehra, you bastard!

236
00:19:59,372 --> 00:20:00,724
You bastard!

237
00:20:01,273 --> 00:20:02,607
Who the hell do you think you are?

238
00:20:02,815 --> 00:20:04,023
You want to mess with me?

239
00:20:04,148 --> 00:20:05,607
With Aditya Rajguru?

240
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:07,523
You will mess with the Daily Herald?

241
00:20:08,273 --> 00:20:11,235
After a few exposés,
you think you are someone great?

242
00:20:11,315 --> 00:20:13,110
You think you are a media mogul?

243
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:16,648
These RTA activists,
retired police officers..

244
00:20:16,732 --> 00:20:18,107
You think you can challenge
me with the help of these clowns?

245
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:19,857
You wanna mess with me! You...

246
00:20:39,316 --> 00:20:41,773
Your mother is a woman.

247
00:20:43,398 --> 00:20:45,523
Your wife is a woman.

248
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,065
A daughter..

249
00:20:48,065 --> 00:20:49,148
A sister..

250
00:20:54,076 --> 00:20:56,148
Do you recognize her?

251
00:21:05,484 --> 00:21:06,839
Read it.

252
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,951
'Papa, I thought...'

253
00:21:18,287 --> 00:21:23,263
'...I'll come to Mumbai,
get a job and support you.'

254
00:21:23,548 --> 00:21:28,207
I'll become a journalist and be the
voice of all the girls in this country.

255
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:32,523
But my boss Aditya Rajguru..

256
00:21:32,908 --> 00:21:35,232
'...who is exactly your age.'

257
00:21:35,764 --> 00:21:39,279
Killed my voice.

258
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:51,015
'He took advantage of my trust.'

259
00:21:51,972 --> 00:21:54,644
'He raped...'

260
00:22:02,828 --> 00:22:05,647
'I don't want to live anymore, papa.'

261
00:22:11,004 --> 00:22:17,095
'How will I ever face you,
or my fiancé Shrikant?'

262
00:22:17,756 --> 00:22:20,399
'I am sorry, papa.'

263
00:22:20,479 --> 00:22:23,167
'Please forgive me.'

264
00:22:31,092 --> 00:22:33,071
What does this prove?

265
00:22:39,412 --> 00:22:40,999
I didn't kill her.

266
00:23:01,892 --> 00:23:02,915
Doctor..

267
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:07,312
Between a rapist and
an innocent boy's DNA..

268
00:23:07,392 --> 00:23:09,142
There is a difference, right?

269
00:23:12,225 --> 00:23:13,354
Sorry, sir.

270
00:23:13,434 --> 00:23:14,923
Please forgive me.

271
00:23:15,003 --> 00:23:17,766
The three suspects of
reporter Renu Sharma's rape.

272
00:23:17,948 --> 00:23:20,474
First: The owner of the Daily Herald,
the rapist, Aditya Rajguru.

273
00:23:20,724 --> 00:23:24,641
The entire country is shocked by the shameful
deed of such high-profiled socialites.

274
00:23:24,721 --> 00:23:25,849
Dr. Poonawala.

275
00:23:25,929 --> 00:23:28,474
Instead of Rajguru's DNA sample...

276
00:23:28,554 --> 00:23:31,335
...he presented Renu's
boyfriend Srikant's sample..

277
00:23:31,415 --> 00:23:32,561
...and made a false report.

278
00:23:32,641 --> 00:23:35,936
Police commissioner Saurabh Sinha.
He destroyed all the evidences.

279
00:23:36,016 --> 00:23:37,769
He tortured Srikant..

280
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:39,099
And forced him to confess..

281
00:23:39,182 --> 00:23:41,019
That he raped Renu Sharma.

282
00:23:41,099 --> 00:23:44,831
S.I. Pawar was instrumental in
Ajay Mehra's unraveling of the case.

283
00:23:45,015 --> 00:23:48,183
This is the biggest and most Sensational
expose done by Mr. Ajay Mehra.

284
00:23:48,263 --> 00:23:51,019
He had torn the suicide note
on being pressurized by his seniors.

285
00:23:51,099 --> 00:23:53,307
But later S.I. Pawar realized..

286
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:54,891
That he too has a daughter.

287
00:23:54,974 --> 00:23:56,647
Ajay Mehra has done it again.

288
00:23:56,807 --> 00:23:58,632
How does he do it time and again?
- May Ajay Mehra livelong.

289
00:23:58,712 --> 00:24:01,103
We will disclose this secret in some time.
- So that our daughters stay safe.

290
00:24:01,183 --> 00:24:04,144
This was Mumbai police's job,
but Ajay Mehra did it.

291
00:24:04,224 --> 00:24:06,432
Ajay Mehra should also be in Delhi.

292
00:24:06,516 --> 00:24:08,519
Only then will our girls be safe.

293
00:24:08,599 --> 00:24:12,292
I will regain the trust
people have lost in Mumbai police.

294
00:24:12,372 --> 00:24:13,394
'We used to give sleepless nights...

295
00:24:13,474 --> 00:24:15,511
...and now Ajay Mehra
has done the same to us.'

296
00:24:15,591 --> 00:24:17,143
'Our boss has been arrested...'

297
00:24:17,223 --> 00:24:19,319
'...but keep listening
to Radio Herald uninterrupted.'

298
00:24:19,399 --> 00:24:21,315
The market today opened
with Herald shares..

299
00:24:21,395 --> 00:24:24,250
..taking a 47% dip in the value.

300
00:24:24,532 --> 00:24:26,998
Experts are predicting
a further fall ahead.

301
00:24:27,078 --> 00:24:28,266
That's great.

302
00:24:29,363 --> 00:24:31,807
Dad, Herald media group is now ours.

303
00:24:32,964 --> 00:24:33,932
That's good, Kabir.

304
00:24:45,516 --> 00:24:47,515
Wow!
Butter chicken!

305
00:24:48,584 --> 00:24:49,627
Ajay Mehra...

306
00:24:52,766 --> 00:24:56,057
That's why you are my
favorite doctor, Ms. Riya.

307
00:24:56,141 --> 00:25:00,141
Because you know how
to keep your patients happy.

308
00:25:01,432 --> 00:25:02,807
Well done, my boy.

309
00:25:02,891 --> 00:25:04,099
Joe!

310
00:25:04,932 --> 00:25:06,394
What are you doing?

311
00:25:06,474 --> 00:25:09,141
Meet them.

312
00:25:09,557 --> 00:25:10,891
Hello.
- Hello.

313
00:25:10,974 --> 00:25:12,141
Hi, dear.

314
00:25:12,307 --> 00:25:15,141
Ajay! I am feeling so proud of you.

315
00:25:15,641 --> 00:25:17,266
Come, come, come.

316
00:25:19,763 --> 00:25:22,827
Every woman in this world
must be praying for you today.

317
00:25:25,259 --> 00:25:26,932
Wonderful.

318
00:25:29,867 --> 00:25:30,891
Let him eat.

319
00:25:30,974 --> 00:25:32,099
It's okay to have it sometimes.

320
00:25:32,182 --> 00:25:33,141
Sometimes?

321
00:25:33,221 --> 00:25:34,352
He eats it every day.

322
00:25:34,432 --> 00:25:35,186
Hey!

323
00:25:35,266 --> 00:25:37,963
Sir, what's the progress
of Nanded's case?

324
00:25:38,232 --> 00:25:40,395
Did RTA reply?

325
00:25:41,808 --> 00:25:43,099
Yes.

326
00:25:44,672 --> 00:25:46,141
I had to go there as well.

327
00:25:46,416 --> 00:25:49,019
I asked the principal to come along..

328
00:25:49,099 --> 00:25:50,840
..we would work as
well as romance a little.

329
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,516
Romance?
- So?

330
00:25:53,088 --> 00:25:54,024
Eat.

331
00:25:54,104 --> 00:25:55,807
You should go with him.

332
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:57,304
Long drives, outings.

333
00:25:57,384 --> 00:25:59,352
Don't listen to him, Riya.

334
00:25:59,432 --> 00:26:02,328
He always has a hidden agenda.

335
00:26:02,952 --> 00:26:06,160
Last time he took my friends
with him to Latur for an outing.

336
00:26:06,568 --> 00:26:09,163
Once there, he parked the
car outside the collectorate..

337
00:26:09,243 --> 00:26:11,622
..he gave us some
plank cards to hold..

338
00:26:11,702 --> 00:26:16,202
..and asked us if we could
protest with him for a while.

339
00:26:16,952 --> 00:26:18,118
I was so embarrassed.

340
00:26:18,202 --> 00:26:19,952
What are you saying?
- Yeah.

341
00:26:20,618 --> 00:26:22,077
Did you really do that?

342
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,285
I killed her.
- She is lying. - What?

343
00:26:24,577 --> 00:26:29,618
I humbly asked them whether
they could protest for a while.

344
00:26:30,085 --> 00:26:31,910
They rudely said "no"!

345
00:26:32,533 --> 00:26:34,955
I said fine. - I won't let
anything happen to you. Trust me.

346
00:26:35,035 --> 00:26:36,247
I killed her, mother.

347
00:26:36,327 --> 00:26:37,827
I killed her.

348
00:26:38,827 --> 00:26:42,622
As you can see Srikant
who was excruciated by the police..

349
00:26:42,702 --> 00:26:45,497
..has lost his mental balance
completely.

350
00:26:45,577 --> 00:26:47,997
You can see that he is very scared.

351
00:26:48,077 --> 00:26:50,118
And that police has
tortured him a lot.

352
00:26:53,021 --> 00:26:54,872
I killed her.
- You didn't do anything.

353
00:26:54,952 --> 00:26:56,368
I killed her.

354
00:26:58,035 --> 00:27:00,789
I.. I killed her.
- I am right here with you.

355
00:27:02,765 --> 00:27:04,410
I.. I killed her.

356
00:27:06,035 --> 00:27:08,216
I.. I killed her.

357
00:27:08,368 --> 00:27:09,368
Renu..

358
00:27:09,536 --> 00:27:11,122
Renu..
- Yes?

359
00:27:11,202 --> 00:27:12,702
Renu.. you are here!
- Just relax.

360
00:27:12,785 --> 00:27:14,008
I have been trying to
explain it to them..

361
00:27:14,088 --> 00:27:15,202
Lie down.

362
00:27:15,285 --> 00:27:16,785
I didn't kill you.
- Nothing will happen to you.

363
00:27:16,868 --> 00:27:19,288
I didn't kill you.
You are not Renu. - Just relax.

364
00:27:19,368 --> 00:27:20,327
Where is Renu?

365
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:22,247
Where is Renu?
You are not Renu!

366
00:27:22,327 --> 00:27:23,955
Where is Renu?
Relax Shrikant.

367
00:27:24,035 --> 00:27:25,955
I want Renu!

368
00:27:26,035 --> 00:27:27,327
Renu!

369
00:27:45,557 --> 00:27:47,661
He'll get 10 more electric shocks?

370
00:27:47,741 --> 00:27:48,952
It's not electric shocks.

371
00:27:49,035 --> 00:27:52,035
It's a therapy which
is very important for him.

372
00:27:54,256 --> 00:27:55,437
Look at Ajay.

373
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,202
His case was very serious.

374
00:27:58,743 --> 00:28:00,910
I want to die.
I want to die.

375
00:28:01,368 --> 00:28:02,618
I want to die.

376
00:28:03,035 --> 00:28:04,618
Kill me. Let me die.

377
00:28:04,827 --> 00:28:06,077
Die. I want to die.

378
00:28:06,785 --> 00:28:09,261
Kill me. Kill me.

379
00:28:09,702 --> 00:28:11,288
I want to die.

380
00:28:11,368 --> 00:28:12,663
Kill me.

381
00:28:12,743 --> 00:28:14,118
Kill me.

382
00:28:14,452 --> 00:28:16,202
Be careful.

383
00:28:16,285 --> 00:28:18,752
Calm down.

384
00:28:27,243 --> 00:28:28,757
Are you feeling all right?

385
00:28:30,877 --> 00:28:32,421
Ajay?
- Varsha?

386
00:28:36,229 --> 00:28:37,453
Relax, Ajay.
- You are not Varsha.

387
00:28:37,533 --> 00:28:39,372
Ward boys!
- You are not Varsha.

388
00:28:39,452 --> 00:28:42,565
Prepare the E.C.T.
- 'Varsha! I want to go to Varsha'

389
00:28:42,645 --> 00:28:43,445
Relax.

390
00:28:43,525 --> 00:28:45,785
'I want to die.
I want to go to Varsha'

391
00:28:46,072 --> 00:28:49,765
After the death of his wife and kids,
he turned suicidal.

392
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,493
But look at him now.

393
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,910
He is absolutely fine.

394
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:58,002
Srikant's case is not that serious.

395
00:28:58,085 --> 00:28:59,960
He will get well in a few months.

396
00:29:00,252 --> 00:29:05,043
But he can get well
only when you and others..

397
00:29:05,127 --> 00:29:08,210
..that is, his friends and
family behave positively with him.

398
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:11,210
We will need to give him a new aim.

399
00:29:11,558 --> 00:29:14,918
When he will get a new aim,
his new life with begin.

400
00:29:23,668 --> 00:29:24,960
What are you thinking?

401
00:29:26,877 --> 00:29:32,168
Superintendent said that
my term here is coming to an end.

402
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,543
I will be released next year.

403
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:41,585
What will I do once I go outside?

404
00:29:42,543 --> 00:29:45,043
The things which
others can't do, Ajay.

405
00:29:45,752 --> 00:29:51,630
Not everyone has the strength
to endure and to fight as you do.

406
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:53,210
He is right, Ajay.

407
00:29:53,585 --> 00:29:57,081
And when we are with
you then your aim is close by.

408
00:29:57,668 --> 00:30:00,502
An aim..
- Ajay..

409
00:30:00,582 --> 00:30:05,052
Why don't we get out of here
and help those who are helpless..

410
00:30:05,132 --> 00:30:06,252
Alone..

411
00:30:06,335 --> 00:30:08,002
And feel defeated by the system.

412
00:30:09,377 --> 00:30:10,543
Ajay?

413
00:30:11,694 --> 00:30:13,210
They are leaving.

414
00:30:17,238 --> 00:30:19,526
Your son will get well.

415
00:30:20,046 --> 00:30:21,776
Just like me.

416
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:24,817
We will always be grateful to you.

417
00:30:24,897 --> 00:30:26,126
Thank you, sir.

418
00:30:26,206 --> 00:30:26,982
Thank you.

419
00:30:27,062 --> 00:30:28,276
Thank you.

420
00:30:33,126 --> 00:30:36,118
Ajay, we're getting late. Shall we?

421
00:30:36,478 --> 00:30:40,614
Let me call on stage,
Mr. Ajay Satyakant Mehra.

422
00:30:40,694 --> 00:30:45,776
He should come here and give
the bravery award to these brave kids.

423
00:30:47,488 --> 00:30:51,071
I fell into the fast flowing
water while doing river rafting..

424
00:30:51,321 --> 00:30:55,030
..but these stupid kids saved my life.

425
00:30:57,696 --> 00:30:59,696
Zoya Sehgal.

426
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:02,158
Varun Jain.

427
00:31:02,238 --> 00:31:03,280
My son.

428
00:31:04,071 --> 00:31:05,863
Thank you. Thank you so much.
- Rohan Kriplani.

429
00:31:05,946 --> 00:31:07,173
Yeah!

430
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:11,530
Thank you. Thank you, sir.
- Anushka Kulkarni.

431
00:31:13,071 --> 00:31:15,155
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.

432
00:31:16,989 --> 00:31:19,530
Please share a few
words with these kids.

433
00:31:27,863 --> 00:31:30,655
All I would like to say is..

434
00:31:31,946 --> 00:31:34,196
If we are going to support the truth..

435
00:31:35,381 --> 00:31:38,491
..then we shouldn't
give up until we win.

436
00:31:38,571 --> 00:31:41,075
Yes, sir. We won't give up.

437
00:31:41,155 --> 00:31:44,363
Yes, sir. We won't give up.

438
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:47,155
Yes, sir. We won't give up.

439
00:31:47,571 --> 00:31:49,155
Well said, Ajay.

440
00:31:49,235 --> 00:31:51,405
You are sharing great
knowledge with these kids.

441
00:31:51,488 --> 00:31:55,283
According to this, our kids
should keep doing such stupid things.

442
00:31:55,363 --> 00:31:57,658
See, that wasn't so hard.
- Ajay sir..

443
00:31:57,738 --> 00:31:59,488
I am Zoya.
Zoya Sehgal.

444
00:32:00,196 --> 00:32:02,446
Alnoor sir knows me.
I am a blogger.

445
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:03,991
Pretending parents.

446
00:32:04,071 --> 00:32:05,446
You have read my blog?

447
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:06,741
Sir, I am a big fan.

448
00:32:06,821 --> 00:32:08,155
Can I get a selfie with you?

449
00:32:08,238 --> 00:32:09,155
Sure.
- Hello.

450
00:32:09,238 --> 00:32:10,488
Yes.
- Come on.

451
00:32:10,568 --> 00:32:14,037
"Just jump and grab it."

452
00:32:17,738 --> 00:32:22,446
"Just jump and grab it."

453
00:32:26,238 --> 00:32:27,613
"A delicate string.. "

454
00:32:28,155 --> 00:32:29,530
"The heart sings."

455
00:32:30,238 --> 00:32:33,155
"May be for others,
we don't bother."

456
00:32:34,113 --> 00:32:35,655
"Everyday.."

457
00:32:36,113 --> 00:32:38,030
"It's today.."

458
00:32:38,155 --> 00:32:40,696
"It has nothing to do with tomorrow."

459
00:32:40,988 --> 00:32:44,571
"Sadness, hold a sharp knife."

460
00:32:44,863 --> 00:32:48,669
"How can we avoid
difficulties in our lives?"

461
00:32:48,821 --> 00:32:52,749
"We will change the
direction of the wind."

462
00:32:52,829 --> 00:32:56,491
"We will live our lives as we will."

463
00:32:56,571 --> 00:32:57,366
"Friends.."

464
00:32:57,446 --> 00:33:01,530
"Just jump and grab it."

465
00:33:04,863 --> 00:33:09,488
"Just jump and grab it."

466
00:33:37,158 --> 00:33:38,366
"Feeling low."

467
00:33:39,116 --> 00:33:40,574
"Just let it blow."

468
00:33:41,116 --> 00:33:43,866
"It's useless to sulk."

469
00:33:45,005 --> 00:33:48,241
"Build your own opportunities.."

470
00:33:48,991 --> 00:33:51,616
"That's our funda, our principle."

471
00:33:51,783 --> 00:33:55,575
"Just jump and grab happiness."

472
00:33:55,795 --> 00:33:59,675
"Juice it, life is nothing
but like a fresh orange."

473
00:33:59,755 --> 00:34:03,555
"We will change the
direction of the wind."

474
00:34:03,635 --> 00:34:07,465
"We will live our lives as we will."

475
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:12,366
"Just jump and grab it."

476
00:34:15,533 --> 00:34:20,366
"Just jump and grab it."

477
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:27,658
"The power of our fists.."

478
00:34:28,344 --> 00:34:31,407
"We will be our take."

479
00:34:31,875 --> 00:34:35,491
"All the crooked rules.."

480
00:34:36,225 --> 00:34:39,421
"We will break."

481
00:34:39,501 --> 00:34:41,158
"We are not kids,
don't mistake."

482
00:34:41,283 --> 00:34:43,199
"We are not weak, won't break."

483
00:34:43,279 --> 00:34:45,461
"Whatever, whatever it is."

484
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:47,369
"Back off people."

485
00:34:47,449 --> 00:34:49,036
"Don't stop us."

486
00:34:49,116 --> 00:34:51,085
"Chill, don't nag us."

487
00:34:51,165 --> 00:34:53,421
"Whatever, whatever it is."

488
00:34:53,501 --> 00:34:56,741
"Stop bugging us like this."

489
00:34:56,824 --> 00:35:01,869
"Friends, just jump and grab it."

490
00:35:05,333 --> 00:35:09,885
"Just jump and grab it."

491
00:35:13,677 --> 00:35:17,501
"A friend, a dear friend.."

492
00:35:17,581 --> 00:35:20,877
"If becomes a special friend."

493
00:35:21,525 --> 00:35:24,942
"Like a gift, godsend."

494
00:35:25,364 --> 00:35:28,317
"Will be with you till the end."

495
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,983
"With a companion,
the journey becomes beautiful."

496
00:35:32,063 --> 00:35:36,036
"How can we stay
away from each other?"

497
00:35:36,116 --> 00:35:39,900
"We will change the
direction of the wind."

498
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:43,868
"We will live our lives as we will."

499
00:35:43,948 --> 00:35:49,067
"Friends, just jump and grab it."

500
00:35:51,988 --> 00:35:56,858
"Just jump and grab it."

501
00:36:00,332 --> 00:36:04,858
"Just jump and grab it."

502
00:36:04,942 --> 00:36:08,233
"Just jump.. and grab it."

503
00:36:08,358 --> 00:36:12,608
"Just jump and grab it."

504
00:36:12,692 --> 00:36:15,900
"Just jump.. and grab it."

505
00:36:15,983 --> 00:36:18,692
"Just jump and grab it."

506
00:36:18,775 --> 00:36:20,901
"Just jump and grab it."

507
00:36:20,981 --> 00:36:22,309
Grandpa!

508
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:24,422
My baby.

509
00:36:24,502 --> 00:36:26,150
How are you?

510
00:36:26,636 --> 00:36:28,159
You look tired.

511
00:36:28,239 --> 00:36:29,285
I am so tired.

512
00:36:29,365 --> 00:36:31,320
And now we have to spend
the whole night editing.

513
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,977
Order a few pizzas for us.

514
00:36:33,057 --> 00:36:34,533
We will be working
through the night. Okay?

515
00:36:34,613 --> 00:36:35,460
Okay, bye.

516
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:37,060
Through the night?
But you are tired.

517
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:38,647
Grandpa.. keep Skype with you.
- Okay.

518
00:36:38,727 --> 00:36:40,190
Feed him.
- Okay.

519
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:41,508
Don't feed him grapes, okay?

520
00:36:41,588 --> 00:36:43,012
How can I feed him grapes?

521
00:36:43,233 --> 00:36:45,111
Strange girl.
- How are you, grandpa?

522
00:36:45,191 --> 00:36:47,274
I am starving.
I am famished.

523
00:36:47,354 --> 00:36:49,483
Okay. What do you want?

524
00:36:49,566 --> 00:36:51,441
Order 2 cheeseburgers
and coke for me.

525
00:36:51,524 --> 00:36:52,274
Order pizza.

526
00:36:52,399 --> 00:36:54,149
I want to 2 burgers.

527
00:36:54,358 --> 00:36:57,399
Please.
- Okay. I am your grandpa.

528
00:36:57,853 --> 00:36:59,175
And not your grandma.

529
00:36:59,255 --> 00:37:00,569
What are you saying?

530
00:37:00,649 --> 00:37:01,899
Still, you will get everything.
- Give me the remote.

531
00:37:01,983 --> 00:37:04,233
Put the match on.
There is a match going on. - Take it.

532
00:37:07,316 --> 00:37:08,819
Hey can you read that?

533
00:37:08,899 --> 00:37:11,028
Utterly, butterly chicken.

534
00:37:11,108 --> 00:37:14,115
Exactly, it suits you perfectly.

535
00:37:56,392 --> 00:37:59,080
Ajay, the accident that
took place on Pen Highway...

536
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,782
D'Souza sir's car was in it.

537
00:38:09,009 --> 00:38:12,387
Sir, there were 8-10 more
people apart from Joe sir.

538
00:38:12,467 --> 00:38:16,009
And the tanker driver
was also burnt to death.

539
00:38:20,967 --> 00:38:22,259
Ajay, sister-in-law..

540
00:38:24,717 --> 00:38:26,262
Joe!

541
00:38:26,342 --> 00:38:27,467
Joe!

542
00:38:28,051 --> 00:38:29,759
I want to see Joe.

543
00:38:30,176 --> 00:38:31,342
Oh, my God!

544
00:38:31,723 --> 00:38:32,967
Joe!

545
00:38:38,467 --> 00:38:41,509
Joe! No, Joe! No, Joe!

546
00:38:42,691 --> 00:38:45,346
Joe! My Joe! I want to go..

547
00:38:45,426 --> 00:38:46,929
Let me just see him once.

548
00:38:47,009 --> 00:38:50,929
Let me.. oh my God.
- 'An Accident on Mumbai-Pen Highway.'

549
00:38:51,009 --> 00:38:54,387
We have got information
that 8-10 died in this accident.

550
00:38:54,467 --> 00:38:57,801
Former deputy commissioner
and RTI activist..

551
00:38:57,884 --> 00:38:59,643
..Joe D'Souza...

552
00:39:25,124 --> 00:39:27,434
'This incident..'
- Guys! Guys, he killed him.

553
00:39:27,514 --> 00:39:28,472
Joe D'Souza!
- Who?

554
00:39:28,555 --> 00:39:30,430
The RTI activist. Kabir shot him.

555
00:39:30,514 --> 00:39:31,545
Shit, he killed him.

556
00:39:31,625 --> 00:39:32,494
Shit.

557
00:39:32,574 --> 00:39:36,367
I was watching this and suddenly the..
- What happened? - Look at this grandpa.

558
00:39:38,619 --> 00:39:39,409
Raj Bansal.

559
00:39:39,489 --> 00:39:41,286
And that's Kaka Sahib,
that's the home minister. - Shit.

560
00:39:41,369 --> 00:39:42,494
I am going to blog this right now

561
00:39:42,578 --> 00:39:43,536
No, Zoya.
- Why?

562
00:39:43,619 --> 00:39:45,536
It will take only two seconds
to trace its IP address.

563
00:39:45,619 --> 00:39:46,536
Exactly.
- Shit.

564
00:39:46,619 --> 00:39:47,911
We should give it to the police.

565
00:39:47,994 --> 00:39:48,703
Have you lost your mind?

566
00:39:48,786 --> 00:39:49,998
The home minister himself
is involved in this.

567
00:39:50,078 --> 00:39:50,994
Ajay Mehra.

568
00:39:51,078 --> 00:39:52,994
We need to take this to Ajay Mehra.
- No!

569
00:39:53,869 --> 00:39:55,744
No Ajay Mehra.
No!

570
00:39:55,828 --> 00:39:57,619
No one will tell anything to anyone.

571
00:39:57,703 --> 00:39:59,536
You guys don't know anything.

572
00:39:59,616 --> 00:40:00,578
Come with me.

573
00:40:00,658 --> 00:40:04,703
This is the biggest ever road
accident on Mumbai-Pen Highway so far.

574
00:40:04,786 --> 00:40:07,498
8-10 people are believed
to have died in it.

575
00:40:07,578 --> 00:40:08,244
What?

576
00:40:08,328 --> 00:40:10,702
You saw that? - Former deputy
commissioner and RTI activist..

577
00:40:10,782 --> 00:40:12,100
Are you getting it?

578
00:40:12,254 --> 00:40:16,748
They turned a murder into an accident.

579
00:40:16,828 --> 00:40:19,161
They killed 8-10 people.

580
00:40:19,830 --> 00:40:22,998
These images might disturb you.
- Rohan, call up your father.

581
00:40:23,422 --> 00:40:24,721
And ask him to come here immediately.

582
00:40:24,804 --> 00:40:26,342
Yeah, my dad.

583
00:40:26,422 --> 00:40:30,513
It's clear that the Pen Highway
accident in which our founder...

584
00:40:30,596 --> 00:40:33,470
...and other 10 people died..

585
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:36,054
..happened due to the
mistake of the tanker driver..

586
00:40:36,138 --> 00:40:38,474
..and road department's mismanagement.
- Very good.

587
00:40:38,554 --> 00:40:41,058
Satyakam family prays
for Joe D'Souza and..

588
00:40:41,138 --> 00:40:44,558
Mr. Bansal.. good riddance.

589
00:40:44,638 --> 00:40:46,974
Troy is just great.

590
00:40:47,054 --> 00:40:50,516
He killed 11 people
along with D'Souza.

591
00:40:50,596 --> 00:40:54,894
That made the accident
quite convincing.

592
00:40:54,974 --> 00:40:58,641
And the way Satyakam confirmed it..

593
00:40:58,721 --> 00:41:00,974
Now I am relaxed.

594
00:41:01,054 --> 00:41:03,694
I am relaxed.
- Good night.

595
00:41:06,888 --> 00:41:07,971
'You socialist rats!'

596
00:41:08,054 --> 00:41:09,263
'Bloody anarchists!'

597
00:41:09,346 --> 00:41:11,013
'What is your contribution
in this country's growth?

598
00:41:11,096 --> 00:41:12,398
'We are the ones who create wealth.'

599
00:41:12,478 --> 00:41:13,974
'We are the ones
who provide employment.'

600
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:15,474
'We are the ones who
are feeling you all.'

601
00:41:15,554 --> 00:41:17,263
'You always create hurdles for us.'

602
00:41:17,346 --> 00:41:18,304
'All of you should die.'

603
00:41:18,388 --> 00:41:20,014
'And I will kill all of you.'

604
00:41:26,138 --> 00:41:27,138
Where is papa?

605
00:41:27,221 --> 00:41:28,070
Over there.

606
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:29,221
Ananya!
- Ananya!

607
00:41:29,304 --> 00:41:30,888
Slow down, dear.

608
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:33,846
Papa!

609
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:39,166
Look at this, papa.

610
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:42,433
Mom got an award.
I, too, went on the stage.

611
00:41:42,513 --> 00:41:44,286
Why didn't you come here?

612
00:41:45,054 --> 00:41:47,798
Dear, I was.. Prema..

613
00:41:47,878 --> 00:41:50,304
Ananya, you have to
go to school in the morning.

614
00:41:50,388 --> 00:41:51,974
Say good night to everyone.

615
00:41:52,054 --> 00:41:53,814
Good night, papa.
- Good night.

616
00:41:54,102 --> 00:41:56,388
Good night, grandma.
- Good night, dear.

617
00:41:57,304 --> 00:41:58,622
Good night, mom.

618
00:41:58,888 --> 00:42:00,174
Good night, Ananya.

619
00:42:00,254 --> 00:42:04,198
What's wrong, son?
You look upset.

620
00:42:04,494 --> 00:42:08,942
Nothing, mother.
It's just.. You should go and rest.

621
00:42:18,104 --> 00:42:19,862
What is wrong, Raj?

622
00:42:20,666 --> 00:42:25,796
Actually, today, I realized that
the huge empire that my dad built..

623
00:42:26,898 --> 00:42:32,482
..our legacy, our son
won't be able to take it ahead.

624
00:42:37,488 --> 00:42:38,548
Why do you say that?

625
00:42:38,934 --> 00:42:41,341
I wish you could
witness his anger today.

626
00:42:41,813 --> 00:42:44,210
He shot a man today.
And the way he shot..

627
00:42:44,290 --> 00:42:45,483
Shot? What do you mean?

628
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:47,837
What do you mean by shot?
He killed someone?

629
00:42:48,526 --> 00:42:49,579
Yes.

630
00:42:49,659 --> 00:42:50,936
But the murder has been taken care of.

631
00:42:51,016 --> 00:42:53,117
What are you saying?
- But the murder has been taken care of.

632
00:42:53,197 --> 00:42:54,468
I told you not to give him a gun.

633
00:42:54,548 --> 00:42:55,712
This is not about the gun.
- I had told you..

634
00:42:55,792 --> 00:42:57,504
Tomorrow he kills
someone with his car..

635
00:42:57,587 --> 00:42:59,126
..will you question
me why did I give him a car?

636
00:42:59,206 --> 00:43:01,504
I will! I surely will!
- Please try to understand.

637
00:43:02,828 --> 00:43:05,328
I am shocked by the rage
with which he killed that man.

638
00:43:05,578 --> 00:43:07,286
His attitude, his thoughts..

639
00:43:07,536 --> 00:43:10,620
How will he run such a
big empire with so much anger?

640
00:43:10,703 --> 00:43:12,703
We have failed as parents.

641
00:43:12,995 --> 00:43:14,536
What kind of an upbringing
have you given him?

642
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:15,915
Me?
- Yes, you.

643
00:43:15,995 --> 00:43:18,081
I..
- You are his mother.

644
00:43:18,161 --> 00:43:20,370
You never let me be a mother, Raj.

645
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:22,828
I was just a nanny to your prince.

646
00:43:23,370 --> 00:43:27,828
I gave birth to him,
but he got all his values from you.

647
00:43:28,163 --> 00:43:32,963
You didn't stop him when he
insulted his elders or the servants.

648
00:43:33,213 --> 00:43:37,286
You gave him everything he wanted.

649
00:43:37,703 --> 00:43:41,373
You made such a big
Bansal world for prince..

650
00:43:41,453 --> 00:43:44,411
..that he thought that he has
a right to anything and everything.

651
00:43:44,626 --> 00:43:46,203
You are responsible for it.

652
00:43:46,474 --> 00:43:47,828
You have made him a..

653
00:43:49,258 --> 00:43:51,036
You have made him a murderer.

654
00:44:02,789 --> 00:44:04,093
This is everything?
- Yes. - Yes, dad.

655
00:44:04,173 --> 00:44:05,370
There is nothing left behind with you?
- No.

656
00:44:05,453 --> 00:44:06,554
You sure?
- Yes, sir.

657
00:44:06,634 --> 00:44:08,703
Let's go.
- Uncle..

658
00:44:09,317 --> 00:44:11,067
But what are you going to do?

659
00:44:12,935 --> 00:44:15,237
Dear, you know that
I am a lawyer, right?

660
00:44:15,317 --> 00:44:16,103
Yes.

661
00:44:16,183 --> 00:44:18,692
I will do what you want to do.

662
00:44:19,199 --> 00:44:20,817
But in my own way.

663
00:44:23,223 --> 00:44:24,743
Another thing:

664
00:44:24,823 --> 00:44:28,031
You won't mention this to anyone.

665
00:44:29,692 --> 00:44:31,196
Promise?
- Yes, uncle.

666
00:44:31,276 --> 00:44:33,067
Yes, uncle.
- Let's go. - Okay.

667
00:44:47,995 --> 00:44:50,454
Doomed. Oh damn..

668
00:44:55,814 --> 00:44:57,787
What a piece of crap!

669
00:44:57,934 --> 00:45:01,326
This makes it look as if
we are killing him on purpose.

670
00:45:02,286 --> 00:45:04,036
But it was not so.

671
00:45:04,494 --> 00:45:05,994
Well done, Kaka Sahib.

672
00:45:06,078 --> 00:45:10,078
You invited the very person
I came here to complain about.

673
00:45:10,158 --> 00:45:12,078
Mr. D'Souza..

674
00:45:12,158 --> 00:45:16,119
You've made a good name for
yourself with your RTI applications.

675
00:45:16,199 --> 00:45:17,744
It's time to call it quits.

676
00:45:18,161 --> 00:45:20,206
Now it's time to join
hands and move ahead.

677
00:45:20,286 --> 00:45:22,369
Kaka Sahib,
how many times do I have to tell you..

678
00:45:22,661 --> 00:45:25,411
I don't wear a uniform anymore.
I am retired.

679
00:45:25,944 --> 00:45:29,578
Hence, I am no longer
forced to follow your orders.

680
00:45:30,424 --> 00:45:32,869
I have instead gotten
into a habit of following up.

681
00:45:35,994 --> 00:45:36,994
Look at this.

682
00:45:37,074 --> 00:45:41,661
3452 families which you have ruined.

683
00:45:42,161 --> 00:45:47,164
Rehabilitate their homes, farms
and animals and the problem is solved.

684
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:48,453
Mr. D'Souza..

685
00:45:49,203 --> 00:45:53,331
We have given them the compensation
government has ordered us to.

686
00:45:53,411 --> 00:45:56,369
You haven't given them anything,
you have fooled them.

687
00:45:57,619 --> 00:45:59,661
In exchange of a mere compensation,

688
00:45:59,744 --> 00:46:02,328
you've stolen the lands of those
illiterate poor people.

689
00:46:02,411 --> 00:46:03,619
Come on, Mr. D'Souza.

690
00:46:03,828 --> 00:46:06,289
People will get employment
because of the project.

691
00:46:06,369 --> 00:46:08,328
If they don't die due
to starvation by then.

692
00:46:08,661 --> 00:46:11,539
Everything that we did was
done with government approval.

693
00:46:11,619 --> 00:46:13,953
Which government
are you talking about?

694
00:46:14,203 --> 00:46:17,956
The government that
dances naked to your tunes?

695
00:46:18,036 --> 00:46:21,498
How dare you talk to my father
like that, you rotten slave?

696
00:46:21,578 --> 00:46:22,623
What did you say?

697
00:46:22,703 --> 00:46:25,536
Leave me. - This is what
your father wants to make us.

698
00:46:25,619 --> 00:46:26,827
Mr. D'Souza.
- Leave me.

699
00:46:26,907 --> 00:46:29,039
The government too is your slave.
- Leave me.

700
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,994
Water, electricity, phone network..
- Leave me..

701
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:32,453
Everything belongs to you.
- Leave me or I'll kill you.

702
00:46:32,536 --> 00:46:33,661
Everything belongs to your father.

703
00:46:33,744 --> 00:46:36,039
The only thing left is
his image on the currency.

704
00:46:36,119 --> 00:46:37,536
You are making this country..

705
00:46:39,074 --> 00:46:40,324
Now do you understand?

706
00:46:40,766 --> 00:46:42,407
Yes. I completely understand.

707
00:46:42,657 --> 00:46:44,490
You are not at fault, son.

708
00:46:44,859 --> 00:46:47,240
It is justified. Justified, he is.

709
00:46:47,449 --> 00:46:51,324
Joe D'Souza is such a man that
this was bound to happen eventually.

710
00:46:51,407 --> 00:46:53,532
Hence, I brought everything over here.

711
00:46:53,615 --> 00:46:57,486
Mr. Kriplani, what do you mean to say?

712
00:46:57,845 --> 00:47:00,366
That you have not
made any copies of it?

713
00:47:00,725 --> 00:47:02,952
What? What are you saying?

714
00:47:03,032 --> 00:47:05,032
You must have kept
one for safety sake.

715
00:47:05,455 --> 00:47:06,657
You are accusing me.

716
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:08,490
You are a lawyer.

717
00:47:10,032 --> 00:47:12,202
You are getting me wrong. I..

718
00:47:12,282 --> 00:47:14,202
Look Mr. Raj, I am a corporate lawyer.

719
00:47:14,282 --> 00:47:16,740
You know me. I did all this..

720
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:18,532
Kaka Sahib is making
an accusation on me.

721
00:47:18,615 --> 00:47:20,449
Relax Kriplani.
- I did all this for you.

722
00:47:20,532 --> 00:47:21,449
Relax.

723
00:47:21,862 --> 00:47:25,702
He is just reassuring.
And I trust you.

724
00:47:25,782 --> 00:47:27,490
And I appreciate your gesture.
- Thank you.

725
00:47:27,574 --> 00:47:29,949
Very shortly, you will receive
a call from my accounts department.

726
00:47:30,115 --> 00:47:31,157
No.

727
00:47:31,782 --> 00:47:33,282
Why are you taking it the wrong way?

728
00:47:33,365 --> 00:47:34,740
Look, you are getting it all wrong.

729
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:36,407
I didn't do all this for the money.

730
00:47:36,490 --> 00:47:39,577
Mr. Kriplani, control yourself.
No, no. Mr. Kriplani, please.

731
00:47:39,657 --> 00:47:41,785
This is the reason I brought
all these things with me. - Calm down.

732
00:47:41,865 --> 00:47:44,199
I spoke about the money just
as a good gesture on our part.

733
00:47:44,282 --> 00:47:45,267
No, I don't want any money.

734
00:47:45,347 --> 00:47:46,907
You don't have to
worry about anything.

735
00:47:46,987 --> 00:47:48,285
Please relax.
- Mr. Kriplani..

736
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:52,153
I hope you don't mind sharing a few
details of those four kids with us.

737
00:47:52,783 --> 00:47:54,463
They won't utter a word
about this to anyone, sir.

738
00:47:54,543 --> 00:47:57,500
Mr. Kriplani,
Troy is our security chief. - Okay.

739
00:47:57,580 --> 00:47:59,246
It's just a regular security drill.

740
00:47:59,330 --> 00:48:01,023
You don't need to feel scared.

741
00:48:01,103 --> 00:48:03,996
Like you said, my son is
just like your own son.. - Absolutely.

742
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:07,333
Similarly,
your son is my life my own son.

743
00:48:07,413 --> 00:48:08,746
Okay, relax.

744
00:48:09,038 --> 00:48:09,916
Yeah?

745
00:48:09,996 --> 00:48:12,246
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

746
00:48:12,621 --> 00:48:13,538
Thank you.

747
00:48:21,163 --> 00:48:22,163
This guy..

748
00:48:22,538 --> 00:48:24,000
He is too funny.

749
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:25,205
Kabir..

750
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:28,666
I'm damned..

751
00:48:28,746 --> 00:48:31,503
Stop worrying about your son.

752
00:48:31,583 --> 00:48:33,815
We will have to stay alert now.

753
00:48:34,126 --> 00:48:37,296
You know why no one
has ever touched D'Souza?

754
00:48:37,379 --> 00:48:39,362
Because he had Ajay Mehra's support.

755
00:48:39,442 --> 00:48:42,879
He is very stubborn. You don't know
what kind of a person Ajay Mehra is.

756
00:48:42,959 --> 00:48:47,039
Balwant Rai was once
where you are now.

757
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:49,967
He killed Ajay Mehra's brother.

758
00:48:50,047 --> 00:48:54,943
The entire Mumbai police, D'Souza
and his men provided him security.

759
00:48:55,023 --> 00:48:57,796
But no one was able
to stop Ajay Mehra.

760
00:48:57,879 --> 00:48:59,762
He gave him 24 hours.

761
00:48:59,842 --> 00:49:03,587
He went inside Balwant
Rai's house and shot him.

762
00:49:04,048 --> 00:49:08,289
And he also killed all
those who were with him.

763
00:49:08,369 --> 00:49:10,577
He killed all of them.

764
00:49:10,896 --> 00:49:13,077
He is a crazy stubborn guy.

765
00:49:14,936 --> 00:49:18,928
Mr. Bansal, he killed everyone.

766
00:49:19,008 --> 00:49:21,039
Did you hear me?

767
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:23,286
You don't know what Ajay Mehra is.

768
00:49:23,369 --> 00:49:24,327
Who is this Ajay Mehra?

769
00:49:24,411 --> 00:49:27,327
I am thinking about my son
and you are talking about Ajay Mehra.

770
00:49:27,411 --> 00:49:29,327
Who the hell is this Ajay Mehra?

771
00:49:33,286 --> 00:49:35,077
'Why are you staring?'

772
00:49:36,411 --> 00:49:38,577
'Honesty never dies.'

773
00:49:39,411 --> 00:49:44,119
'When a corrupt person dies,
his rein ends.'

774
00:49:44,702 --> 00:49:49,619
'But when an honest man dies,
his rein begins.'

775
00:49:50,369 --> 00:49:53,202
'Satyakams never dies.'

776
00:50:03,577 --> 00:50:05,702
Morning, mom. Morning, dad.
- Good morning.

777
00:50:05,782 --> 00:50:06,831
See you in court.
- Sure, sir.

778
00:50:06,911 --> 00:50:07,702
Morning.

779
00:50:07,994 --> 00:50:09,869
Dad, what did you do with that video?

780
00:50:10,545 --> 00:50:12,215
I mean what's the progress?

781
00:50:12,295 --> 00:50:13,420
My friends were asking..

782
00:50:13,503 --> 00:50:16,128
..as we haven't heard any
news about them getting arrested so..

783
00:50:16,211 --> 00:50:18,045
Eat this.
- Yes, I'll eat it.

784
00:50:18,295 --> 00:50:20,128
So what's the progress, dad?

785
00:50:20,908 --> 00:50:24,128
Rohan, the progress is
that I have made all of you safe.

786
00:50:24,211 --> 00:50:28,086
Safe? - And I am sure, this
is what other parents wanted as well.

787
00:50:28,336 --> 00:50:30,628
Aren't you getting late?
- Yes. Let's go.

788
00:50:30,753 --> 00:50:31,628
Dad?

789
00:50:32,044 --> 00:50:33,795
Dad! Dad, wait!

790
00:50:34,045 --> 00:50:37,795
Rohan.. - But what
does making us safe mean?

791
00:50:38,571 --> 00:50:41,711
I gave the video to the
ones to whom it belonged.

792
00:50:43,147 --> 00:50:45,795
Kabir Bansal murdered Mr. D'Souza.

793
00:50:46,461 --> 00:50:48,961
And you gave the evidence to him?

794
00:50:49,339 --> 00:50:52,420
Rohan, it's..
- Dad.. dad, he is wrong.

795
00:50:52,503 --> 00:50:53,753
What is wrong?

796
00:50:55,170 --> 00:50:56,461
Is it wrong to be a father?

797
00:50:57,295 --> 00:50:58,753
Is it wrong to save your family?

798
00:50:59,166 --> 00:51:02,628
No, dad. But it wrong to
be scared of the wrong people.

799
00:51:02,795 --> 00:51:04,378
And you are a lawyer!

800
00:51:04,628 --> 00:51:06,420
You stand for truth and justice.

801
00:51:06,503 --> 00:51:08,170
Truth and justice?

802
00:51:09,878 --> 00:51:11,795
You know what is
truth and justice today?

803
00:51:12,336 --> 00:51:15,586
Today truth and justice is Raj Bansal.

804
00:51:16,961 --> 00:51:21,461
Raj Bansal,
today, is truth and justice!

805
00:51:22,461 --> 00:51:24,659
He must be having
his own reasons, Rohan.

806
00:51:25,011 --> 00:51:27,586
He must be genuinely
afraid of Mr. Bansal.

807
00:51:28,187 --> 00:51:29,170
He's a powerful man.

808
00:51:29,250 --> 00:51:30,795
Anushka is right, Rohan.

809
00:51:31,045 --> 00:51:32,545
How is she right?

810
00:51:32,961 --> 00:51:35,755
If a lawyer of his stature
cannot bring justice to someone..

811
00:51:35,907 --> 00:51:38,336
..then how can a common man
hope for anything in this country?

812
00:51:38,819 --> 00:51:40,628
And our parents are so duplicitous.

813
00:51:40,963 --> 00:51:43,086
They teach us one thing and
they do something just the opposite.

814
00:51:43,170 --> 00:51:45,045
Pretending parents.
- What?

815
00:51:45,295 --> 00:51:46,878
Pretending parents.

816
00:51:48,045 --> 00:51:49,211
You are right, Zoya.

817
00:51:49,418 --> 00:51:50,878
Pretending parents.

818
00:51:51,174 --> 00:51:53,461
That day we should have
given that video to Ajay Mehra.

819
00:51:53,541 --> 00:51:55,419
Then what are you waiting for?

820
00:51:55,499 --> 00:51:57,003
I have taken a backup of that video.

821
00:51:57,086 --> 00:51:59,586
Zoya? When? How did you do it?

822
00:52:00,211 --> 00:52:01,753
What are we waiting for? Let's go.

823
00:52:13,051 --> 00:52:14,881
He will now stay in the
military academy, mother.

824
00:52:14,961 --> 00:52:18,627
I'm the one who spoilt him, so I'll be
the one who will get him back on track.

825
00:52:41,547 --> 00:52:43,420
No.
- Call him again.

826
00:52:46,643 --> 00:52:48,961
You have a problem bending
before your elders as well?

827
00:52:49,331 --> 00:52:50,420
Touch her feet properly.

828
00:52:50,954 --> 00:52:52,115
Go on.

829
00:52:56,739 --> 00:53:02,461
Your manners help you
win the world and not your ego.

830
00:53:09,411 --> 00:53:10,253
He is not answering it?

831
00:53:12,795 --> 00:53:13,787
Yes, Zoya?

832
00:53:13,867 --> 00:53:15,227
Hello, Alnoor sir..

833
00:53:15,307 --> 00:53:16,336
Can I please speak to Ajay Mehra?

834
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:17,779
Any emergency?

835
00:53:17,859 --> 00:53:20,170
Sir, Joe D'Souza didn't die
in an accident. He was murdered.

836
00:53:20,253 --> 00:53:21,173
What?

837
00:53:21,253 --> 00:53:23,187
And we have the evidence.
- Are you sure?

838
00:53:23,323 --> 00:53:26,170
Yes, sir.
Can we please talk to Ajay Mehra?

839
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:30,503
Troy, kids have a copy of the evidence.
And they are going to Ajay Mehra.

840
00:53:30,586 --> 00:53:31,420
Copy that.

841
00:53:31,503 --> 00:53:33,631
Mr. Bansal, the kids
have the copy of the evidence.

842
00:53:33,711 --> 00:53:36,211
And they have made
contact with Ajay Mehra.

843
00:53:37,629 --> 00:53:38,545
Ajay..

844
00:53:40,399 --> 00:53:41,628
There is an emergency.

845
00:53:52,707 --> 00:53:54,370
Hello, Zoya..
- Sir! Ajay sir!

846
00:53:54,450 --> 00:53:56,959
Raj Bansal's son,
Kabir Bansal murdered him.

847
00:53:57,039 --> 00:53:58,228
We have the proof, sir.

848
00:53:58,308 --> 00:53:59,990
What? Whose murder?

849
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:03,070
We went to Karnala bird
sanctuary to make a documentary.

850
00:54:03,153 --> 00:54:07,678
One of our cameras captured
Kabir Bansal shooting at Joe D'Souza.

851
00:54:07,758 --> 00:54:11,511
Our home minister Kaka Sahib and
Raj Bansal were also present there.

852
00:54:11,910 --> 00:54:13,754
Do you know what you are saying?
Are you sure about it?

853
00:54:13,834 --> 00:54:15,526
Yes, sir. We have the proof.

854
00:54:15,606 --> 00:54:17,818
This incident took place
in a farmhouse in Karnala.

855
00:54:17,898 --> 00:54:18,696
Where are you?

856
00:54:18,776 --> 00:54:20,068
In college, sir.

857
00:54:20,482 --> 00:54:21,943
Hello, sir, I am Rohan.

858
00:54:22,026 --> 00:54:23,359
Rohan, do you know where my office is?

859
00:54:23,439 --> 00:54:25,359
Yes, sir.
- Go there. I'm coming here.

860
00:54:25,443 --> 00:54:26,026
Okay.

861
00:54:26,109 --> 00:54:27,318
Let's go. Let's go, guys.

862
00:54:27,401 --> 00:54:29,193
Call Kaka Sahib and Kriplani as well.
- Yes, sir.

863
00:54:29,276 --> 00:54:30,613
What's happening, Raj?

864
00:54:30,693 --> 00:54:32,234
You had said that
everything would be fine.

865
00:54:32,484 --> 00:54:33,401
What's going on? Tell me something.

866
00:54:33,484 --> 00:54:35,318
Sheetal, please. - Ajay Mehra
is at Mt. Mary Church, Bandra.

867
00:54:35,401 --> 00:54:36,401
Do whatever you have to do.

868
00:54:36,481 --> 00:54:38,151
Just make sure that
Kabir stays unharmed.

869
00:54:38,234 --> 00:54:39,859
I don't let any harm come to my son.
Don't worry, Sheetal. - Zoya is at Pedar Road.

870
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:41,318
And we are here.

871
00:54:41,401 --> 00:54:43,026
Joshi, what are you waiting for?

872
00:54:43,109 --> 00:54:44,568
You didn't call Kaka saheb?

873
00:54:44,651 --> 00:54:46,196
Zoya has left ?

874
00:54:46,276 --> 00:54:48,438
You can catch them here.
At Senapati Bapat Road.

875
00:54:48,518 --> 00:54:50,026
Keep me posted.
- Yes, sir.

876
00:54:50,246 --> 00:54:51,568
I'll get the kids.
- Get them.

877
00:55:11,026 --> 00:55:12,109
Yes, Mr. Bansal?

878
00:55:12,193 --> 00:55:15,464
Income tax, service tax,
IT cell, narcotics department..

879
00:55:15,544 --> 00:55:18,113
Use all the departments
and seize Ajay Mehra's office..

880
00:55:18,193 --> 00:55:20,859
..his press and all his properties,
Immediately.

881
00:55:21,149 --> 00:55:23,029
Why? What happened?

882
00:55:23,109 --> 00:55:24,401
Another copy of that
video has showed up.

883
00:55:24,484 --> 00:55:26,071
The kids are going
to give it to Ajay Mehra.

884
00:55:26,151 --> 00:55:28,162
Why are you putting me in a fix?

885
00:55:28,242 --> 00:55:29,276
Just shut up.

886
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:31,192
Just do as I say.

887
00:55:36,356 --> 00:55:39,321
Kriplani,
if you had given me all the copies..

888
00:55:39,401 --> 00:55:41,672
..then which copy are the
kids going to give to Ajay Mehra?

889
00:55:41,752 --> 00:55:42,818
There is no other copy of it,
Mr. Bansal.

890
00:55:42,901 --> 00:55:45,029
Are you playing with me?
- No, not at all.

891
00:55:45,109 --> 00:55:47,484
Stop your son,
or else I will kill him.

892
00:55:47,568 --> 00:55:48,568
No!

893
00:55:54,943 --> 00:55:55,776
Sir. Jai Hind, sir.

894
00:55:55,856 --> 00:55:56,526
Yes, Jai Hind.

895
00:55:56,609 --> 00:55:59,276
Income tax,
service tax, narcotics department..

896
00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:01,568
..has raided Ajay Mehra's Satyakam.

897
00:56:01,651 --> 00:56:02,571
Ajay Mehra?

898
00:56:02,651 --> 00:56:04,734
Yes, he has messed up big time.

899
00:56:08,675 --> 00:56:10,746
Sir, Rohan is not
taking Kriplani's call.

900
00:56:13,288 --> 00:56:15,744
I need your personal supervision.

901
00:56:15,824 --> 00:56:18,205
Put surveillance on Ajay
Mehra and all his men right away.

902
00:56:18,288 --> 00:56:20,705
Troy, you need to be faster.

903
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:23,705
Your dad is calling.
- Don't answer it.

904
00:56:24,706 --> 00:56:27,538
Sir, there is only a distance of
800 yards between Troy and the kids.

905
00:56:28,623 --> 00:56:29,798
Yes, Kriplani?

906
00:56:29,878 --> 00:56:30,995
Hello, Kulkarni?
- Yes.

907
00:56:31,075 --> 00:56:32,163
Call up Anushka right away.

908
00:56:32,246 --> 00:56:33,926
Rohan is not answering my phone.
- What happened?

909
00:56:34,006 --> 00:56:35,487
They have made a copy of that video.

910
00:56:35,567 --> 00:56:37,777
The kids are going to give
it to Ajay Mehra. - A copy?

911
00:56:37,857 --> 00:56:38,583
To Ajay Mehra?

912
00:56:38,663 --> 00:56:41,163
Call her up right away,
or all of them will die.

913
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:45,121
They have taken a left
to Senapati Bapat Road.

914
00:56:47,648 --> 00:56:48,931
Grandpa?

915
00:56:49,011 --> 00:56:50,996
Hello, grandpa?
- What have you done!

916
00:56:51,076 --> 00:56:52,745
From where did you get that copy?

917
00:56:52,825 --> 00:56:55,336
You are going to give
that copy to Ajay Mehra?

918
00:56:55,416 --> 00:56:57,830
You won't give that
copy to Ajay Mehra.

919
00:56:58,472 --> 00:57:00,433
You will instead go straight
to Kriplani's house.

920
00:57:00,513 --> 00:57:01,413
Okay, grandpa.

921
00:57:03,648 --> 00:57:04,996
400 yards.

922
00:57:05,446 --> 00:57:07,455
What happened?
- He is furious.

923
00:57:07,596 --> 00:57:10,901
He has told me not to go
to Ajay Mehra with the hard drive.

924
00:57:10,981 --> 00:57:12,413
200 yards..

925
00:57:13,970 --> 00:57:16,578
I don't get one thing,
how did he learn that..

926
00:57:16,658 --> 00:57:18,500
..we are going to Ajay
Mehra with the hard disk?

927
00:57:18,580 --> 00:57:21,746
Obviously,
Bansal is tapping our phones.

928
00:57:21,830 --> 00:57:24,093
What?
- How else would he know?

929
00:57:25,129 --> 00:57:26,288
100 yards..

930
00:57:32,205 --> 00:57:33,371
Troy, where are you going?

931
00:57:33,455 --> 00:57:35,907
You have just crossed them.
- Stop them.

932
00:57:42,928 --> 00:57:44,728
Now what?
- Who are they?

933
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:47,640
Guys, they are Bansal's men.
- Oh shit.

934
00:57:53,216 --> 00:57:55,188
No!
- Rohan!

935
00:57:57,872 --> 00:57:59,560
Call Ajay Mehra, now!

936
00:58:08,608 --> 00:58:09,496
Yes, Zoya?

937
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:10,832
Ajay sir..

938
00:58:10,912 --> 00:58:13,240
Bansal's men are attacking us.

939
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:16,376
Sir, our phones are being tapped.
What should we do?

940
00:58:22,008 --> 00:58:22,928
Where are you?

941
00:58:23,008 --> 00:58:24,512
Where are we?

942
00:58:25,024 --> 00:58:26,330
Hang on!

943
00:58:31,752 --> 00:58:32,746
Guys! Where are we, guys?

944
00:58:32,830 --> 00:58:34,000
Phoenix Mall.

945
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:36,008
Phoenix Mall's parking lot, sir.

946
00:58:36,088 --> 00:58:38,600
Don't worry, Zoya.
First of all, destroy your SIM cards.

947
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:39,705
I'll come there as soon as possible.

948
00:58:39,788 --> 00:58:41,240
Destroy your SIM cards.

949
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:42,824
Give me your phones.

950
00:58:42,904 --> 00:58:44,205
Destroy your SIM cards.

951
00:58:45,608 --> 00:58:48,840
Akshay, there's an
emergency at Phoenix Mall.

952
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:50,448
Four kids are in trouble.

953
00:58:50,528 --> 00:58:51,791
Send help immediately.

954
00:58:51,871 --> 00:58:52,746
Okay, sir.

955
00:59:05,576 --> 00:59:08,968
Bansal has foreign militants
in his security, right?

956
00:59:09,048 --> 00:59:10,455
Highly trained foreigners.

957
00:59:51,253 --> 00:59:53,128
We're going to die, Rohan.

958
00:59:53,878 --> 00:59:55,089
I can't do anything.

959
00:59:55,169 --> 00:59:58,103
Do something.
- It's stuck...it's stuck.

960
00:59:59,015 --> 01:00:00,703
Rohan, the car. Rohan.

961
01:00:20,368 --> 01:00:21,952
Rohan..
- It's not starting.

962
01:00:22,032 --> 01:00:23,410
Skype..

963
01:00:23,555 --> 01:00:24,705
Let's get out. Let's go.
- Skype..

964
01:00:24,785 --> 01:00:26,035
Come on.

965
01:00:27,379 --> 01:00:28,660
Oh no!

966
01:00:33,401 --> 01:00:34,612
They are coming.
- Oh shit!

967
01:00:34,692 --> 01:00:36,196
We need to go.
- Come on. Let's go.

968
01:00:36,276 --> 01:00:37,359
Not that way.

969
01:00:37,442 --> 01:00:38,487
Up..
- Run.

970
01:00:38,567 --> 01:00:39,859
Guys, I am bleeding.

971
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:41,901
Guys, I am bleeding.

972
01:00:42,683 --> 01:00:43,734
Shit..

973
01:00:48,537 --> 01:00:49,859
Oh my God!

974
01:00:53,662 --> 01:00:55,192
No, Rohan!
- No, Rohan!

975
01:00:55,276 --> 01:00:56,526
No!
- No, Rohan!

976
01:00:58,620 --> 01:01:00,526
If we are going to support the truth..

977
01:01:00,810 --> 01:01:03,359
..we aren't going
to give up until we win.

978
01:01:04,550 --> 01:01:06,134
If we are going to support the truth..

979
01:01:06,384 --> 01:01:08,300
..we aren't going
to give up until we win.

980
01:01:09,717 --> 01:01:11,217
If we are going to support the truth..

981
01:01:11,342 --> 01:01:13,550
..we aren't going
to give up until we win.

982
01:01:30,967 --> 01:01:32,509
Come on. Let's go.

983
01:01:33,050 --> 01:01:35,009
My leg!

984
01:01:35,634 --> 01:01:37,804
Varun, hurry up. They are coming.

985
01:01:37,884 --> 01:01:40,759
Come on! Come on! Come on!
- Let's go guys, come on.

986
01:01:41,259 --> 01:01:42,550
Rohan come!

987
01:01:44,550 --> 01:01:46,217
Have you got them, Troy?

988
01:01:46,300 --> 01:01:47,675
I'll get the kids, sir.

989
01:01:48,884 --> 01:01:50,217
Get the car down.

990
01:01:57,717 --> 01:01:59,055
You two, you go straight.
- Okay sir.

991
01:01:59,135 --> 01:01:59,679
You go up.

992
01:01:59,759 --> 01:02:00,675
Yes, sir.

993
01:02:01,134 --> 01:02:02,834
Give me the live feed of Phoenix Mall.
- Yes, sir.

994
01:02:03,217 --> 01:02:03,884
Come, come on.

995
01:02:03,967 --> 01:02:05,592
Troy, go to the security room.

996
01:02:05,675 --> 01:02:07,134
Don't worry. I am on it.

997
01:02:08,509 --> 01:02:09,967
What's wrong?

998
01:02:16,717 --> 01:02:18,595
Stop.
- We have reached the mall, sir.

999
01:02:18,675 --> 01:02:20,759
These guys are here too.

1000
01:02:23,342 --> 01:02:24,800
We need to keep going, guys.

1001
01:02:26,092 --> 01:02:27,217
Let's go. Let's go.

1002
01:02:33,634 --> 01:02:35,425
Come on guys let's go
- I'm coming.

01:02:35,509 --> 01:02:36,717
Let's go. Let's go.

01:02:40,759 --> 01:02:42,800
Who are you?
- Don't worry.

1005
01:02:43,134 --> 01:02:44,300
I am Satyakam.

1006
01:02:45,033 --> 01:02:46,967
Ajay Mehra had called.
He is on his way.

1007
01:02:47,128 --> 01:02:48,175
Come with me.

1008
01:02:48,883 --> 01:02:49,970
It's okay, guys. Come.
- It's okay, guys.

1009
01:02:50,050 --> 01:02:50,925
Come. Come on.

1010
01:02:52,373 --> 01:02:54,189
Boys, they have gone
into Mother Earth.

1011
01:02:54,481 --> 01:02:55,602
You think we are safe here?

1012
01:02:55,682 --> 01:02:57,898
Yes. Ajay Mehra will soon be here.

1013
01:02:58,274 --> 01:03:00,606
You are bleeding too much.
- Water.

1014
01:03:00,686 --> 01:03:02,218
Uncle, do you have
the first-aid box? - Yes.

1015
01:03:02,298 --> 01:03:04,314
Get some tissues, please.
- You all right? - Yeah.

1016
01:03:05,137 --> 01:03:07,273
Close the shutter.
- Yes, sir.

1017
01:03:07,421 --> 01:03:08,273
Close the shutter.

1018
01:03:08,540 --> 01:03:09,523
Hurry up.

1019
01:03:09,786 --> 01:03:10,773
Close the shutter.

1020
01:03:15,981 --> 01:03:17,148
Shit.
- Get up we need to move.

1021
01:03:17,231 --> 01:03:18,189
Let's go. Come on!

1022
01:03:18,269 --> 01:03:19,898
Come on. Come on.

1023
01:03:19,981 --> 01:03:21,939
Run. Run;
- Go out the back door.

1024
01:03:22,019 --> 01:03:23,023
Hey you!

1025
01:03:24,743 --> 01:03:26,425
Faster!
- Come on, guys.

1026
01:03:26,505 --> 01:03:28,064
Go, go, go.

1027
01:03:29,766 --> 01:03:31,224
Hurry up.

1028
01:03:33,432 --> 01:03:34,766
They are coming. Let's go.

1029
01:03:34,849 --> 01:03:36,557
Hurry up, Rohan!
- Go!

1030
01:03:37,932 --> 01:03:39,307
Go.
- Let's go.

1031
01:03:40,807 --> 01:03:41,849
Run, run, run.

1032
01:03:42,141 --> 01:03:43,391
Rohan.

1033
01:03:46,849 --> 01:03:48,391
Let's go.
- Go, go, go!

1034
01:03:48,891 --> 01:03:50,432
Come on, let's go.
- Rohan come on. Rohan.

1035
01:03:51,599 --> 01:03:53,766
Come on, faster.

1036
01:03:55,224 --> 01:03:56,849
Come on.
- Go.

1037
01:03:57,932 --> 01:03:59,016
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1038
01:03:59,099 --> 01:04:00,477
What happened?
- Get back!

1039
01:04:00,557 --> 01:04:02,477
Cameras.
- Cameras?

1040
01:04:02,557 --> 01:04:03,772
They are watching us.
- What?

1041
01:04:03,852 --> 01:04:05,641
That's how they knew
we were in that shop.

1042
01:04:05,721 --> 01:04:07,436
Then what should we do?

1043
01:04:07,516 --> 01:04:09,474
If we are together,
then we are one target. - Yes.

1044
01:04:09,557 --> 01:04:10,561
I think we should spilt up.

1045
01:04:10,641 --> 01:04:12,206
They won't be able to track us.
- That makes sense, guys.

1046
01:04:12,286 --> 01:04:14,224
Boys. They are all splitting up.

1047
01:04:33,905 --> 01:04:35,849
She is getting away. Faster.

1048
01:04:37,095 --> 01:04:39,057
No. No..

1049
01:04:39,309 --> 01:04:40,557
Leave me..

1050
01:04:40,637 --> 01:04:41,724
Leave me!

1051
01:04:44,188 --> 01:04:46,307
Leave me! Leave me!

1052
01:05:02,389 --> 01:05:04,132
Anushka!

1053
01:05:05,974 --> 01:05:08,307
Joshi, jam all the
signals from this mall. - Yes, sir.

1054
01:05:08,391 --> 01:05:10,557
No videos should
get uploaded from there.

1055
01:05:13,974 --> 01:05:15,116
Sachin, you missed him.

1056
01:05:15,196 --> 01:05:16,641
He's near the food court.

1057
01:05:34,307 --> 01:05:35,641
Leave me!

1058
01:05:35,905 --> 01:05:37,557
Let go of me!

1059
01:05:39,766 --> 01:05:41,060
Leave me!

1060
01:05:41,228 --> 01:05:42,932
Imran, she is right above you.

1061
01:05:43,196 --> 01:05:44,628
Leave me!

1062
01:05:46,465 --> 01:05:47,682
Oh shit!

1063
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:18,724
Rohan!

1064
01:06:21,296 --> 01:06:22,724
Rohan!

1065
01:06:25,184 --> 01:06:26,474
Rohan!

1066
01:06:32,516 --> 01:06:33,974
Rohan, be careful.

1067
01:06:38,336 --> 01:06:39,724
Come on. Move!
- Let's go!

1068
01:06:40,152 --> 01:06:41,557
Get them! Faster!

1069
01:06:43,112 --> 01:06:44,974
Hurry up, Rohan. Hurry up.

1070
01:06:47,357 --> 01:06:49,221
Boys, bring in the bikes.

1071
01:06:53,203 --> 01:06:54,909
Watch it.

1072
01:06:55,734 --> 01:06:57,301
Rohan!

1073
01:06:57,973 --> 01:07:00,182
Leave him, I say leave him.

1074
01:07:01,057 --> 01:07:02,573
Zoya!

1075
01:07:04,477 --> 01:07:05,775
Rohan, go, go, go.

1076
01:07:06,112 --> 01:07:07,400
Leave me!

1077
01:07:08,119 --> 01:07:09,524
Don't think, Rohan. Go!

1078
01:07:09,604 --> 01:07:11,442
Go, Rohan!

1079
01:07:23,146 --> 01:07:25,359
Get her to the parking lot.

1080
01:08:14,619 --> 01:08:16,109
Yes!

1081
01:08:29,749 --> 01:08:30,874
Rohan!

1082
01:08:31,207 --> 01:08:32,416
Rohan!
- Rohan!

1083
01:08:32,499 --> 01:08:33,957
Rohan!
- Rohan!

1084
01:08:34,037 --> 01:08:34,957
Rohan!

1085
01:08:35,037 --> 01:08:36,416
Can you hear me?

1086
01:08:37,166 --> 01:08:37,999
Rohan..

1087
01:08:38,078 --> 01:08:39,007
Rohan..

1088
01:08:39,087 --> 01:08:40,331
Rohan, get up.

1089
01:08:41,763 --> 01:08:46,063
Mr. Bansal, I have sealed
Satyakam and trammeled Ajay Mehra.

1090
01:08:46,143 --> 01:08:47,184
Good.

1091
01:08:49,809 --> 01:08:50,726
Ajay sir..

1092
01:08:51,117 --> 01:08:51,938
Ajay sir..

1093
01:08:52,018 --> 01:08:52,726
Sir..

1094
01:09:05,809 --> 01:09:09,027
Come on kids, let's go.
- No, I can't get up.

1095
01:09:15,283 --> 01:09:16,235
Troy!

1096
01:09:34,496 --> 01:09:35,596
Where are they?

1097
01:09:35,973 --> 01:09:37,208
Where did he go?

1098
01:09:37,475 --> 01:09:38,797
Where did they disappear?

1099
01:09:38,877 --> 01:09:41,308
They are outside the mall, sir.
There are no cameras outside.

1100
01:09:43,020 --> 01:09:44,124
Joshi.
- Yes, sir.

1101
01:09:44,205 --> 01:09:46,184
I want to talk to
the defense secretary. - Okay, sir.

1102
01:09:46,545 --> 01:09:48,505
Faster, Joshi.
- Just connecting, sir.

1103
01:09:50,296 --> 01:09:52,212
Akshay, call Riya.

1104
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:54,172
Hello?

1105
01:09:54,255 --> 01:09:56,550
I want immediate access
to the satellite images of Mumbai!

1106
01:09:56,630 --> 01:09:57,588
What are you talking?

1107
01:09:57,672 --> 01:09:59,032
I am Raj Bansal here!

1108
01:09:59,112 --> 01:10:00,090
So what?

1109
01:10:00,170 --> 01:10:03,547
You could be anybody.
It's a matter of national security.

1110
01:10:56,477 --> 01:10:57,984
Ravi, now!

1111
01:10:58,064 --> 01:10:59,422
Ashok, now!

1112
01:11:06,490 --> 01:11:09,297
Troy, have you got them?

1113
01:11:10,505 --> 01:11:11,547
Troy!

1114
01:11:12,255 --> 01:11:13,218
Have you got them?

1115
01:11:13,298 --> 01:11:14,505
No, sir.

1116
01:11:15,892 --> 01:11:17,963
How can they be so good?

1117
01:11:18,891 --> 01:11:20,797
They are the mercenaries
of truth, sir.

1118
01:11:21,763 --> 01:11:23,422
Truth fanatics.

1119
01:11:24,636 --> 01:11:26,440
Ajay Mehra's soldiers, his A-team..

1120
01:11:27,033 --> 01:11:30,024
Your paid mercenaries can
never match these mercenaries.

1121
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:31,649
What did you say?

1122
01:11:32,943 --> 01:11:34,143
Come again?

1123
01:11:37,143 --> 01:11:38,543
I've been doing cooperate..

1124
01:11:38,940 --> 01:11:41,107
..espionage and hacking
for you since the past five years.

1125
01:11:41,190 --> 01:11:42,399
That was fine.

1126
01:11:44,069 --> 01:11:46,440
We weren't harming any innocent being.

1127
01:11:49,286 --> 01:11:52,107
But what we are doing
with these kids today..

1128
01:11:53,315 --> 01:11:55,524
Sorry, sir.
I don't want to be a part of all this.

1129
01:11:55,990 --> 01:11:58,019
I am with those kids.
I am a "Satyakam".

1130
01:11:58,370 --> 01:11:59,982
Kabir! Kabir, stop. Stop.

1131
01:12:00,065 --> 01:12:02,159
Kabir! Kabir! Kabir!

1132
01:12:02,300 --> 01:12:03,741
Anyone else here is a "Satyakam"?

1133
01:12:03,881 --> 01:12:04,944
Anyone?

1134
01:12:05,610 --> 01:12:06,601
Anyone?

1135
01:12:42,344 --> 01:12:44,084
Keep it here. Here.

1136
01:12:45,152 --> 01:12:46,568
Nitin, get me some ice.

1137
01:12:47,068 --> 01:12:48,988
I think I've broken my leg.
- I think I've broken my leg.

1138
01:12:49,068 --> 01:12:51,113
Give me the antiseptic.

1139
01:12:51,193 --> 01:12:52,985
- It's just a little spirit, that's all.

1140
01:12:56,110 --> 01:12:57,818
Don't worry.

1141
01:12:58,076 --> 01:13:01,405
Ajay sir.. come with me for a minute.
- Varun, try to open your eyes.

1142
01:13:01,485 --> 01:13:02,447
It's urgent, sir. Please.
- It's paining.

1143
01:13:02,527 --> 01:13:04,193
It's urgent. Please.
- You'll be fine don't worry.

1144
01:13:04,277 --> 01:13:05,110
Open your eyes.

1145
01:13:05,193 --> 01:13:06,860
Many departments have raided together.

1146
01:13:07,068 --> 01:13:08,659
It department, central vigilance..
- What?

1147
01:13:08,739 --> 01:13:09,733
There is too much panic.

1148
01:13:09,813 --> 01:13:10,526
Have a look, sir.

1149
01:13:10,606 --> 01:13:11,447
They have seized the whole office.

1150
01:13:11,527 --> 01:13:13,027
They have arrested our people.

1151
01:13:15,241 --> 01:13:16,527
And look over here, sir.

1152
01:13:16,758 --> 01:13:18,402
Look what the news
channels are telecasting.

1153
01:13:18,482 --> 01:13:19,863
'Ajay Mehra exposed.'

1154
01:13:19,943 --> 01:13:23,447
'Sudden raids by all government departments
have put Ajay Mehra and Satyakam..'

1155
01:13:23,527 --> 01:13:25,777
Sir, there is a lot of confusion
among the members of Satyakam.

1156
01:13:25,985 --> 01:13:28,698
We are getting messages asking us,
what they should do.

1157
01:13:28,902 --> 01:13:30,780
Tell them not to panic.
- Sir..

1158
01:13:30,860 --> 01:13:33,693
How can you just sit here,
Kaka Sahib?

1159
01:13:33,943 --> 01:13:35,985
Call up the police
control room and ask them..

1160
01:13:36,068 --> 01:13:38,834
..to comb the area from
where Ajay Mehra disappeared.

1161
01:13:38,914 --> 01:13:40,915
Alert your cyber cell.
- Okay.

1162
01:13:40,995 --> 01:13:45,110
And ensure that that video
shouldn't be uploaded at any cost.

1163
01:13:45,970 --> 01:13:48,224
Media, judiciary, bureaucracy..

1164
01:13:48,304 --> 01:13:51,387
Wherever he has sympathizers,
keep them under watch.

1165
01:13:52,345 --> 01:13:55,432
Issue a red alert against
Ajay Mehra and those four kids.

1166
01:13:55,512 --> 01:13:56,929
Okay.
- Immediately.

1167
01:13:57,970 --> 01:13:58,929
All of you..

1168
01:13:59,853 --> 01:14:02,557
Hack into Ajay Mehra's
server and find out where he is.

1169
01:14:02,637 --> 01:14:04,512
How can he just disappear?

1170
01:14:05,304 --> 01:14:07,805
Akshay, where are our friends.

1171
01:14:08,397 --> 01:14:11,095
Sir, we are trying to contact them,
but we cannot.

1172
01:14:11,179 --> 01:14:13,229
Ajay sir, Rohan wants to talk to you.

1173
01:14:13,309 --> 01:14:14,245
Sir...

1174
01:14:14,512 --> 01:14:16,029
Take it easy son.
- Shit.

1175
01:14:16,261 --> 01:14:17,387
Give me that video.

1176
01:14:17,845 --> 01:14:19,220
I am sorry, sir.

1177
01:14:19,804 --> 01:14:21,733
But they cornered me in the shop..

1178
01:14:23,261 --> 01:14:24,807
So I hid the hard drive over there..

1179
01:14:24,887 --> 01:14:26,762
It's in the speaker section.

1180
01:14:27,485 --> 01:14:29,095
So that they cannot
get a hold of it.

1181
01:14:36,013 --> 01:14:36,762
Look after the kids.

1182
01:14:36,845 --> 01:14:37,845
Okay.

1183
01:14:48,958 --> 01:14:51,262
Mr. Bansal don't worry
filters are activated...

1184
01:14:51,342 --> 01:14:54,695
We won't let any comment video or
data video get uploaded against you.

1185
01:14:54,918 --> 01:14:55,954
Good.

1186
01:14:56,034 --> 01:14:58,498
Why are you guys taking so
much of time to hack into his server?

1187
01:14:58,578 --> 01:15:00,913
Do it faster.
It's been more than half an hour.

1188
01:15:01,352 --> 01:15:02,314
Look for him in every house.

1189
01:15:02,394 --> 01:15:03,939
We are almost here.
- Search each and every house.

1190
01:15:04,019 --> 01:15:06,727
If you have need to strip
everyone naked then do it.

1191
01:15:06,810 --> 01:15:09,269
I want Ajay Mehra. - Namdev,
who is heading the committee?

1192
01:15:09,352 --> 01:15:11,227
George Awasthi.
- Keep an eye on George Awasthi as well.

1193
01:15:11,307 --> 01:15:11,855
Yes, sir.

1194
01:15:11,935 --> 01:15:13,605
He's a sympathizer of Ajay Mehra.

1195
01:15:13,685 --> 01:15:16,711
Sir. - Yes, sir.
- Hello, control room.

1196
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:19,144
Send more men.

1197
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:21,519
I don't have any
idea about the location.

1198
01:15:21,599 --> 01:15:23,685
They took me in a dirty body bag..

1199
01:15:23,769 --> 01:15:26,519
..and then dumped me inside a tempo or a
truck, because I heard a shutter close.

1200
01:15:26,599 --> 01:15:30,397
After that it stopped at
a car park and they took me out.

1201
01:15:30,477 --> 01:15:34,459
Sir, he says it was a car park and
the other person says it was a school.

1202
01:15:34,539 --> 01:15:36,852
What's your full name?
- Ajay Vithal Gaekwad.

1203
01:15:38,435 --> 01:15:39,477
You are working in
the accounts department?

1204
01:15:39,560 --> 01:15:40,352
Since one year.

1205
01:15:40,432 --> 01:15:41,352
I don't know, sir.

1206
01:15:41,432 --> 01:15:43,935
I bloody hell don't want to see this.

1207
01:15:44,019 --> 01:15:48,019
Do you understand? I want
to see the bloody extortion list!

1208
01:15:49,515 --> 01:15:50,810
Where were you before this?

1209
01:15:51,352 --> 01:15:52,310
In jail.

1210
01:15:53,060 --> 01:15:54,522
With Ajay Mehra?
- Yes.

1211
01:15:54,602 --> 01:15:57,435
We are getting information
that since the past ten years..

1212
01:15:59,366 --> 01:15:59,878
Yes, sir?

1213
01:15:59,958 --> 01:16:03,019
Set up check posts at all
the roads leading out of Mumbai.

1214
01:16:03,310 --> 01:16:05,647
Ajay Mehra shouldn't leave Mumbai.

1215
01:16:05,727 --> 01:16:07,439
Sir! Sir!
- He won't. don't worry, sir.

1216
01:16:07,519 --> 01:16:08,394
What would you like to say?

1217
01:16:08,477 --> 01:16:10,685
What did you find
inside Satyakam's office?

1218
01:16:10,769 --> 01:16:11,727
I am Satyakam.

1219
01:16:11,810 --> 01:16:13,730
Ajay Mehra has asked us to keep quiet.

1220
01:16:13,810 --> 01:16:16,727
What are the court orders?

1221
01:16:19,019 --> 01:16:20,435
As you can see..

1222
01:16:20,519 --> 01:16:22,269
We have also heard that..

1223
01:16:22,352 --> 01:16:24,352
..Ajay Mehra also makes
juvenile college students...

1224
01:16:24,432 --> 01:16:27,814
...hack email and bank
accounts of famous people.

1225
01:16:27,894 --> 01:16:31,022
For not, there's been a look
out notice issued against 4 students.

1226
01:16:31,102 --> 01:16:33,394
What is she saying about our kids?

1227
01:16:33,477 --> 01:16:35,977
Yes, I, too, heard it.
Please talk softly.

1228
01:16:36,060 --> 01:16:37,605
Why should we talk softly?

1229
01:16:37,685 --> 01:16:40,935
Everything is happening
because of your son, Rohan.

1230
01:16:41,019 --> 01:16:43,189
Why are you blaming Rohan?
- He loves to mess around with everyone.

1231
01:16:43,269 --> 01:16:46,314
I kept saying that you shouldn't
get Ajay Mehra involved.

1232
01:16:46,394 --> 01:16:48,019
But this was Anushka's project,
wasn't it?

1233
01:16:48,102 --> 01:16:51,769
Yes, it is.
But Zoya is responsible for this mess.

1234
01:16:51,852 --> 01:16:53,769
What? - She keeps coming
up with weird ideas.

1235
01:16:53,852 --> 01:16:55,519
Why are you involving
my daughter into this?

1236
01:16:55,602 --> 01:16:58,602
If you had given even a little
attention to your daughter..

1237
01:16:58,727 --> 01:17:00,685
Have you ever
read your daughter's blogs?

1238
01:17:00,810 --> 01:17:02,480
Zoya writes blogs?
- Yes.

1239
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:06,022
Why is the media saying such things
about our kids.. - So what do I do?

1240
01:17:06,102 --> 01:17:07,269
Who is it?
- Kriplani.

1241
01:17:07,352 --> 01:17:09,269
What is he saying? - He's saying that
the media is calling our kids criminals.

1242
01:17:09,352 --> 01:17:10,685
Search everyone's houses.

1243
01:17:10,769 --> 01:17:12,810
I mean everyone.

1244
01:17:12,894 --> 01:17:15,023
We got him, sir.
We are nearly there.

1245
01:17:32,019 --> 01:17:33,423
Shit!

1246
01:17:39,575 --> 01:17:40,591
What happened, sir?

1247
01:17:40,671 --> 01:17:43,575
Bansal's cyber cell was
trying to hack our server.

1248
01:17:43,759 --> 01:17:46,199
If it had succeeded, they would've
found out about this hideout.

1249
01:17:46,279 --> 01:17:47,185
But now we are safe.

1250
01:17:47,269 --> 01:17:47,980
Sir..

1251
01:17:48,060 --> 01:17:49,435
Troy wants to talk to you, sir.

1252
01:17:49,977 --> 01:17:50,591
Yeah, Troy.

1253
01:17:50,671 --> 01:17:52,807
Sir, I have tried
my best to break them.

1254
01:17:52,887 --> 01:17:54,227
But they are not talking.

1255
01:17:57,754 --> 01:17:59,082
Troy, just kill one of them.

1256
01:17:59,162 --> 01:18:01,211
Others will speak automatically.
- No, Troy.

1257
01:18:04,714 --> 01:18:06,762
Is this the best solution
you could think of?

1258
01:18:06,842 --> 01:18:08,211
That's the Nazi way, dad.

1259
01:18:08,294 --> 01:18:09,586
Fear of death is worse than death.

1260
01:18:09,669 --> 01:18:10,544
And next what?

1261
01:18:10,919 --> 01:18:12,442
Blow up this whole city with a bomb?

1262
01:18:12,986 --> 01:18:15,128
What do you think,
am I some god or godfather?

1263
01:18:15,211 --> 01:18:17,003
Are we running
a crime syndicate here?

1264
01:18:17,378 --> 01:18:19,034
Why are you shouting at me?

1265
01:18:19,306 --> 01:18:20,794
You are behaving as if
you haven't killed anybody.

1266
01:18:20,878 --> 01:18:21,984
What did you say?
- Raj..

1267
01:18:22,117 --> 01:18:23,730
What did you say?
- Yes, you heard me right.

1268
01:18:23,810 --> 01:18:25,544
You are behaving as if
you haven't killed anybody.

1269
01:18:25,628 --> 01:18:27,131
I didn't kill anyone with my own hands.
- What difference does it make?

1270
01:18:27,211 --> 01:18:29,128
It makes a difference because
we are running a business here.

1271
01:18:29,211 --> 01:18:31,173
We are not running a crime syndicate.
- Just keep quiet, Kabir.

1272
01:18:31,253 --> 01:18:33,253
I had got people killed
for tactical reasons.

1273
01:18:33,336 --> 01:18:35,338
You are a Harvard graduate.
- So what?

1274
01:18:35,418 --> 01:18:39,378
Don't you understand that
not rage but courage solves problems?

1275
01:18:39,461 --> 01:18:41,131
Go and think over this issue.
- Yes, I am going.

1276
01:18:41,211 --> 01:18:42,003
Go.
- I am going in my room.

1277
01:18:42,086 --> 01:18:43,034
Let me talk.

1278
01:18:43,114 --> 01:18:44,250
Kabir!

1279
01:18:46,474 --> 01:18:46,818
Hello?

1280
01:18:46,898 --> 01:18:49,919
Papa, food has been served.
We are waiting for you.

1281
01:18:50,626 --> 01:18:52,628
Give the phone to your grandma, dear.

1282
01:18:55,338 --> 01:18:55,711
Yes?

1283
01:18:55,794 --> 01:18:57,798
We got it, sir.
Here is the hard drive, sir.

1284
01:18:57,878 --> 01:18:59,298
See this.

1285
01:18:59,378 --> 01:19:03,203
Sir, I was scanning the mall's
footage and here's what I found.

1286
01:19:08,039 --> 01:19:09,529
Good. Very good.

1287
01:19:09,609 --> 01:19:11,003
Oh, we have got the drive!

1288
01:19:11,086 --> 01:19:12,503
My God. Inform Troy.

1289
01:19:12,586 --> 01:19:14,559
Troy is already in the mall, sir.
- Great.

1290
01:19:14,639 --> 01:19:16,336
Give me the live feed
of the shop. Give me. - Yes, sir.

1291
01:19:16,419 --> 01:19:19,211
Ask Troy to reach there quickly.
I want the hard drive now!

1292
01:19:20,847 --> 01:19:22,298
Your papa will come later.

1293
01:19:22,378 --> 01:19:23,753
We should start eating.

1294
01:19:23,836 --> 01:19:24,878
Prema?

1295
01:19:29,975 --> 01:19:31,253
This is the live feed from the mall.

1296
01:19:32,034 --> 01:19:36,015
Mr. Bansal, even Ajay Mehra
must be aware about this, right?

1297
01:19:39,042 --> 01:19:42,015
Doomed. He is already there.

1298
01:19:42,095 --> 01:19:43,343
Troy!

1299
01:19:43,423 --> 01:19:44,711
Where are you, Troy?

1300
01:19:56,071 --> 01:19:57,079
Good.

1301
01:19:58,058 --> 01:19:58,951
Catch him.

1302
01:20:42,721 --> 01:20:43,533
Troy!

1303
01:20:43,613 --> 01:20:45,627
Hard disk should not
go into Ajay Mehra's hand..

1304
01:20:45,707 --> 01:20:47,248
..even if you have to shoot him.

1305
01:20:47,328 --> 01:20:48,420
Kill him.

1306
01:21:15,889 --> 01:21:17,427
Doomed.

1307
01:21:27,084 --> 01:21:28,415
Go!

1308
01:21:54,131 --> 01:21:55,386
Watch out!

1309
01:21:56,632 --> 01:21:58,316
Do you have a death wish?

1310
01:22:11,414 --> 01:22:12,970
Hey, are you mad?

1311
01:22:14,198 --> 01:22:15,573
Have you gone crazy?

1312
01:22:17,656 --> 01:22:19,614
Watch out!
- Are you blind?

1313
01:22:54,959 --> 01:22:56,864
Oh, my God! He's got a gun!

1314
01:23:22,844 --> 01:23:24,181
Move!

1315
01:25:49,405 --> 01:25:50,798
Ajay Mehra.

1316
01:25:51,841 --> 01:25:52,943
That's Ajay Mehra.

1317
01:25:53,023 --> 01:25:55,633
Yes, he's wounded.

1318
01:26:15,445 --> 01:26:16,754
Move.

1319
01:28:35,813 --> 01:28:37,122
Yes Rakesh.
- Yes, sir.

1320
01:28:37,202 --> 01:28:37,915
What happened?

1321
01:28:38,201 --> 01:28:39,925
The news is true, sir.

1322
01:28:40,235 --> 01:28:44,444
We just found Raj Bansal's security
chief's dead body on the railway tracks.

1323
01:28:44,527 --> 01:28:47,444
People have also seen
Ajay Mehra fighting with him.

1324
01:28:47,655 --> 01:28:52,322
This means this issue directly
involves Ajay Mehra and Raj Bansal.

1325
01:28:52,402 --> 01:28:54,072
This is a very big story.

1326
01:28:54,152 --> 01:28:54,985
No, hang on.

1327
01:28:55,194 --> 01:28:56,197
Wait for my instructions.

1328
01:28:56,277 --> 01:28:57,777
Don't worry. The hospital..
- Sir..

1329
01:28:58,332 --> 01:28:59,652
Who..
- Mr. Kaitan.

1330
01:29:00,944 --> 01:29:01,468
Yes, Kaitan?

1331
01:29:01,548 --> 01:29:03,739
Mr. Bansal, we have been
hearing many rumors since morning..

1332
01:29:03,819 --> 01:29:06,996
..that you and your men are
involved in Ajay Mehra's case today.

1333
01:29:07,076 --> 01:29:07,860
So?

1334
01:29:07,944 --> 01:29:10,985
Nothing. We are not
airing any news against you.

1335
01:29:11,069 --> 01:29:11,735
Don't worry.

1336
01:29:11,819 --> 01:29:14,819
We understand that Ajay Mehra
has become a problem for all of us.

1337
01:29:14,902 --> 01:29:16,235
Good.
- We don't..

1338
01:29:18,027 --> 01:29:21,027
Rakesh, for now we
will only show the truth..

1339
01:29:21,110 --> 01:29:23,322
..that doesn't affect our
channel's business interest. - Okay.

1340
01:29:23,402 --> 01:29:26,319
Keep an eye on the situation
and keep me updated.

1341
01:29:26,402 --> 01:29:27,069
Got it?

1342
01:29:27,152 --> 01:29:27,777
Okay, sir.

1343
01:29:32,610 --> 01:29:33,610
Akshay!

1344
01:29:33,966 --> 01:29:34,902
Yes, sir.

1345
01:29:35,196 --> 01:29:37,485
Sir, this.. - Akshay..
Where are the kids and Riya?

1346
01:29:37,565 --> 01:29:39,735
Sir, the kids were in a bad condition
so Riya took them to the hospital.

1347
01:29:39,819 --> 01:29:41,735
But she is on her way back.
- What happened over here?

1348
01:29:42,194 --> 01:29:43,152
All this..

1349
01:29:43,235 --> 01:29:44,819
Sir, Bansal was trying
to track our location..

1350
01:29:44,964 --> 01:29:46,252
..so I had to disconnect everything.

1351
01:29:46,332 --> 01:29:48,652
Here. Connect this.
- We had no other option.

1352
01:30:10,692 --> 01:30:11,902
Ajay.

1353
01:30:12,429 --> 01:30:13,694
Riya.

1354
01:30:14,469 --> 01:30:15,777
What happened?

1355
01:30:17,337 --> 01:30:18,360
What happened?

1356
01:30:20,129 --> 01:30:22,235
We had taken the kids
to the hospital.

1357
01:30:23,902 --> 01:30:25,864
Let me go! - Help me!
- How could you just barge in?

1358
01:30:25,944 --> 01:30:28,485
Security! Security! Stop them!

1359
01:30:28,569 --> 01:30:29,947
Help me!

1360
01:30:30,027 --> 01:30:31,737
Security!
- Leave me.

1361
01:30:33,665 --> 01:30:36,072
Leave me! Let go! Let me go!

1362
01:30:36,152 --> 01:30:38,485
Anushka!
- Leave me!

1363
01:30:38,753 --> 01:30:40,572
Somebody help us!

1364
01:30:40,652 --> 01:30:42,777
Let them go!

1365
01:30:42,857 --> 01:30:44,735
Let them go!

1366
01:30:45,101 --> 01:30:47,694
Anushka! Rohan!

1367
01:30:48,001 --> 01:30:50,322
Anushka!
- Rohan!

1368
01:30:50,402 --> 01:30:52,985
Why are you hitting them?
Leave them.

1369
01:30:55,439 --> 01:30:56,735
Rohan!

1370
01:30:56,815 --> 01:30:57,777
Ma'am!

1371
01:30:57,857 --> 01:30:59,819
Ma'am, please help us!
Ma'am! - Let them go!

1372
01:30:59,902 --> 01:31:03,072
Let them go! Leave me!
- Yes, sir.

1373
01:31:03,152 --> 01:31:04,819
Let me go!
- Talk to him.

1374
01:31:04,902 --> 01:31:05,633
Talk to him.

1375
01:31:05,713 --> 01:31:07,860
I could've killed you as well, doctor.

1376
01:31:08,521 --> 01:31:13,444
But I am letting you live.
- Bansal, they are just kids!

1377
01:31:13,524 --> 01:31:15,194
What enmity do you have with them!

1378
01:31:15,277 --> 01:31:17,985
Let them go! - Go and reason
it with your mental patient.

1379
01:31:18,065 --> 01:31:20,129
If he doesn't return the video..

1380
01:31:20,209 --> 01:31:23,152
..then I'll hang their dead bodies
of them at Ajay Mehra's press.

1381
01:31:23,232 --> 01:31:24,944
Do you understand that?

1382
01:31:25,077 --> 01:31:26,902
I couldn't do anything.

1383
01:31:27,194 --> 01:31:30,444
I couldn't do anything. Ajay..

1384
01:31:36,617 --> 01:31:44,860
Satyakam, our years of hard work,
our sacrifices..

1385
01:31:45,557 --> 01:31:51,266
In just a few hours that man
has brought us back to square one.

1386
01:31:52,307 --> 01:31:55,016
The entire systems and machineries..

1387
01:31:55,266 --> 01:31:57,724
..have become a criminal's agent.

1388
01:31:58,724 --> 01:32:03,182
And people are still just
watching from the sidelines.

1389
01:32:03,729 --> 01:32:06,391
They will side the one who wins.

1390
01:32:07,016 --> 01:32:09,557
They don't give a damn
about the truth or lies.

1391
01:32:14,057 --> 01:32:17,224
Okay, then so be it.

1392
01:32:19,557 --> 01:32:22,061
Akshay, upload it.

1393
01:32:22,141 --> 01:32:23,811
I cannot, sir. The server is dead.

1394
01:32:23,891 --> 01:32:26,349
Fine then make copies of it.

1395
01:32:26,429 --> 01:32:29,099
Yes. I will personally distribute
it across the city.

1396
01:32:29,182 --> 01:32:30,584
Make copies of it.
- Didn't you hear me?

1397
01:32:30,664 --> 01:32:32,099
Make the copies.
- They will kill the kids.

1398
01:32:32,179 --> 01:32:35,474
Let him kills the kids if he wants to!

1399
01:32:35,974 --> 01:32:38,474
He is already on a killing spree.

1400
01:32:38,557 --> 01:32:40,974
He killed Joe D'Souza.

1401
01:32:41,141 --> 01:32:43,519
He killed so many
innocent people as well.

1402
01:32:43,599 --> 01:32:47,807
And today,
he killed our friends in front of you.

1403
01:32:48,349 --> 01:32:49,349
No!

1404
01:32:50,474 --> 01:32:53,849
I will destroy Bansal's empire..

1405
01:32:53,932 --> 01:32:55,977
I will have him begging on streets!

1406
01:32:56,057 --> 01:32:58,349
I will expose him!

1407
01:32:58,599 --> 01:33:00,391
What are you waiting for?
Make copies of it.

1408
01:33:00,471 --> 01:33:02,057
Make copies of it.
- Stop it.

1409
01:33:02,141 --> 01:33:03,974
Make copies of it. No!
- What are you doing? Stop it.

1410
01:33:04,057 --> 01:33:05,099
I want copies.

1411
01:33:05,182 --> 01:33:06,519
Make copies of it.
- Stop it.

1412
01:33:06,599 --> 01:33:07,602
Copies. Copies
- Stop it.

1413
01:33:07,682 --> 01:33:08,557
I want copies.
- Stop it.

1414
01:33:08,641 --> 01:33:10,099
Come to your senses!
Stop it! Stop it!

1415
01:33:10,182 --> 01:33:11,766
Look at me.
They are kids.

1416
01:33:12,307 --> 01:33:15,391
They are just kids.
They are innocent, Ajay.

1417
01:33:15,474 --> 01:33:18,932
They don't know that this
video could have them killed.

1418
01:33:19,349 --> 01:33:21,057
What do you want?

1419
01:33:21,805 --> 01:33:24,516
You want their photos
on that martyrs' board?

1420
01:33:25,057 --> 01:33:27,266
Can you live with that?
Can you?

1421
01:33:27,474 --> 01:33:34,141
You didn't see how
they killed Joe D'Souza.

1422
01:33:35,391 --> 01:33:38,857
Just look at that.
- I know.

1423
01:33:39,724 --> 01:33:41,724
I know, Ajay. I know.

1424
01:33:42,391 --> 01:33:46,849
But even Joe sir wouldn't
want us to risk the lives of kids.

1425
01:33:47,224 --> 01:33:52,599
And we have no right
to take such a risk with them.

1426
01:33:52,849 --> 01:33:55,849
Please Ajay.. try to understand.

1427
01:33:56,705 --> 01:33:58,516
They are not our kids.

1428
01:34:38,481 --> 01:34:42,856
You thought that you would
come on news channels, as heroes.

1429
01:34:43,148 --> 01:34:44,023
Right?

1430
01:34:53,415 --> 01:34:56,999
For Ajay Satyakam Mehra,
these four kids were blackmailing..

1431
01:34:57,082 --> 01:35:00,044
..money laundering
and hacking accounts.

1432
01:35:00,124 --> 01:35:03,044
The police are yet
to disclose their names.

1433
01:35:03,124 --> 01:35:07,874
But they say that these kids
will soon be in their custody.

1434
01:35:10,912 --> 01:35:12,499
Luckily, all of you are just kids.

1435
01:35:14,040 --> 01:35:15,207
Not you, Rohan.

1436
01:35:15,488 --> 01:35:19,749
You know what treatment
boys like you get in the jail.

1437
01:35:20,467 --> 01:35:21,832
Don't drop the soap..

1438
01:35:21,915 --> 01:35:23,332
No, Rohan.

1439
01:35:28,126 --> 01:35:30,040
She has you whipped, already.

1440
01:35:37,621 --> 01:35:39,124
Kabir!

1441
01:35:39,874 --> 01:35:41,698
Anushka!
- I will kill you!

1442
01:35:44,884 --> 01:35:46,419
Stop, please! No.

1443
01:35:46,499 --> 01:35:47,707
Leave him!

1444
01:35:50,163 --> 01:35:52,165
No!
- Leave him!

1445
01:35:52,249 --> 01:35:54,457
Kabir!
- Leave him!

1446
01:35:54,723 --> 01:35:56,749
No!
- Kabir!

1447
01:36:07,964 --> 01:36:09,165
What?

1448
01:36:09,746 --> 01:36:11,188
What were you doing in there?

1449
01:36:11,268 --> 01:36:13,059
Teaching these slaves a lesson.

1450
01:36:14,601 --> 01:36:15,559
Kabir!

1451
01:36:18,018 --> 01:36:19,518
Have you lost your mind?

1452
01:36:20,778 --> 01:36:22,354
Kabir.. listen to me.

1453
01:36:22,434 --> 01:36:23,351
Stop.

1454
01:36:23,431 --> 01:36:24,268
Stop, Kabir!

1455
01:36:24,434 --> 01:36:25,393
Listen to me.

1456
01:36:25,476 --> 01:36:26,809
Listen to me, Kabir!

1457
01:36:27,605 --> 01:36:28,976
Listen to me.

1458
01:36:29,369 --> 01:36:30,934
Kabir.. listen to me.

1459
01:36:54,857 --> 01:36:55,976
Son..

1460
01:36:57,643 --> 01:37:02,532
One should hide their children's
mistakes, not their crimes..

1461
01:37:08,649 --> 01:37:11,393
I heard someone scream.

1462
01:37:11,809 --> 01:37:13,268
What is happening?

1463
01:37:14,559 --> 01:37:15,726
It's nothing, mother.

1464
01:37:15,809 --> 01:37:16,726
Go to your room.

1465
01:37:16,809 --> 01:37:18,729
I am not blind or deaf, son.

1466
01:37:18,809 --> 01:37:20,643
It's nothing, mother. Come.

1467
01:37:20,726 --> 01:37:23,601
I feel as if something very bad
is going to happen. - Come with me.

1468
01:37:23,768 --> 01:37:25,518
Why are you hiding it from me?
- Come.

1469
01:37:25,715 --> 01:37:27,476
I am feeling very scared.
- Mother..

1470
01:37:27,556 --> 01:37:28,896
I am not feeling good..

1471
01:37:28,976 --> 01:37:32,809
Sir.. - Mother,
you should take care of Ananya.

1472
01:37:33,143 --> 01:37:35,184
Please take care of Ananya.
- I am feeling very scared.

1473
01:37:35,264 --> 01:37:36,197
Please, mother.

1474
01:37:36,277 --> 01:37:38,351
I am not feeling good about this.

1475
01:37:38,431 --> 01:37:40,521
Yes, tell me.
- Very good news, sir.

1476
01:37:40,601 --> 01:37:42,601
Ajay Mehra is going
to Kriplani's house.

1477
01:37:42,681 --> 01:37:43,896
Kriplani had called.

1478
01:37:43,976 --> 01:37:47,143
He said that Dr. Riya is coming
over to his house with Ajay Mehra.

1479
01:37:48,811 --> 01:37:49,684
Good.

1480
01:37:50,434 --> 01:37:50,976
Good.

1481
01:37:51,059 --> 01:37:53,684
We have our men there.
If you want we could.. - No!

1482
01:38:06,986 --> 01:38:07,896
No!

1483
01:38:07,976 --> 01:38:09,226
My leg!

1484
01:38:09,434 --> 01:38:11,010
My leg!

1485
01:38:26,851 --> 01:38:29,729
Grandma.. let's pray.

1486
01:38:29,809 --> 01:38:31,934
Everything will be fine.

1487
01:38:32,976 --> 01:38:35,268
Everything will be fine, my child.

1488
01:38:40,809 --> 01:38:42,104
Where is my daughter?
- Ajay!

1489
01:38:42,184 --> 01:38:43,601
Where is my daughter?
- Did you find the kids?

1490
01:38:43,684 --> 01:38:46,476
Ajay, give us that evidence video..
- Ajay, how dare you..?

1491
01:38:46,559 --> 01:38:49,434
Ajay, who has given you the right
to put my daughter's life at risk!

1492
01:38:49,518 --> 01:38:50,521
Give that damn thing now!

1493
01:38:50,601 --> 01:38:52,521
We too are concerned
about your children's safety.

1494
01:38:52,601 --> 01:38:55,434
Why would you be concerned? - If you are
concerned then give us the evidence.

1495
01:38:55,518 --> 01:38:57,976
This is not done.
- Let me at least talk.

1496
01:38:58,226 --> 01:39:00,559
My Varun..
- Please listen to me. Hold on. Please listen to me.

1497
01:39:00,643 --> 01:39:02,976
Just listen to me. Listen to me!

1498
01:39:04,246 --> 01:39:08,121
Once Bansal is exposed,
he will be busy saving himself.

1499
01:39:08,204 --> 01:39:09,791
You.. - He won't
do anything to the kids.

1500
01:39:09,871 --> 01:39:11,204
You just need to be patient.

1501
01:39:11,287 --> 01:39:13,287
He has our kids!
- You don't understand.

1502
01:39:13,371 --> 01:39:14,457
If anything happens to Rohan...

1503
01:39:14,537 --> 01:39:17,496
He won't do anything to them!
- How can you say that?

1504
01:39:17,579 --> 01:39:20,249
Once he is exposed, he can do nothing!
- I am worried about my kid.

1505
01:39:20,329 --> 01:39:22,537
He cannot do anything...
- Ajay Mehra.

1506
01:39:23,033 --> 01:39:26,496
You?
- Give them the evidence..

1507
01:39:26,746 --> 01:39:29,121
Or your daughter will die.

1508
01:39:30,283 --> 01:39:32,121
Daughter?
- Yes.

1509
01:39:33,329 --> 01:39:35,957
Anushka is your daughter.
- My daughter?!

1510
01:39:36,037 --> 01:39:37,704
But you said.

1511
01:39:37,996 --> 01:39:41,454
Varsha is dead.

1512
01:39:41,996 --> 01:39:44,874
And her child is also dead.

1513
01:39:44,954 --> 01:39:46,662
Because of you.

1514
01:39:46,996 --> 01:39:49,496
During delivery..
- No. You are lying!

1515
01:39:49,576 --> 01:39:52,041
Both of them..
- I spoke to her a few days ago.

1516
01:39:52,121 --> 01:39:53,996
They are dead because of you.

1517
01:39:54,287 --> 01:39:56,746
Both of them are dead because of you.

1518
01:39:56,829 --> 01:39:58,454
It's your fault.
- No!

1519
01:39:58,787 --> 01:40:00,829
I want to die. I want to die.

1520
01:40:01,204 --> 01:40:03,621
Let me die.

1521
01:40:04,996 --> 01:40:07,162
Ajay, drink this water.

1522
01:40:07,539 --> 01:40:08,954
I want to go to Varsha.

1523
01:40:34,888 --> 01:40:36,871
My daughter is alive.

1524
01:40:38,119 --> 01:40:39,954
You kept her hidden?

1525
01:40:40,926 --> 01:40:42,079
Why?

1526
01:40:43,749 --> 01:40:45,371
Why did you keep my daughter hidden?

1527
01:40:45,454 --> 01:40:48,663
Because I wanted to keep her alive.

1528
01:40:49,833 --> 01:40:52,996
Anyone who was close to you died.

1529
01:40:53,829 --> 01:40:54,996
Your brother.

1530
01:40:55,831 --> 01:40:56,954
Your sister-in-law.

1531
01:40:57,829 --> 01:40:59,412
Your friends.

1532
01:40:59,787 --> 01:41:00,746
Varsha.

1533
01:41:00,954 --> 01:41:02,121
D'Souza.

1534
01:41:02,204 --> 01:41:04,787
All of them.
All of them died.

1535
01:41:05,088 --> 01:41:09,829
Now look, your daughter facing death..

1536
01:41:11,246 --> 01:41:14,329
..as soon as she came close to you.

1537
01:41:14,871 --> 01:41:18,204
Why do you want to kill your daughter?

1538
01:41:18,454 --> 01:41:20,079
You want Anushka dead.

1539
01:41:20,162 --> 01:41:22,371
Enough, uncle,
you have said enough.

1540
01:41:22,454 --> 01:41:23,829
Calm down.
- Varun!

1541
01:41:24,537 --> 01:41:26,204
My son!

1542
01:41:26,621 --> 01:41:28,121
Mother!

1543
01:41:28,287 --> 01:41:29,366
My son!

1544
01:41:29,446 --> 01:41:30,412
Son..

1545
01:41:31,871 --> 01:41:33,037
How did this...

1546
01:41:33,121 --> 01:41:35,287
It's hurting a lot, mother.
- Where?

1547
01:41:35,371 --> 01:41:37,704
It's hurting a lot.
- Where does it hurt, son?

1548
01:41:37,829 --> 01:41:40,162
Oh God, they have hurt him so badly.

1549
01:41:40,371 --> 01:41:42,162
It's hurting. Move aside.

1550
01:41:42,246 --> 01:41:43,412
Please to listen to me.
- Ajay sir..

1551
01:41:43,496 --> 01:41:45,454
Listen to me, Varun. Listen to me.

1552
01:41:45,704 --> 01:41:48,204
Sir, they will kill my friends.

1553
01:41:48,287 --> 01:41:50,371
Sir, they are ruthless.

1554
01:41:50,572 --> 01:41:52,454
Sir, we can't take it anymore.

1555
01:41:52,851 --> 01:41:56,162
Please, sir. - Give them the evidence.
- Now what else do you want, Ajay?

1556
01:41:56,246 --> 01:41:57,412
Please give it.
- Give them the hard drive.

1557
01:41:57,496 --> 01:41:58,996
We can't take it anymore.

1558
01:41:59,204 --> 01:42:00,803
Sir, please give the hard drive.

1559
01:42:01,865 --> 01:42:02,963
Please sir.

1560
01:42:03,043 --> 01:42:05,215
Take this.
- Thank you.

1561
01:42:05,295 --> 01:42:06,349
Thank you, sir.

1562
01:42:06,429 --> 01:42:07,433
Move aside.

1563
01:42:07,516 --> 01:42:08,603
Move aside.

1564
01:42:08,683 --> 01:42:11,144
But you got the hard drive.
- I have to save my friends.

1565
01:42:11,224 --> 01:42:13,811
Varun, stop. Varun..

1566
01:42:13,891 --> 01:42:16,599
Please go along with my son.

1567
01:43:11,433 --> 01:43:12,891
Zoya!
- Varun!

1568
01:43:12,971 --> 01:43:13,641
Zoya!

1569
01:43:13,724 --> 01:43:15,516
Rohan!
- Mom!

1570
01:43:15,596 --> 01:43:18,261
How are you?
- My child..

1571
01:43:21,236 --> 01:43:22,361
What happened?

1572
01:43:22,444 --> 01:43:23,277
I am so happy.

1573
01:43:23,361 --> 01:43:26,027
You are back. I don't want anything else.
- Ajay sir.. sir..

1574
01:43:28,069 --> 01:43:29,527
Anushka..

1575
01:43:31,713 --> 01:43:33,194
She is still there.

1576
01:43:34,247 --> 01:43:36,486
Sir, they were first
going to keep me back.

1577
01:43:36,569 --> 01:43:41,611
But as soon as they learnt that she is
your daughter, they kept her instead.

1578
01:43:43,819 --> 01:43:47,819
Sir, they know everything
that is happening here.

1579
01:43:48,319 --> 01:43:49,986
Because of my dad.

1580
01:43:54,443 --> 01:43:55,527
I am sorry.

1581
01:43:55,611 --> 01:43:59,611
Sir, Bansal has given this for you.

1582
01:44:16,569 --> 01:44:18,777
Are you my father?

1583
01:44:21,444 --> 01:44:22,694
Yes, dear.

1584
01:44:23,902 --> 01:44:26,611
Then where have you
been all these years?

1585
01:44:29,399 --> 01:44:31,986
Why was I kept away from you?

1586
01:44:38,294 --> 01:44:41,876
Why did grandpa always
say that my parents are no more?

1587
01:44:42,501 --> 01:44:45,459
I am sorry, dear.

1588
01:44:46,307 --> 01:44:47,292
I am sorry.

1589
01:44:47,876 --> 01:44:51,376
You didn't know that
you had a daughter?

1590
01:44:52,917 --> 01:44:55,667
You didn't know about me?

1591
01:44:56,671 --> 01:45:00,126
I will explain everything
when we will meet.

1592
01:45:01,709 --> 01:45:03,751
You are not my father.

1593
01:45:03,834 --> 01:45:07,001
No, dear. I am your papa.

1594
01:45:07,626 --> 01:45:09,004
I will explain everything.

1595
01:45:09,084 --> 01:45:11,501
What will you explain?

1596
01:45:12,396 --> 01:45:14,792
When I was small,
and I used to go to school..

1597
01:45:14,876 --> 01:45:18,751
..I used to think that all
my friends have parents, but I don't.

1598
01:45:20,376 --> 01:45:24,001
Since childhood I have been
told that I don't have anyone.

1599
01:45:27,116 --> 01:45:28,406
I am sorry, dear.

1600
01:45:28,486 --> 01:45:30,084
I did not have anyone, papa.

1601
01:45:31,352 --> 01:45:31,996
My child..

1602
01:45:32,076 --> 01:45:34,126
I thought that I am alone.

1603
01:45:35,889 --> 01:45:36,839
My child..

1604
01:45:36,919 --> 01:45:39,626
What will you explain,
that why am I here?

1605
01:45:40,278 --> 01:45:42,754
Why they are troubling me?

1606
01:45:42,834 --> 01:45:45,084
Why am I facing these problems?

1607
01:45:45,417 --> 01:45:47,417
What will you explain?
- Dear..

1608
01:45:47,792 --> 01:45:50,128
You are not my father.

1609
01:45:50,208 --> 01:45:51,692
No dear, you shouldn't say that.

1610
01:45:51,772 --> 01:45:53,667
I hate you!

1611
01:45:54,227 --> 01:45:55,042
Dear..

1612
01:45:55,451 --> 01:45:56,424
Anushka!

1613
01:45:56,797 --> 01:45:57,459
My child..

1614
01:45:57,542 --> 01:46:00,449
Don't worry. I will explain
everything to your daughter.

1615
01:46:00,835 --> 01:46:04,930
Bansal, I gave you the hard drive.

1616
01:46:05,488 --> 01:46:08,263
Give me my daughter back.

1617
01:46:08,343 --> 01:46:10,975
You are a smart journalist, Ajay.
- Please send her back.

1618
01:46:11,055 --> 01:46:13,596
I am sure you must have
made copies of this video.

1619
01:46:13,676 --> 01:46:16,346
I don't have any copies, Bansal.
I don't.

1620
01:46:16,430 --> 01:46:18,425
This is what was told
to me last time as well.

1621
01:46:18,505 --> 01:46:20,555
But then copies of
that video cropped up.

1622
01:46:20,638 --> 01:46:22,596
Hence, this time
I cannot take any risk.

1623
01:46:22,680 --> 01:46:26,388
Your daughter is the
guarantee of my son's safety.

1624
01:46:26,632 --> 01:46:28,680
Anyway, what difference
does it make to you?

1625
01:46:29,202 --> 01:46:30,805
She has been staying
away from you all this while.

1626
01:46:30,885 --> 01:46:33,055
Stop your nonsense, Bansal.

1627
01:46:33,575 --> 01:46:35,680
Give me my daughter back.

1628
01:46:35,763 --> 01:46:36,471
No!

1629
01:46:36,555 --> 01:46:37,721
Give me my daughter back.

1630
01:46:37,805 --> 01:46:40,277
She will stay with
me till you are alive.

1631
01:46:40,357 --> 01:46:43,565
And remember,
if you do anything stupid..

1632
01:46:43,645 --> 01:46:44,680
Anything..

1633
01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:47,680
Then you know what you will lose.

1634
01:46:49,262 --> 01:46:51,220
And the discussion ends here.

1635
01:47:02,179 --> 01:47:03,345
Joshi..
- Yes, sir..

1636
01:47:09,143 --> 01:47:11,804
Joshi, take this
girl back to her father.

1637
01:47:11,887 --> 01:47:13,929
Mother!
- What are you..?

1638
01:47:14,637 --> 01:47:17,557
You will kidnap someone's daughter?

1639
01:47:17,637 --> 01:47:19,179
Now this is what you will do?

1640
01:47:19,262 --> 01:47:20,429
Then what do you want?

1641
01:47:20,637 --> 01:47:22,054
That I should shoot Kabir?

1642
01:47:22,134 --> 01:47:24,338
Should I send him to jail?
- Yes, send him to jail.

1643
01:47:24,418 --> 01:47:26,224
He has committed a crime.

1644
01:47:26,304 --> 01:47:27,807
He should be punished.

1645
01:47:27,887 --> 01:47:29,599
What are you saying?

1646
01:47:29,679 --> 01:47:33,929
The stock market will crash if
Kabir even gets a scratch on his body.

1647
01:47:34,163 --> 01:47:36,807
Thousands of investors
will commit suicide.

1648
01:47:36,887 --> 01:47:40,099
You want to kill thousands
to save a single girl?

1649
01:47:40,179 --> 01:47:42,099
You too have a daughter.

1650
01:47:42,179 --> 01:47:44,057
What if someone does this to her?

1651
01:47:44,137 --> 01:47:45,179
Mother!

1652
01:47:45,637 --> 01:47:49,422
If someone touches my daughter,
I will kill him!

1653
01:47:49,502 --> 01:47:51,140
I am Raj Bansal!

1654
01:47:51,220 --> 01:47:52,599
What do you think?

1655
01:47:52,679 --> 01:47:57,644
Your daughter is valuable
and his daughter is not?

1656
01:47:57,724 --> 01:48:01,785
Raj, anyone's daughter
is always treated like one's own.

1657
01:48:01,865 --> 01:48:04,679
Let me do my work, mother.
Please. Go away from here.

1658
01:48:04,762 --> 01:48:06,512
I won't leave.
- Please leave, mother.

1659
01:48:06,595 --> 01:48:09,057
I will send this
girl back to her father.

1660
01:48:09,137 --> 01:48:11,724
Let me do my work. Sheetal, take her away.
- What you are doing is not right.

1661
01:48:11,804 --> 01:48:14,054
You keep quiet.
You too are just like him.

1662
01:48:14,137 --> 01:48:15,512
Please leave, mother.
- No.

1663
01:48:15,595 --> 01:48:16,387
Take her away, Sheetal.
- Okay..

1664
01:48:16,470 --> 01:48:17,887
Please. - What you
are doing is not right.

1665
01:48:17,970 --> 01:48:18,887
Let's go, mother.
- Please, mother.

1666
01:48:18,970 --> 01:48:20,345
Something bad is
going to happen to us.

1667
01:48:20,429 --> 01:48:22,262
Please leave.
- You are not getting it, Raj.

1668
01:48:22,768 --> 01:48:24,970
Everything will be over.

1669
01:48:25,853 --> 01:48:27,640
What does he think of himself?
- Calm down, mother.

1670
01:48:27,720 --> 01:48:28,807
What does he think of himself?

1671
01:48:28,887 --> 01:48:30,554
A sin is being committed in my house.
- Come with me.

1672
01:48:30,637 --> 01:48:32,470
He has lost his mind.

1673
01:48:32,554 --> 01:48:34,262
Come on, sit down.
- This is wrong.

1674
01:48:34,345 --> 01:48:35,557
It is wrong.
- Sit down.

1675
01:48:35,637 --> 01:48:40,355
What happened, grandma? Why are
you crying? What happened, grandma?

1676
01:48:40,735 --> 01:48:42,902
It's nothing, dear.
It's nothing.

1677
01:48:45,196 --> 01:48:46,073
Joshi..
- Yes, sir.

1678
01:48:46,153 --> 01:48:48,617
Call the chopper. Take her
to our sea oilrig. - Right sir.

1679
01:48:48,697 --> 01:48:50,496
Kaka Sahib,
get Ajay Mehra arrested.

1680
01:48:50,576 --> 01:48:52,680
We are done with him now.
- Hello Chetan..

1681
01:48:52,760 --> 01:48:55,925
Get air clearance right away
and get the chopper to Bansal Mansion.

1682
01:48:59,586 --> 01:49:00,970
If I go...

1683
01:49:03,426 --> 01:49:06,218
They will kill her.

1684
01:49:09,424 --> 01:49:11,218
If I don't go..

1685
01:49:11,831 --> 01:49:15,343
He will send my daughter
somewhere far away..

1686
01:49:17,231 --> 01:49:21,647
And I want my daughter.
What do I do?

1687
01:49:22,813 --> 01:49:24,022
Ajay..

1688
01:49:24,814 --> 01:49:26,439
Go get your daughter.

1689
01:49:58,981 --> 01:50:00,689
How could he just run away?

1690
01:50:00,772 --> 01:50:02,022
What were you doing?

1691
01:50:02,106 --> 01:50:03,814
Why didn't you just shoot him?

1692
01:50:05,091 --> 01:50:09,772
Ajay Mehra escaped in a police van.

1693
01:50:10,224 --> 01:50:12,314
Your mother was right..

1694
01:50:12,610 --> 01:50:15,814
Why did you kidnap his daughter?

1695
01:50:16,530 --> 01:50:20,647
His brother was kidnapped and he had
caused havoc in the entire Mumbai city.

1696
01:50:20,727 --> 01:50:23,810
You have kidnapped his daughter.
His daughter!

1697
01:50:23,893 --> 01:50:25,435
He will tear down
the entire Mumbai city.

1698
01:50:25,518 --> 01:50:26,935
How can he tear down
the entire Mumbai city?

1699
01:50:27,018 --> 01:50:27,935
Now what do I tell you?

1700
01:50:28,018 --> 01:50:30,105
Set up check posts
all across the city.

1701
01:50:30,185 --> 01:50:32,850
Check posts..
- Issue shoot at sight orders.

1702
01:50:32,930 --> 01:50:35,602
If I see Ajay Mehra
anywhere near this mansion today..

1703
01:50:35,685 --> 01:50:37,185
Then your political career will end.

1704
01:50:37,268 --> 01:50:38,602
I worry more about my
life than my political career.

1705
01:50:38,685 --> 01:50:39,518
Joshi!
- Yes, sir!

1706
01:50:39,602 --> 01:50:40,897
Hello? - Take his
daughter to the helipad.

1707
01:50:40,977 --> 01:50:43,102
And ask Troy's team
and ground force to be ready.

1708
01:50:43,185 --> 01:50:43,852
Okay, sir.

1709
01:50:43,935 --> 01:50:46,150
Ajay Mehra wants to have war.

1710
01:50:46,230 --> 01:50:47,238
We will give him war!

1711
01:50:47,584 --> 01:50:50,024
'Ajay Mehra ran away in Bandra
Pali Hill Beats' police van..

1712
01:50:50,104 --> 01:50:51,738
..number MH-02-FA-7015.'

1713
01:50:51,818 --> 01:50:53,187
We just got the information that..

1714
01:50:53,271 --> 01:50:56,258
..Mumbai police has issued shoot
at sight orders against Ajay Mehra.

1715
01:50:56,338 --> 01:50:58,530
'Block all the roads
leading to Worli.'

1716
01:50:58,610 --> 01:51:00,666
We have been informed that Ajay
Mehra attacked the police team..

1717
01:51:00,746 --> 01:51:01,994
..and ran away in a police jeep.

1718
01:51:02,074 --> 01:51:04,535
Block the roads going towards
the sea-link.

1719
01:51:04,615 --> 01:51:06,199
Search each and every car.

1720
01:51:07,002 --> 01:51:09,657
These are the orders from above.

1721
01:51:09,737 --> 01:51:11,532
Put up tight police security.

1722
01:51:11,615 --> 01:51:12,657
Patil make sure.

1723
01:51:12,740 --> 01:51:15,740
Set up the barricades on sea-link
to Bansal mansion road.

1724
01:51:15,824 --> 01:51:17,115
Yes sir.
- Search each and every car.

1725
01:51:17,199 --> 01:51:19,282
Shoot Ajay Mehra
if he doesn't surrender.

1726
01:51:28,040 --> 01:51:30,074
Fast. Fast. Fast.

1727
01:51:31,735 --> 01:51:34,360
Hurry up. Be quick.

1728
01:51:41,318 --> 01:51:41,949
Hello.

1729
01:51:42,029 --> 01:51:44,615
Sir, after looking at the way police
are setting up barricades all around..

1730
01:51:44,699 --> 01:51:48,574
..the Bansal Mansion,
I feel something big about to happen.

1731
01:51:48,654 --> 01:51:51,070
Now we will have to
expose Bansal in this case.

1732
01:51:51,150 --> 01:51:52,102
Hang on
- Yes, sir.

1733
01:51:52,182 --> 01:51:53,740
I will let you know
what you need to do.

1734
01:51:54,603 --> 01:51:56,532
Move the barricades. Hurry up.

1735
01:51:56,612 --> 01:51:57,949
Jai Hind, sir.
- Yes, sir.

1736
01:51:58,032 --> 01:52:00,532
Sir you don't worry,
I am on the location itself.

1737
01:52:00,612 --> 01:52:03,865
Police has set up the barricades
around Bansal Mansion.

1738
01:52:03,949 --> 01:52:06,032
I have also arranged
the Special forces.

1739
01:52:06,115 --> 01:52:08,188
Do anything you have to do.
Just arrest Ajay Mehra!

1740
01:52:08,268 --> 01:52:09,824
I will do it, sir. I will do it.

1741
01:52:09,907 --> 01:52:12,675
This time he has directly
challenged Mumbai police.

1742
01:52:12,755 --> 01:52:15,824
Now if Ajay Mehra doesn't
surrender then he will die.

1743
01:52:23,809 --> 01:52:26,532
Don't let the media inside.
Move back.

1744
01:52:26,615 --> 01:52:29,115
Go. Hurry up.
- Hurry up.

1745
01:52:29,199 --> 01:52:30,490
Hello, control room.

1746
01:52:30,824 --> 01:52:33,452
Sir, we have found the
car Ajay Mehra ran away in.

1747
01:52:33,532 --> 01:52:35,199
Then why are you informing me,
you idiot?

1748
01:52:35,279 --> 01:52:37,013
Are we looking for
Ajay Mehra or the van?

1749
01:52:37,093 --> 01:52:39,199
Look for him in the area
where you found the jeep.

1750
01:52:39,279 --> 01:52:40,407
Find him.

1751
01:52:48,124 --> 01:52:49,624
Who stopped the traffic?

1752
01:52:49,708 --> 01:52:51,499
Clear the traffic.
- Come on.

1753
01:52:54,394 --> 01:52:58,291
Sir, Ajay Mehra has
hijacked our chopper.

1754
01:53:12,610 --> 01:53:14,762
Send Troy's team to the helipad.
- Okay, sir.

1755
01:53:18,626 --> 01:53:19,669
Are you mad, Ajay Mehra?

1756
01:53:19,749 --> 01:53:21,044
Have you lost your mind?

1757
01:53:21,124 --> 01:53:22,874
After stealing my
chopper you think you will..

1758
01:53:22,958 --> 01:53:26,294
..take your daughter
alive from my house?

1759
01:53:26,374 --> 01:53:29,253
I say, you should go back.
You still have time.

1760
01:53:29,333 --> 01:53:31,583
He will kill us.
- Shut up!

1761
01:53:33,499 --> 01:53:35,458
I am warning you.

1762
01:53:35,541 --> 01:53:38,333
I will bury your daughter alive.

1763
01:53:38,666 --> 01:53:42,208
Are you listening to me?
- Mr. Bansal, listen to me..

1764
01:53:42,291 --> 01:53:44,628
Shut up! Shut up!
- He is coming. I had told you..

1765
01:53:44,708 --> 01:53:47,124
Shut up!
Shut up! Go from here. Get out.

1766
01:53:59,374 --> 01:54:01,416
He is here.

1767
01:54:03,596 --> 01:54:05,916
Mom, where is papa going?

1768
01:54:23,874 --> 01:54:25,208
Papa!

1769
01:54:26,684 --> 01:54:29,416
I am sorry, papa!

1770
01:54:31,685 --> 01:54:33,999
I am sorry, papa!

1771
01:54:36,083 --> 01:54:37,954
For being so rude.

1772
01:54:39,049 --> 01:54:39,874
Fire!

1773
01:54:40,146 --> 01:54:41,615
Fire!
- Papa!

1774
01:54:42,126 --> 01:54:44,586
Fire!
- Shoot him to death.

1775
01:54:44,666 --> 01:54:46,781
No!
- Papa!

1776
01:54:56,758 --> 01:55:01,067
Police is shooting at
Ajay Mehra's chopper.

1777
01:55:42,896 --> 01:55:44,570
He's dumping fuel.
- What do you mean?

1778
01:55:44,653 --> 01:55:45,862
It's not safe. We have to go.

1779
01:55:45,945 --> 01:55:46,903
No way.

1780
01:56:02,420 --> 01:56:03,737
Sir, we have to go.
- How dare he!

1781
01:56:03,820 --> 01:56:05,362
We have to get out of here now!
- Leave me.

1782
01:56:05,445 --> 01:56:07,365
Sir, we need to get
you somewhere safe.

1783
01:56:07,445 --> 01:56:09,403
No way.
- Get him out of here.

1784
01:56:09,487 --> 01:56:10,570
I'll finish him.

1785
01:56:10,653 --> 01:56:12,445
I will ruin him.

1786
01:56:19,245 --> 01:56:22,487
Lord save me.
- What does he think of himself?

1787
01:56:58,046 --> 01:57:00,028
My family!
My family!

1788
01:57:00,112 --> 01:57:02,957
Ajay Mehra has taken the
chopper inside Bansal Mansion.

1789
01:57:20,902 --> 01:57:22,048
Move it.

1790
01:57:22,539 --> 01:57:23,936
Move.

1791
01:58:10,016 --> 01:58:12,512
Put the gun down.

1792
01:58:16,149 --> 01:58:19,561
Papa..
- I said, put the gun down.

1793
01:58:25,467 --> 01:58:28,300
Now, we are just going to kill you.

1794
01:58:28,676 --> 01:58:30,967
With our bad hands.

1795
01:58:37,258 --> 01:58:38,175
Papa..

1796
01:58:40,675 --> 01:58:41,675
Papa..

1797
01:58:43,342 --> 01:58:44,342
Papa!

1798
01:58:46,842 --> 01:58:48,175
Papa!

1799
01:58:59,175 --> 01:59:00,361
Papa!

1800
01:59:04,050 --> 01:59:05,110
Papa..

1801
01:59:13,967 --> 01:59:14,758
Papa!

1802
01:59:18,258 --> 01:59:19,092
Papa!

1803
01:59:33,008 --> 01:59:33,883
Papa!

1804
01:59:34,758 --> 01:59:35,842
Papa!

1805
01:59:55,633 --> 01:59:56,819
Papa!

1806
01:59:57,420 --> 01:59:58,739
Papa!

1807
02:00:02,842 --> 02:00:03,842
Papa!

1808
02:00:08,800 --> 02:00:09,842
Papa!

1809
02:00:10,258 --> 02:00:12,313
Dear, I am fine.

1810
02:00:12,633 --> 02:00:13,800
I am coming, my child.

1811
02:00:13,883 --> 02:00:14,800
Papa!

1812
02:00:14,883 --> 02:00:16,590
Don't be scared, Ananya.

1813
02:00:16,670 --> 02:00:18,095
Don't worry.
- Raj!

1814
02:00:18,175 --> 02:00:21,595
I am coming!
- Help me Papa!

1815
02:00:21,675 --> 02:00:22,690
Raj!

1816
02:00:22,770 --> 02:00:24,353
I will be there.

1817
02:00:24,433 --> 02:00:27,524
Don't worry. I am coming, Ananya.
- Raj!

1818
02:00:30,436 --> 02:00:33,137
Raj.
- Be brave, my child.

1819
02:00:35,235 --> 02:00:39,524
Papa.
- Help! Raj!

1820
02:00:40,728 --> 02:00:43,377
Get water.

1821
02:00:44,422 --> 02:00:47,697
Help!
- I will be there.

1822
02:00:49,047 --> 02:00:50,781
Help!

1823
02:00:56,010 --> 02:00:58,215
Raj! Help!

1824
02:00:58,295 --> 02:00:59,967
Move, come on.
Come on, don't be scared.

1825
02:01:00,050 --> 02:01:02,823
Don't be scared, son. Come on.

1826
02:01:02,903 --> 02:01:03,872
Come on.

1827
02:01:03,952 --> 02:01:05,050
Don't worry.

1828
02:01:05,719 --> 02:01:07,428
Come on let's go. Let's go.

1829
02:01:07,508 --> 02:01:08,848
Move, come.

1830
02:01:09,217 --> 02:01:10,402
Mom..

1831
02:01:11,129 --> 02:01:13,833
Papa!
- Raj!

1832
02:01:14,691 --> 02:01:17,014
Son..
- Papa!

1833
02:01:22,112 --> 02:01:23,565
Ajay Mehra!

1834
02:01:24,148 --> 02:01:25,553
Come out!

1835
02:01:25,633 --> 02:01:30,245
If you got the guts, come face me!

1836
02:01:31,517 --> 02:01:34,092
How dare you crash
into my house!

1837
02:01:35,121 --> 02:01:36,324
My child..

1838
02:01:37,074 --> 02:01:38,558
You have come to save
your daughter, right?

1839
02:01:38,708 --> 02:01:41,958
Come, save her.
- Don't touch my daughter.

1840
02:01:48,135 --> 02:01:50,458
Papa!

1841
02:01:55,833 --> 02:01:56,875
No!

1842
02:02:09,625 --> 02:02:11,375
Papa..

1843
02:02:30,070 --> 02:02:31,250
Ajay, it is my fault.

1844
02:02:31,333 --> 02:02:33,336
Uncle, please don't hurt my brother.

1845
02:02:33,416 --> 02:02:36,793
Please, don't.
Please don't hurt my brother..

1846
02:02:36,873 --> 02:02:38,252
Please don't..
- Please forgive us.

1847
02:02:38,332 --> 02:02:39,506
Please forgive us.
- Please forgive us.

1848
02:02:39,586 --> 02:02:41,132
Please.
- Please forgive us.

1849
02:02:41,212 --> 02:02:44,134
Please spare him. Please..
- Please forgive us.

1850
02:02:44,214 --> 02:02:45,762
Please.

1851
02:02:45,842 --> 02:02:48,431
Please spare his life.
We apologize.

1852
02:02:48,581 --> 02:02:51,994
Please forgive us.
- Please... sorry.

1853
02:02:52,074 --> 02:02:53,582
Please.

1854
02:02:53,831 --> 02:02:55,409
Brother!
- Kabir!

1855
02:02:55,489 --> 02:02:56,666
Brother!

1856
02:03:13,572 --> 02:03:15,791
I am sorry, dear.

1857
02:03:16,412 --> 02:03:17,583
I am sorry.

1858
02:03:19,022 --> 02:03:20,696
I am sorry.

1859
02:03:20,776 --> 02:03:22,416
I am sorry.

1860
02:03:24,765 --> 02:03:26,643
Papa..

1861
02:03:27,043 --> 02:03:29,233
I've been stupid.

1862
02:03:29,313 --> 02:03:31,073
I am sorry.

1863
02:03:35,460 --> 02:03:38,317
I am sorry, I didn't know.

1864
02:03:38,397 --> 02:03:40,375
I had no idea.

1865
02:03:43,062 --> 02:03:44,837
No...

1866
02:03:46,775 --> 02:03:48,148
Dear ..

1867
02:03:48,228 --> 02:03:50,621
Love you papa.

1868
02:03:50,894 --> 02:03:52,881
Love you dear.

1869
02:04:06,413 --> 02:04:07,983
Open the gate.

1870
02:04:14,895 --> 02:04:17,537
Because of you...
- Forgive me, son.

1871
02:04:17,617 --> 02:04:19,069
Because of them..

1872
02:04:19,321 --> 02:04:20,111
Hi.

1873
02:04:20,194 --> 02:04:21,697
Hello sir.
- Hello.

1874
02:04:21,777 --> 02:04:22,861
Hello madam.

1875
02:04:22,941 --> 02:04:24,589
How are you?
- So sweet flowers.

1876
02:04:24,669 --> 02:04:25,875
How are you feeling?

1877
02:04:25,955 --> 02:04:27,319
Ajay.

1878
02:04:29,358 --> 02:04:30,531
Thank you.

1879
02:04:36,404 --> 02:04:40,095
"All you need is a spark.."

1880
02:04:40,800 --> 02:04:43,973
"To start a fire."

1881
02:04:45,124 --> 02:04:47,348
"That spark.."

1882
02:04:47,428 --> 02:04:49,473
"Lies dormant.."

1883
02:04:49,639 --> 02:04:53,056
"In your heart."

1884
02:04:54,003 --> 02:04:57,556
"The way this world is.."

1885
02:04:57,636 --> 02:05:01,801
"Let it stay that way."

1886
02:05:02,777 --> 02:05:04,958
"Tell me.."

1887
02:05:05,038 --> 02:05:11,836
"What's the fun in
leading such a life?"

1888
02:05:28,894 --> 02:05:32,473
"All you need is a spark.."

1889
02:05:33,344 --> 02:05:37,136
"To start a fire."

1890
02:05:38,033 --> 02:05:40,014
"That spark.."

1891
02:05:40,413 --> 02:05:42,264
"Lies dormant.."

1892
02:05:42,344 --> 02:05:45,598
"In your heart."

1893
02:05:46,014 --> 02:05:50,098
"Why do you complain?"

1894
02:05:50,536 --> 02:05:54,748
"First stop being a pain."

1895
02:05:54,828 --> 02:06:02,139
"To make an ocean,
every drop helps."

1896
02:06:03,532 --> 02:06:08,078
"The first step, you take."

1897
02:06:08,158 --> 02:06:12,643
"An oath, you make."

1898
02:06:12,723 --> 02:06:20,186
"You don't know in you God dwells."

1899
02:06:40,012 --> 02:06:44,326
"There are millions
excuses for failure."

1900
02:06:44,525 --> 02:06:48,264
"Who can you blame?"

1901
02:06:49,008 --> 02:06:53,537
"But it is also our responsibility."

1902
02:06:53,617 --> 02:06:57,584
"This I can surely claim."

1903
02:06:57,664 --> 02:07:02,225
"We can see what's happening."

1904
02:07:02,305 --> 02:07:06,366
"Why should we shy away?"

1905
02:07:06,446 --> 02:07:11,134
"We should be determined.."

1906
02:07:11,214 --> 02:07:14,531
"To change the situation."

1907
02:07:14,611 --> 02:07:19,901
"Listen, my dear friend, I pray."

1908
02:07:19,981 --> 02:07:25,605
"To what the heart says."

1909
02:07:27,572 --> 02:07:31,802
"The truth.."

1910
02:07:32,261 --> 02:07:36,698
"Is close to you."

1911
02:07:36,778 --> 02:07:39,124
"If you seek.."

1912
02:07:39,204 --> 02:07:41,425
"You shall find them.."

1913
02:07:41,505 --> 02:07:45,209
"In the mirror."

1914
02:07:45,646 --> 02:07:49,098
"The way this world is.."

1915
02:07:49,350 --> 02:07:54,238
"Let it stay that way."

1916
02:07:54,564 --> 02:08:02,258
"Tell me, what's the
fun in leading such a life?"

1917
02:08:02,631 --> 02:08:06,848
"Why do you complain?"

1918
02:08:06,928 --> 02:08:11,368
"First stop being a pain."

1919
02:08:11,448 --> 02:08:18,929
"To make an ocean, every drop helps."

1920
02:08:20,420 --> 02:08:24,753
"The first step, you take."

1921
02:08:24,833 --> 02:08:29,148
"An oath, you make."

1922
02:08:29,228 --> 02:08:36,360
"You don't know in you God dwells."

1923
02:08:37,772 --> 02:08:45,189
"You don't know in you God dwells."

1924
02:08:46,546 --> 02:08:54,274
"You don't know in you God dwells."
