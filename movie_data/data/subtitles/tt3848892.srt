'...that, there's no glory
in dying on our own land.'

'After countless
meetings and debates...'

money, it was finally decided...'

Jai Hind, sir.
- Jai Hind.

45
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,843
Sir, we've traced Rakesh.

46
00:05:34,933 --> 00:05:37,106
They're constantly changing his
profile photos using his own phone.

47
00:05:37,167 --> 00:05:38,373
God damn it!

48
00:05:38,567 --> 00:05:40,274
Someone from his
family might see this.

49
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:41,607
Block it immediately.
- Sure, sir.

50
00:05:44,767 --> 00:05:46,212
Kill him.

51
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,908
One more time, just finish him fast.
- Yeah.

52
00:05:51,167 --> 00:05:52,373
Losing now.

53
00:05:54,433 --> 00:05:55,639
Jamal turned on us.

54
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,111
He got Rakesh captured.

55
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,679
They're planning serial blasts, sir.

56
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:00,576
Where?
- Somewhere in Delhi.

57
00:06:00,767 --> 00:06:01,871
He's the handler for Lashkar...

58
00:06:01,933 --> 00:06:03,105
When?
- Today!

59
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,401
We don't know anything else.

00:06:04,467 --> 00:06:05,309
No specifics.

What's going on?
- They're discussing.

67
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,205
One wants to help,
and the other one is stopping him.

68
00:06:35,267 --> 00:06:36,940
Someone's using Rakesh's phone.

69
00:06:37,433 --> 00:06:39,140
Sameer's sending you the coordinates.

70
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,777
Leave now!
- Yes.

71
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:43,746
If the permission had come, why do we
still keep him? let us leave him.

72
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,778
We are waiting for the intel
about him, we will act accordingly.

I want to see you

You can't do this.
- Why?

00:17:53,067 --> 00:17:54,137
Don't you remember?

Congratulations!

137
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:26,176
Young Mohsin's going to be a martyr.

138
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:31,906
It's just that he doesn't know what
a big a****e his father is.

139
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,840
And, if you wanted
to see him die so soon...

140
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,538
...why did bring him into this world
in the first place?

00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,278
Yes!

142
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:47,047
Makes Jamal's family stand right
in the middle of the Mall. - No.

143
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,937
Why is Mohsin crying?

144
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,279
Tell him...soon his
hunger will be satiated.

145
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:00,107

Any casualty on our side?

160
00:21:19,267 --> 00:21:20,371
Negative.

You were one of my own.

00:21:36,167 --> 00:21:37,942
There are going to be so
many fireworks this year.

166
00:21:39,167 --> 00:21:40,544
How many can you stop?

167
00:21:43,267 --> 00:21:44,507
You can take him in.

168
00:21:51,133 --> 00:21:52,510
Jamal!

169
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:11,712
How would I know that he will jump...

Tell them to get active.

184
00:24:02,433 --> 00:24:03,343
Yes.

185
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:06,811
The ATS are starting
to connect the dots.

186
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:08,940
Yes, I will.

187
00:24:10,167 --> 00:24:12,579
The Delhi Mission failed.

188
00:24:16,667 --> 00:24:17,907
Amazing...

189
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,207
These guys can't even
keep their pants up...

190
00:24:22,133 --> 00:24:23,737
...and they dream to be Martyrs.

191
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,076
Taufiq bhai was asking...

192
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,810
...the date's drawing closer.

193
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:40,346
If you could tell us
where do we have to place the stuff.

194
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:47,442
Tell Taufiq if he's so concerned...

195
00:24:48,867 --> 00:24:50,676
...then first get me out of here.

196
00:24:53,433 --> 00:24:55,037
I am not a”

197
00:24:59,633 --> 00:25:03,410
I heard that Kasab
was given an AIC cell.

198
00:25:05,767 --> 00:25:07,838
I've obviously done more than him.

199
00:25:21,833 --> 00:25:22,504
Hello.

200
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,943
He isn't listening.

201
00:25:24,534 --> 00:25:26,445
Says call up the neighbors first.

202
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,474
First he wants out of here.

203
00:25:28,933 --> 00:25:30,469
Only then will He cooperate.

204
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,370
What?

205
00:25:50,434 --> 00:25:52,107
Where they caught?

206
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:55,141
No, they attained salvation.

207
00:25:56,667 --> 00:25:58,704
Allah have mercy.

208
00:25:59,533 --> 00:26:04,573
Do you know why our
these little efforts failing?

209
00:26:07,133 --> 00:26:10,740
Allah wants us
to do something big.

210
00:26:11,467 --> 00:26:12,878
Amen.

211
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:18,003
Take a trip to India, Javed.

212
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,670
Yes.

213
00:26:21,567 --> 00:26:24,810
It's time to get Bilal Khan out.

214

'Chants'

220
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:11,749
I started this mission
with the grace of Allah.

221
00:27:13,033 --> 00:27:16,845
Ijust received news...

222
00:27:17,267 --> 00:27:24,412
...America's put a bounty...

223
00:27:24,767 --> 00:27:29,375
...of 10 million Dollars on my...
On Maulana Mohammad Rehman's head.

224
00:27:29,434 --> 00:27:34,281
And India is really
happy to hear this.

225
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:38,104
I want to advice...

226
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:45,510
...America and
India on this occasion.

227
00:27:47,134 --> 00:27:51,241
They should direct their
time...and their monies...

228
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:57,907
...for their people.

229
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:04,251
Contribute it for the progress...

230
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,449
...of our Muslim brothers
and sisters living in their countries.

231
00:28:10,333 --> 00:28:12,142
Because...

232
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,610
...Mohammad Rehman...

233
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,949
...cannot be caught...

234
00:28:22,633 --> 00:28:25,944
...until America
recedes from Pakistan...

235
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:31,842
...and Kashmir recedes from India!

236
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:37,612
'Chants'

237
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:41,580
India claims that yesterday...

238
00:28:41,634 --> 00:28:43,978
...we killed some of
their men on the border.

239
00:28:44,067 --> 00:28:45,705
'Chants'

240
00:28:45,767 --> 00:28:49,112

241
00:28:49,167 --> 00:28:51,272
'Chants'

242
00:28:51,334 --> 00:28:56,943
What were they doing on our land?

243
00:28:59,267 --> 00:29:04,114
This has always
been India's attitude.

244
00:29:04,967 --> 00:29:07,470
They always project that
it's entirely our mistake.

245
00:29:07,533 --> 00:29:11,982
'Chants'

246
00:29:12,034 --> 00:29:16,540

249
00:29:36,067 --> 00:29:37,478
Morning, gentlemen.
- Good morning.

250
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:38,341
Have a seat, Feroz.

251
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,344
Thank you, sir.

252
00:29:40,534 --> 00:29:41,842
It was close.

253
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,944
What was Rakesh doing in Istanbul?

254
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,444
We had an agent Jamal,
who turned rogue.

255
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:52,006
He was recruiting for
Lashkar and Islamic Jihad.

256
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,537
Rakesh was on a mission to finish him.

257
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,375
But Jamal got better of him.

258
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,212
You're making quite a
good habit of all this, Feroz.

259
00:29:59,567 --> 00:30:00,773
You saved lives.

260
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,372
Their failures...

261
00:30:02,633 --> 00:30:05,614
Their continuous failure
is very soon going to demoralize them.

262
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:06,974
Congratulations.

263
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,104
Congrats, Feroz.

264
00:30:09,167 --> 00:30:11,545
With due respect,
sir, I beg to differ.

265
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,038
With which pan?

266
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,511
They're not failing, sir.

267
00:30:15,267 --> 00:30:16,837
Jamal was my man.

268
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:18,938
He worked under me.

269
00:30:19,434 --> 00:30:20,845
It's ourfailure...

270
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:23,376
...that he left us and
joined the enemy.

271
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,270
Jamal was a traitor.

272
00:30:25,467 --> 00:30:26,844
It's not that simple.

273
00:30:27,267 --> 00:30:28,940
Jamal was an Indian.

274
00:30:29,733 --> 00:30:30,871
The point being?

275
00:30:30,933 --> 00:30:33,914
In the Taj attack,
the man who gave out instructions...

276
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,174
...from Karachi's control room,
Zabi-Uddin-Ansari...

277
00:30:37,867 --> 00:30:41,576
...known as Abu Jindal,
also known as Abu Hamza...

278
00:30:41,834 --> 00:30:43,245
...is not a Pakistani.

279
00:30:43,833 --> 00:30:45,870
He's an Indian by birth.

280
00:30:46,367 --> 00:30:48,540
These terrorist organizations
have succeeded...

281
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:52,412
...in convincing people,
that India is not their country.

282
00:30:52,834 --> 00:30:56,839
And to act against it,
by using their religion as tool.

283
00:30:57,534 --> 00:31:00,481
And now, our children
are being recruited...

284
00:31:01,367 --> 00:31:05,474
...from right under our noses,
for terrorist training camps.

285
00:31:06,533 --> 00:31:09,309
And after completing
their training...

286
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:13,008
...they come back
from Sri Lanka, Bangladesh or Nepal.

287
00:31:14,233 --> 00:31:16,235
Using Facebook and Twitter...

288
00:31:16,667 --> 00:31:18,408
...anyone can trigger a riot...

289
00:31:18,767 --> 00:31:22,078
...in any pan of our country
right from his sitting desk.

290
00:31:22,633 --> 00:31:24,874
What they couldn't achieve
from the outside.

291
00:31:25,333 --> 00:31:28,041
Is now getting initiated from within.

292
00:31:28,333 --> 00:31:32,213
And the bitter truth is, if
the members of the community feel...

293
00:31:32,267 --> 00:31:35,714
...they do not belong here,
and they're losing faith in us.

294
00:31:36,933 --> 00:31:37,843
Then...

295
00:31:38,633 --> 00:31:42,740
...that is the terrorist
organization's biggest success...

296
00:31:43,033 --> 00:31:44,808
...and our biggest failure, sir.

297
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:56,808
Greetings, brother.

298
00:31:56,867 --> 00:31:58,175
Greetings.

299
00:31:58,434 --> 00:31:59,708
Greetings.

300
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:04,970
Please come.

301
00:32:47,867 --> 00:32:49,175
Why didn't you call?

302
00:32:50,733 --> 00:32:52,576
I thought I'll surprise you.

303
00:32:53,333 --> 00:32:54,573
You're still awake.

304
00:32:55,133 --> 00:32:56,339
Was reading something.

305
00:32:57,534 --> 00:32:58,604
I missed you.

306
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,306
I missed you too.

307
00:33:03,167 --> 00:33:04,805
When will you stop lying?

308
00:33:18,067 --> 00:33:19,546
Arjun doesn't...

309
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,908
...but this naughty one keeps
asking of you all the time.

310
00:33:37,767 --> 00:33:38,905
I need a drink.

311
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,172
You'll have something?

312
00:33:40,233 --> 00:33:41,041
No!

313
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,479
How was your...
- Conference?

314
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,270
Same old...boring.

315
00:33:46,967 --> 00:33:48,037
Come, I'll tell you.

316
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,646
The presentation
was on the 3rd Day.

317
00:33:56,834 --> 00:33:59,246
Mr. Shukla was fiddling
with the computer.

318
00:33:59,734 --> 00:34:01,145
But he couldn't turn it on.

319
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,043
He started sweating.

320
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:05,441
People were
wondering what's wrong.

321
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,173
I was wondering too.

322
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,913
Later we realized that
Mr. Shukla...

323
00:34:11,534 --> 00:34:13,309
...hasn't pressed the power button.

324
00:34:15,567 --> 00:34:18,446
Why do you always make up a story?

325
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:22,671
I can understand, you
can't share your work with me.

326
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:28,648
You'll need a story,
it's important.

327
00:34:31,333 --> 00:34:32,471
Why?

328
00:34:35,467 --> 00:34:37,310
What if I don't return someday?

329
00:34:40,067 --> 00:34:42,104
There must be some story about me.

330
00:34:43,334 --> 00:34:46,144
For Arjun, you...Ananya.

331
00:34:46,534 --> 00:34:47,842
Our friends.

332
00:34:49,333 --> 00:34:50,471
You know how it is.

333
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:51,901
Shut up!

334
00:34:52,867 --> 00:34:54,574
I told you let's not get married.

335
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:59,377
Yes, and when I said let's not...

336
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:02,205
...then why did you keep chasing me?

337
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:04,608
I didn't want to lose you.

338
00:35:09,167 --> 00:35:10,805
I don't love you.

339
00:35:23,567 --> 00:35:30,177
"L don't...love you."

340
00:35:30,234 --> 00:35:36,515
"l don't...love you."

341
00:35:36,567 --> 00:35:43,075
"But every single evening..."

342
00:35:43,134 --> 00:35:48,134
"...l wait for you."

343
00:35:56,567 --> 00:36:03,212
"l don't...love you."

344
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:10,809
"But the day you're not here..."

345
00:36:11,234 --> 00:36:17,082
"The city seems strange."

346
00:36:17,934 --> 00:36:23,714
"Every bud looks unknown."

347
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:31,007
"Every1hing feels unfamiliar."

348
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:35,105
"l love you."

349
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:44,043
The hearing on Jamshed Rashid,
aka Bilal Khan's case just ended.

350
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,170
Today's case was dismissed...

351
00:36:45,234 --> 00:36:47,680
...due to absence of witnesses.

352
00:36:47,767 --> 00:36:50,907
The next hearing
is on 4th of the next month.

353
00:36:50,967 --> 00:36:52,674
And as you can see, behind me...

354
00:38:16,567 --> 00:38:17,739
Yes.

355
00:38:18,534 --> 00:38:19,945
The van is coming.

356
00:39:27,467 --> 00:39:28,946
Stay there.

357
00:39:33,034 --> 00:39:34,604
Stay there.

358
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:16,944
Hello.

359
00:41:23,167 --> 00:41:24,874
In breaking news...Bilal Khan...

360
00:41:24,967 --> 00:41:28,915
...who was arrested last month from
Nagpur for a serial blast case...

361
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,071
...has managed to flee from custody.

362
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,008
<i>OKZiY-</i>

363
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:34,636
You are going to get a
day off school today.

364
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,343
Yes.
- Okay.

365
00:41:36,434 --> 00:41:37,640
Where are we going?

366
00:41:38,067 --> 00:41:39,341
Shopping-

367
00:41:39,434 --> 00:41:40,572
Shopping-

368
00:41:40,634 --> 00:41:41,772
Movie.

And then movie.

370
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:43,539
Doremon 2.

00:41:43,633 --> 00:41:45,544
We'll go watch Doremon 2.
- Doremon 5.

372
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:48,876
And then we'll go have dinner.

373
00:41:48,967 --> 00:41:52,039
After lunch,
we'll go to the ice-skating rink.

374
00:41:52,534 --> 00:41:53,979
We'll go for a picnic.

375
00:41:54,034 --> 00:41:55,707
Okay then we'll go for a picnic.

376
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,107
We'll have great fun.

377
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,708
Yes, we'll have great fun.

378
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:03,543
Papa's phone is ringing again.

379
00:42:07,934 --> 00:42:08,912
Yes.

380
00:42:11,467 --> 00:42:12,605
On my WaY-

381
00:42:22,534 --> 00:42:23,979
Just don't die.

382
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,743
Javed Khan is in Mumbai.

383
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:02,938
That explains?

384
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,173
Sir, that explains every1hing.

385
00:43:14,034 --> 00:43:16,207
These are the Airport
CCTV footage grabs.

386
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:17,711
Arrived from Dubai yesterday.

387
00:43:17,767 --> 00:43:18,871
Is it him?

388
00:43:19,667 --> 00:43:20,839
That's him, sir.

389
00:43:21,434 --> 00:43:22,936
Is he under arrest?
- No.

390
00:43:23,167 --> 00:43:25,408
ATS has received a tip,
they're waiting for us.

391
00:43:39,334 --> 00:43:40,438
Come sir.

392
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,508
Sir, that's Aftab.

393
00:43:42,734 --> 00:43:44,008
He's the one who tipped us.

394
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:47,611
Approached us after watching
the news about Bilal Khan's escape.

395
00:43:48,267 --> 00:43:49,712
And that's his father.

396
00:43:50,934 --> 00:43:51,912
Ajay.

397
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:06,870
Aftab, take a seat.

398
00:44:11,134 --> 00:44:12,408
How old are you?

399
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:15,143
Sir, I'm 23 years old.

400
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:17,438
Qualification?

401
00:44:18,767 --> 00:44:19,837
I'm an engineer, sir.

402
00:44:20,333 --> 00:44:21,937
So you're both, cool and smart.

403
00:44:25,634 --> 00:44:27,136
So tell me what do you want to share.

404
00:44:28,734 --> 00:44:32,773
Sir, I was in FSC 2nd year,
engineering when all this started.

405
00:44:33,667 --> 00:44:35,078
Sameer and Junaid were my friends.

406
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:37,976
And they introduced me to Taufiq bhai.

407
00:44:42,034 --> 00:44:43,707
Greetings.
- Greetings.

408
00:44:48,734 --> 00:44:52,238
Taufiq arranged some
private scholarships...

409
00:44:53,267 --> 00:44:55,144
...keeping my academic
performance in mind.

410
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:57,904
I thought I deserved it.

411
00:45:00,767 --> 00:45:05,011
But soon after he called
me and showed me some videos.

412
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:09,704
Videos of...

413
00:45:09,967 --> 00:45:10,843
...riots...

414
00:45:11,967 --> 00:45:12,707
...killings...

415
00:45:14,467 --> 00:45:15,810
People getting slaughtered.

416
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:19,472
I was shaken, sir.

417
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:24,246
Since that day,
I started receiving similar links...

418
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:29,049
...on my Facebook,
Twitter and Gmail accounts.

419
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:32,142
The Assam link, Gujarat link and...

420
00:45:33,467 --> 00:45:34,537
Many more.

421
00:45:35,134 --> 00:45:39,913
Around 6 months ago
I was called and told...

422
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:43,670
...that l, Sameer and
Junaid along with 2 others...

423
00:45:44,067 --> 00:45:46,809
...were going to Nepal
for special training.

424
00:45:47,267 --> 00:45:48,974
And we were also told that...

425
00:45:49,034 --> 00:45:50,843
...we were chosen amongst thousands.

426
00:45:53,867 --> 00:45:59,146
L...lied to mom and dad...

427
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,412
...that we're going on a college trip.

428
00:46:06,967 --> 00:46:10,073
Right after landing at Kathmandu
airport we were taken to Rautahat.

429
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:21,904
And after spending a night there...

430
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,379
...we were loaded on to
a truck and taken to the border.

431
00:46:43,567 --> 00:46:46,377
Our training lasted for 2 weeks.

432
00:46:48,834 --> 00:46:52,873
We were trained to assemble
improvised explosive device.

433
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:11,777
When they conducted a test...

434
00:47:13,734 --> 00:47:15,270
...they all praised me.

435
00:47:16,433 --> 00:47:17,605
Because I was the best.

436
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,440
How were you be the best?

437
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:26,010
Sir, I know how to trigger a CWID,
VOID and RCID.

438
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:27,511
Even if it's command-wire...

439
00:47:27,567 --> 00:47:30,776
...radio, cellphone
or victim operated.

440
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:32,636
I've learnt every1hing.

441
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:37,414
Sir, Taufiq bhai called
us yesterday for a meeting.

442
00:47:38,734 --> 00:47:41,442
Each of us was assigned a task.

443
00:47:42,267 --> 00:47:45,077
Some were supposed to deliver goods...

444
00:47:45,467 --> 00:47:48,073
...while others were asked
to collect some stuff.

445
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:53,212
Sir, there is an 11
year old kid amongst us.

446
00:47:53,967 --> 00:47:55,241
His name's lmran.

447
00:47:56,467 --> 00:47:58,572
Sir, he's my uncle's son.

448
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:02,847
What would he know
what right or wrong?

449
00:48:04,934 --> 00:48:06,311
What are they planning?

450
00:48:08,434 --> 00:48:09,845
I don't know, sir.

451
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:13,479
I only saw Bilal Khan's
photo in the meeting.

452
00:48:13,534 --> 00:48:14,512
And...

453
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:19,081
This morning when I saw the news.
- Where's Bilal?

454
00:48:20,867 --> 00:48:22,574
I don't know, sir.

455
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:25,269
Where's Javed.

456
00:48:26,134 --> 00:48:27,238
I don't know, sir.

457
00:48:27,634 --> 00:48:29,238
Last night few men arrived
from Pakistan.

458
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:31,211
This is our small home.

459
00:48:31,267 --> 00:48:33,178
You can call it our headquarters.

460
00:48:35,434 --> 00:48:39,007
Sameer told me that one of
them was Javed Khan.

461
00:48:39,434 --> 00:48:42,210
Only Taufiq bhai knows where they are.

462
00:48:42,634 --> 00:48:43,942
And where can I find Taufiq?

463
00:48:44,767 --> 00:48:45,837
Zeenat Mahal.

464
00:48:46,367 --> 00:48:48,313
Sir, they need Bilal.

465
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:52,147
And...they're planning something big.

466
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:56,775
Do you have any photo of Taufiq?
- Yes, sir.

467
00:48:58,967 --> 00:48:59,843
Sir...

468
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:03,143
9821311...

469
00:49:05,367 --> 00:49:06,539
Sir...

470
00:49:13,234 --> 00:49:16,613
Aftab, what you are doing needs
a lots of courage.

471
00:49:18,967 --> 00:49:19,945
Look at me.

472
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:23,438
I'm proud of you.

473
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:25,806
We're all proud of you.

474
00:49:31,267 --> 00:49:32,337
Good luck.

475
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:34,245
And cooperate with these guys.

476
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:35,540
Okay.
- Okay Sir.

477
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,809
So, Ajay, how do you want to do it?

478
00:49:39,634 --> 00:49:40,908
It's a small operation, sir.

479
00:49:41,067 --> 00:49:43,047
I would like to lead
a small team of ATS' men.

480
00:49:43,367 --> 00:49:44,345
Sounds good.

481
00:49:49,167 --> 00:49:50,669
Yes, sir, I'll keep you posted, sir.

482
00:49:51,034 --> 00:49:52,172
Okay sir.

483
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,437
Is it anyone's happy birthday today?

484
00:49:56,534 --> 00:49:57,774
No.
- No, sir.

485
00:49:58,234 --> 00:50:01,147
Sir, it's my marriage anniversary.

486
00:50:01,367 --> 00:50:02,437
How many years has it been, Gawde?

487
00:50:02,534 --> 00:50:03,410
16 years sir.

488
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:06,011
If you have survived your
marriage of 16 years...

489
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:07,078
...you'll survive this too.

490
00:50:07,134 --> 00:50:08,135
Don't worry.

491
00:50:08,333 --> 00:50:10,973
Sir, with you around
we've got nothing to worry.

492
00:50:11,067 --> 00:50:12,341
In fact, we enjoy it.

493
00:50:12,434 --> 00:50:16,814
Sir you don't recall but we were
together during the opera house ops.

494
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:18,773
Gawde, what happened
to your moustache?

495
00:50:19,934 --> 00:50:22,141
Sir because of the
marriage anniversary...

496
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:24,510
...my wife asked me
to sport a clean look.

497
00:50:41,167 --> 00:50:42,771
Move. Move.

498
00:50:45,434 --> 00:50:46,538
Move.

499
00:50:46,967 --> 00:50:48,002
Move.

500
00:50:58,167 --> 00:50:59,339
Uncle, where can I find Taufiq?

501
00:50:59,434 --> 00:51:01,539
Taufiq? First floor.
- Thank you.

502
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:12,212
Stand aside.

503
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:16,879
ATS Mumbai.

504
00:51:17,267 --> 00:51:19,247
We need to have a small chat.

505
00:51:31,133 --> 00:51:33,374
Let me tell you something.

506
00:51:46,534 --> 00:51:48,810
These people love me a lot.

507
00:51:49,567 --> 00:51:53,845
As long as you're here, they will stop
all work and keep standing outside.

508
00:51:54,834 --> 00:51:57,906
And the crowd outside
Zeenat Mahal will also keep growing.

509
00:51:58,967 --> 00:52:01,709
So...what brings you here?

510
00:52:01,767 --> 00:52:04,247
Where are Bilal and Javed Ali Khan?

511
00:52:06,767 --> 00:52:08,906
What would you like to have?
Some tea, coffee, cold drink?

512
00:52:08,967 --> 00:52:10,844
Some other time,
I'm in a bit of a hurry today.

513
00:52:11,233 --> 00:52:12,803
I just want two people,

514
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:15,512
Where are Bilal and Javed Ali Khan?

515
00:52:16,367 --> 00:52:20,474
Let me...tell you a small story.

516
00:52:22,067 --> 00:52:23,512
Listen carefully.

517
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:27,076
Remember the 2008 bomb blasts.

518
00:52:27,567 --> 00:52:30,138
Two days later the
police stormed at my place.

519
00:52:30,633 --> 00:52:31,737
Someone tipped them that...

520
00:52:31,834 --> 00:52:34,178
...some kids from
the Indian Mujahiddin...

521
00:52:34,534 --> 00:52:36,445
...have sought refuge here.

522
00:52:37,534 --> 00:52:41,277
They interrogated me continuously for
three days in their own style.

523
00:52:41,367 --> 00:52:43,244
But I didn't utter a word.

524
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:46,743
I knew! But no!

525
00:52:48,934 --> 00:52:51,175
Two days later, those kids...

526
00:52:51,434 --> 00:52:53,243
...reached their destination,
safe and sound.

527
00:52:54,367 --> 00:52:57,541
Some ba*** betrayed us, but not me.

528
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:03,676
You know that religion
column that we have?

529
00:53:04,734 --> 00:53:09,581
I write Muslim, in Bold and Capital.

530
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:14,246
And now about your question?

531
00:53:15,367 --> 00:53:16,778
Who Bilal?

532
00:53:18,633 --> 00:53:20,408
Who Javed Ali Khan?

533
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:22,538
Let me tell you a small story too.

534
00:53:25,367 --> 00:53:26,869
I was in the Para-Military forces.

535
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:30,410
We were deployed in
Gujarafs Hindu-Muslim riots.

536
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:34,074
We received an alert,
that a Muslim family...

537
00:53:34,467 --> 00:53:36,003
...comprising of mother, father,
13 year old kid...

538
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:37,238
...they were stuck in the interiors.

539
00:53:37,567 --> 00:53:40,946
And a radical Hindu militant
organization had got news of them.

540
00:53:41,967 --> 00:53:43,913
My colleagues were occupied...

541
00:53:43,967 --> 00:53:46,914
...and since I was the closest,
I responded.

542
00:53:47,667 --> 00:53:49,340
When I arrived at the location,
the family thought...

543
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:50,970
...that I was there to kill them.

544
00:53:51,234 --> 00:53:53,043
After a great difficulty
they were assured.

545
00:53:53,667 --> 00:53:56,443
In the evening, the crowd
arrived waving the Hindutva flag...

546
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:58,776
...with swords, guns and petrol bombs.

547
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:04,206
I fought alone...for 24 hours.

548
00:54:05,267 --> 00:54:06,644
I was also shot twice.

549
00:54:07,434 --> 00:54:09,311
Seven people were killed
by me that day.

550
00:54:10,134 --> 00:54:12,273
But I kept that family safe and didn't
allow one scratch on the family.

551
00:54:16,033 --> 00:54:17,979
That religion column
that you were talking about"

552
00:54:18,934 --> 00:54:21,608
...we write 'lndian'
in Bold and Capital there.

553
00:54:28,367 --> 00:54:33,214
Look, if even get a scratch on me...

554
00:54:33,267 --> 00:54:34,405
Why would you get a scratch?

555
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:52,208
Come on.

556
00:54:52,267 --> 00:54:54,110
Everyone, come on...

557
00:54:54,867 --> 00:54:56,904
Everyone, come on...

558
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:57,774
Get down.

559
00:55:12,434 --> 00:55:13,913
Everyone, come on...

560
00:55:14,367 --> 00:55:15,641
Come on.

561
00:55:22,034 --> 00:55:24,241
Sir he want to say something.

562
00:55:24,667 --> 00:55:26,271
Are you sure?
- Yes sir.

563
00:55:33,767 --> 00:55:35,075
Where's Bilal?

564
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:38,272
Where's Bilal?

565
00:55:39,867 --> 00:55:42,279
Only...Javed knows.

566
00:55:42,334 --> 00:55:43,608
Where's Javed?

567
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:51,312
14...Raybury Road, William Docks.

568
00:55:51,567 --> 00:55:53,137
Did you record that?
- Yes, sir.

569
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:56,374
Stay back...- I said stay back...

570
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,570
Stay back...

571
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:02,874
Stand here.
- Listen to me.

572
00:56:02,934 --> 00:56:04,106
I said stay back...

573
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:05,440
Why are you coming forward?

574
00:56:05,534 --> 00:56:06,604
Stay back...

575
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:10,104
Taufiq, those people
are standing out there...

576
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:12,938
...because they don't
know the truth about you.

577
00:56:13,534 --> 00:56:15,741
They don't know
that you're an lSl agent.

578
00:56:16,634 --> 00:56:20,172
If we don't find Javed
at this given address...

579
00:56:20,734 --> 00:56:23,340
...then we'll broadcast
this clipping on breaking news.

580
00:56:23,767 --> 00:56:27,010
And then we'll see how much
These guys really love you.

581
00:56:27,433 --> 00:56:28,776
Move.

582
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:54,146
Move back.

583
00:56:54,234 --> 00:56:56,077
Move. Move.

584
00:56:56,634 --> 00:56:58,238
Move...

585
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,070
Move...

586
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:05,908
Yes, AjaY-

587
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,070
Sir, we've an address.

588
00:57:07,167 --> 00:57:08,145
We're heading there.

589
00:57:08,234 --> 00:57:10,339
I'm sending you a video-clip, sir.
It's just an update.

590
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:11,845
And needs no action, sir.

591
00:57:12,267 --> 00:57:13,075
Are you okay?

592
00:57:13,134 --> 00:57:14,408
Of course, sir.
I'll call you back.

593
00:57:14,667 --> 00:57:15,611
Good.

594
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:19,269
Gawde, you have to throw
a party after this is over.

595
00:57:19,367 --> 00:57:20,505
Of course, sir.

596
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:45,242
I reached there,
but he was stuck in traffic.

597
00:57:47,433 --> 00:57:48,810
Now not me...

598
00:58:12,267 --> 00:58:13,575
Usmaan!

599
00:58:43,567 --> 00:58:47,037
Javed Khan, hands up.

600
00:58:50,634 --> 00:58:52,443
Gawde.
- Yes, sir.

601
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:55,273
You wanted an anniversary present,
didn't you?

602
00:58:55,534 --> 00:58:58,037
Will an imported one do?
- Of course, sir.

603
00:58:58,434 --> 00:58:59,538
Take him in.

604
00:59:00,334 --> 00:59:02,280
We need to show him our hospitality.

605
01:00:48,234 --> 01:00:50,373
News has just come in
from William Dock, Mumbai...

606
01:00:50,467 --> 01:00:53,038
...where one of the most dreaded
terrorist Javed Ali, from LeT...

607
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:56,081
...killed himself and 4 police
officers in a suicide explosion.

608
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:58,944
One officer was also reportedly
injured in the attack.

609
01:00:59,433 --> 01:01:01,538
ATS Mumbai carried
out the operation...

610
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:03,602
...led by a tip
and raided the compound.

611
01:01:03,700 --> 01:01:06,237
They were successful
in gunning down 8 terrorists.

612
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:29,512
Excuse me sir, something to drink?

613
01:02:02,834 --> 01:02:04,939
Firstly, Rehman sir...

614
01:02:05,133 --> 01:02:07,841
...the allegation made by India.

615
01:02:08,133 --> 01:02:10,807
Regarding the recent
terrorist attacks...

616
01:02:11,067 --> 01:02:12,740
...and Bilal Khan's escape.

617
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:17,376
Your name always comes up
along with these incidents.

618
01:02:17,834 --> 01:02:19,711
What is your opinion about it?

619
01:02:20,234 --> 01:02:24,683
India is a disturbed nation.

620
01:02:26,567 --> 01:02:28,569
Rehman sir,
you didn't answer my question.

621
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:30,074
Idid.

622
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:33,208
India is a disturbed nation!

623
01:02:34,067 --> 01:02:35,444
Why is India disturbed?

624
01:02:35,667 --> 01:02:37,340
It's their mind set.

625
01:02:38,100 --> 01:02:40,341
They're disturbed by Pakistan.

626
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:42,746
They're disturbed by me.

627
01:02:43,134 --> 01:02:45,307
Whenever anything wrong
happens in India...

628
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:49,644
...Pakistan and I get blamed for it.

629
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:53,272
India has warned that
if we don't cooperate...

630
01:02:53,333 --> 01:02:54,209
...they will launch
a surgical strike...

631
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:56,007
Bhaijaan!

632
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,742
I know India.

633
01:03:01,900 --> 01:03:04,278
They can do nothing.

634
01:03:04,934 --> 01:03:06,607
All they do is talk.

635
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:09,607
They shed tears and wail.

636
01:03:11,134 --> 01:03:16,447
They can do nothing now,
and they never ever will. lnsha allah.

637
01:03:45,034 --> 01:03:45,774
Yes, Sameer.

638
01:03:45,867 --> 01:03:47,039
Sir, please come down.

639
01:03:51,367 --> 01:03:52,402
Yes Sameer.

640
01:03:52,467 --> 01:03:54,469
Sir, Javed's hard drive is on.

641
01:03:54,834 --> 01:03:55,608
See.

642
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:02,114
Isn't that Wasim Sheikh?
- Yes, sir.

643
01:04:02,167 --> 01:04:04,010
Last seen in Karachi, in 2011.

644
01:04:04,767 --> 01:04:08,044
Butmaccording to IB he's dead.

645
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:09,640
No, sir, lB's wrong.

646
01:04:09,700 --> 01:04:11,202
He's alive and is in Nepal.

647
01:04:11,567 --> 01:04:13,205
His new name is Abdul Haq.

648
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:16,476
And from out there he handles
recruitments for Lashkar and IM.

649
01:04:16,533 --> 01:04:18,479
And he also raises funds for Rehman.

650
01:04:19,034 --> 01:04:21,071
Wasim and Javed were
in constant touch with him.

651
01:04:21,167 --> 01:04:23,773
He is the one who funded Bilal's
rescue operation.

652
01:04:23,834 --> 01:04:25,541
These are few emails
shared between them.

653
01:04:26,067 --> 01:04:27,603
They have used childish code words.

654
01:04:27,667 --> 01:04:29,442
It took me less than
5 minutes to crack.

655
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:32,640
CD means Revolver.

656
01:04:32,734 --> 01:04:34,304
DVD means Assault Rifles.

657
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:36,243
Pen Drive means
Bullets and Detonators.

658
01:04:37,033 --> 01:04:39,274
They used the word 'Dawaati' here.

659
01:04:39,334 --> 01:04:41,177
It means preparation for blast.

660
01:04:41,733 --> 01:04:42,677

661
01:04:42,767 --> 01:04:43,973

H is 'Hyderabad'.

664
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:49,111
They're planning something
really nasty and big.

665
01:04:49,700 --> 01:04:51,543
And Bilal is in-charge
of the operation.

666
01:04:52,267 --> 01:04:55,976
In short, Wasim Sheikh has
all the answers to your questions.

667
01:04:56,367 --> 01:04:58,677
Can you find Wasim's
present location?

668
01:04:58,734 --> 01:05:00,304
He is in Kathmandu.

669
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:02,241
He runs a Tours and
Travels business, as a front.

670
01:05:02,534 --> 01:05:05,071
I have been tracking his online
activities since this morning.

671
01:05:05,167 --> 01:05:07,169
He spent two hours
on the internet.

672
01:05:07,267 --> 01:05:08,575
Primarily watching
Indian news sites...

673
01:05:08,667 --> 01:05:10,044
...and on-line channels.

674
01:05:10,267 --> 01:05:12,508
Later, he made an online
transfer of 12,000...

675
01:05:12,567 --> 01:05:13,978
...to his family in Lucknow.

676
01:05:14,267 --> 01:05:18,272
After that he Googled for
Sunny Leone's sexy wallpapers.

677
01:05:18,767 --> 01:05:20,405
And he was there for some time.

678
01:05:22,567 --> 01:05:24,240
Good job, Sameer. Well done.

679
01:05:24,667 --> 01:05:25,668
Thank you sir.

680
01:05:27,100 --> 01:05:28,511
What do you say, Ajay?

681
01:05:29,967 --> 01:05:32,174
Sir let's get Wasim.

682
01:05:33,034 --> 01:05:34,638
If we go through the process,
it'll take ages.

683
01:05:35,167 --> 01:05:36,305
And if we inform
the local authorities...

684
01:05:36,367 --> 01:05:37,641
...the media will find out.

685
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:39,174
Let's keep it discreet Sir.

686
01:05:40,334 --> 01:05:43,213
Did you hear Rehman's speech?
-Yes, sir. I did.

687
01:05:43,934 --> 01:05:45,140
It's our fault, sir.

688
01:05:46,067 --> 01:05:48,411
When the Americans
killed Osama in Abbottabad...

689
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:50,036
...some of our politicians
excitedly stated...

690
01:05:50,100 --> 01:05:54,242
...that, we should carry
out surgical strikes too.

691
01:05:54,334 --> 01:05:55,642
To get Abdul Rehman...

692
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:57,201
But if only they had quietly
carried out the strike...

693
01:05:57,267 --> 01:05:58,644
...instead of propagating it...

694
01:05:58,700 --> 01:06:00,771
...then today we would've
been in a better position.

695
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:02,908
How many do you need?

696
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:03,978
One!

697
01:06:04,534 --> 01:06:05,774
We'll do a honey trap,
sir and we need,

698
01:06:05,834 --> 01:06:07,245
Ground support
for our safe return.

699
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:08,574
We will keep it very simple.
In and out.

700
01:06:08,734 --> 01:06:10,941
Wasim will be our custody,
Before anyone knows.

701
01:06:11,467 --> 01:06:12,537
Sounds good.

702
01:06:14,100 --> 01:06:16,808
But...we'll have to inform
these imbeciles.

703
01:06:19,167 --> 01:06:21,238
Ijust jot that down in my diary...

704
01:06:22,867 --> 01:06:24,005
Hold on.

705
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:27,835
Yes, Feroz sir.

706
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:29,607
Mr. Gupta, how are you?

707
01:06:29,867 --> 01:06:31,278
We need to see minister sir.

708
01:06:31,634 --> 01:06:33,580
Sir is on a tight schedule.

709
01:06:33,667 --> 01:06:35,010
I suggest that you call tomorrow.

710
01:06:35,067 --> 01:06:36,375
Forget it them.

711
01:06:36,834 --> 01:06:38,404
We'll meet after the blasts.

712
01:06:38,467 --> 01:06:39,445
Hello...

713
01:06:39,934 --> 01:06:41,971
Please come, I'll arrange for it.

714
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:43,444
Yes.

715
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:46,205
Nonsense...

716
01:06:46,300 --> 01:06:47,108
Yeah...

717
01:06:52,334 --> 01:06:53,108
Have it.

718
01:06:57,100 --> 01:06:58,044
Just two more minutes.

719
01:06:58,734 --> 01:07:00,407
The BBC people are here, so...

720
01:07:06,067 --> 01:07:09,674
You see, sir has managed
to create a very peaceful ambience...

721
01:07:09,734 --> 01:07:11,042
...in the entire country.

722
01:07:11,934 --> 01:07:13,413
Even the opposition is stunned...

723
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:14,945
...about how he has got
things under control.

724
01:07:16,100 --> 01:07:17,943
Yes, It's only sir
who is doing every1hing!

725
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:20,575
You seem offended.

726
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:22,679
Who's going to lead the way?

727
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:24,677
Who's leading the way?

728
01:07:24,767 --> 01:07:25,905
Face of change.

729
01:07:27,234 --> 01:07:28,941
Yeah, face of change? Who is it?

730
01:07:29,300 --> 01:07:31,473
Of course, our Minister sir.

731
01:07:32,234 --> 01:07:33,645
You're taunting me now.

732
01:07:34,067 --> 01:07:35,273
No, Mr. Gupta.

733
01:07:35,734 --> 01:07:41,013
In just last week alone 24 of our
officers died collectively.

734
01:07:41,067 --> 01:07:43,911
But people are bound to die,
that's theirjob.

735
01:08:14,867 --> 01:08:16,107
Yes, sir.

736
01:08:16,667 --> 01:08:17,873
Okay, sir.

737
01:08:18,300 --> 01:08:21,179
Sir, this is our best
chance to find Bilal.

738
01:08:21,567 --> 01:08:22,910
Wasim is our best lead.

739
01:08:23,367 --> 01:08:26,075
When?
- In the next 24 hours, sir.

740
01:08:26,567 --> 01:08:28,478
How will you do it
without telling Nepal?

741
01:08:28,734 --> 01:08:29,542
It'll be done, sir.

742
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:31,375
We don't want to make
any noise about it, sir.

743
01:08:33,467 --> 01:08:35,208
I can't sanction this Feroz.

744
01:08:35,634 --> 01:08:37,511
Sir, nothing will
be official about it.

745
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:39,074
It'll be a covert operation.

746
01:08:39,234 --> 01:08:40,440
If something goes wrong...

747
01:08:40,634 --> 01:08:42,807
...we do not know Ajay.
- Yes sir.

748
01:08:45,634 --> 01:08:47,944
What's the plan, Feroz?
- Sorry, sir.

749
01:08:48,767 --> 01:08:49,768
What's the plan?

750
01:08:49,934 --> 01:08:51,436
I heard you the first time.

751
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:52,478
Sorry, sir.

752
01:09:02,534 --> 01:09:03,911
Excuse me, Mr. Khan.

753
01:09:05,700 --> 01:09:07,373
Would you like me
to serve you some snacks?

754
01:09:07,434 --> 01:09:09,038
No, thank you.

755
01:09:10,100 --> 01:09:11,204
Mrs. Khan?

756
01:09:11,867 --> 01:09:13,107
I'll have a glass ofjuice.

757
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:14,474
Thank you.
- Sure ma'am.

758
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:18,936
You were snoring, sir.

759
01:09:21,167 --> 01:09:22,407
Stop being my wife.

760
01:10:07,700 --> 01:10:08,906
Welcome sir.

761
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:15,908
Enjoy sir.

762
01:10:15,967 --> 01:10:17,275
Thank you.

763
01:10:48,267 --> 01:10:49,644
Take it.
- Thank you Sir.

764
01:11:25,634 --> 01:11:27,477
No need to stay
more than 5 minutes.

765
01:11:27,900 --> 01:11:30,210
Fix a meeting for tomorrow at 11,
in this hotel.

766
01:11:30,434 --> 01:11:31,708
Keep it straight and simple.

767
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:32,904
Okay? Good luck.

768
01:11:32,967 --> 01:11:33,843
Sir.

769
01:12:04,700 --> 01:12:06,976
Hi Jayesh.
- How are you?

770
01:12:07,734 --> 01:12:08,712
I'm fine.

771
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:16,004
We are on.
- Okay sir.

772
01:12:17,534 --> 01:12:19,241
Tell me.
- I'm leaving now.

773
01:12:19,734 --> 01:12:21,509
Call me in the evening.
- Okay.

774
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:26,743
Sorry.
- No problem.

775
01:12:27,034 --> 01:12:30,846
Can you please guide
me to this address?

776
01:12:40,300 --> 01:12:41,506
Where are you from?

777
01:12:42,434 --> 01:12:43,777
Mumbai.

778
01:12:47,634 --> 01:12:48,772
What for?

779
01:12:49,434 --> 01:12:51,380
To meet Mr. Abdul Haq.

780
01:12:52,101 --> 01:12:54,047
One of his contacts sent me here.

781
01:13:01,467 --> 01:13:02,411
Come.

782
01:13:17,234 --> 01:13:18,406
Sorry.
- Alright.

783
01:14:38,401 --> 01:14:39,436
Sit.

784
01:14:40,167 --> 01:14:41,578
Sit, I'll be right back.

785
01:15:55,267 --> 01:15:57,178
Abdul sahab is gone,
for a meeting.

786
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,343
I've left a message for him.

787
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:03,908
So...how can I help you?

788
01:16:05,067 --> 01:16:06,137
No.

789
01:16:06,501 --> 01:16:08,037
I want to talk to him.

790
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:11,447
Don't worry,
lam very close to him.

791
01:16:12,767 --> 01:16:14,075
Who sent you?

792
01:16:15,800 --> 01:16:17,404
I am here on behalf of Taufiq sahab.

793
01:16:18,434 --> 01:16:20,380
After his martyrdom,
I was instructed...

794
01:16:20,467 --> 01:16:23,380
...to come here and handover
a package to Mr. Abdul.

795
01:16:24,167 --> 01:16:25,237
Who sent you?

796
01:16:27,267 --> 01:16:28,610
They don't have names.

797
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:30,474
I received a phone call...

798
01:16:30,567 --> 01:16:33,241
...and next day I received
some money and tickets.

799
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:37,870
Are you alone?

800
01:16:38,334 --> 01:16:39,745
No, Rafiq's with me.

801
01:16:40,334 --> 01:16:42,439
We've been sent here
posing as husband-wife.

802
01:16:43,267 --> 01:16:44,245
Where's the packet?

803
01:16:45,067 --> 01:16:46,273
At the hotel.

804
01:16:48,534 --> 01:16:50,104
How will you recognize Abdul sahab?

805
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:53,443
He will need to speak
to someone in India.

806
01:16:54,300 --> 01:16:55,836
After they are reassured, I'll know...

807
01:16:55,900 --> 01:16:57,504
...whether to handover
the packet or not.

808
01:16:59,534 --> 01:17:04,040
Just...send him to this
hotel tomorrow at 11.

809
01:17:04,434 --> 01:17:05,174
Good bye.

810
01:17:05,234 --> 01:17:06,008
Wait.

811
01:17:08,434 --> 01:17:10,573
I'm heading that way,
I'll drop you.

812
01:17:10,901 --> 01:17:12,107
No, it's alright.

813
01:17:12,334 --> 01:17:16,043
It's not a problem. Come on.
- No, it's okay.

814
01:17:16,100 --> 01:17:17,738
I said it's not a problem.

815
01:17:17,967 --> 01:17:19,469
Come on. Let's go.

816
01:18:09,601 --> 01:18:10,671
Sorry.

817
01:18:24,701 --> 01:18:26,044
Come. I am driving.

818
01:19:21,300 --> 01:19:23,109
What's your name?
- What?

819
01:19:23,867 --> 01:19:26,404
Name?
- Shabana Kaif.

820
01:19:35,167 --> 01:19:36,168
Yes, Rafiq.

821
01:19:36,401 --> 01:19:37,277
What are you doing?

822
01:19:37,367 --> 01:19:40,211
Yeah, it's alright. Bye.

823
01:19:44,334 --> 01:19:45,438
Who was it?

824
01:19:46,634 --> 01:19:48,238
Rafiq, the guy who's come with me.

825
01:19:49,067 --> 01:19:50,637
He's going to the casino.

826
01:19:58,801 --> 01:19:59,779
Shabana.

827
01:20:03,167 --> 01:20:04,510
Iam Abdul Haq.

828
01:20:04,567 --> 01:20:06,012
I will take that packet now.

829
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:09,609
Imperial hotel...will you go?

830
01:20:09,667 --> 01:20:10,771
Bye.

831
01:20:12,734 --> 01:20:14,304
Come on, hurry up.

832
01:20:18,667 --> 01:20:21,011
Taufiq sir always said such
great things about you.

833
01:21:05,300 --> 01:21:06,779
Stop the car on the side.

834
01:21:29,500 --> 01:21:30,774
Thank you Sir.

835
01:21:53,367 --> 01:21:55,210
Sorry.

836
01:22:41,367 --> 01:22:44,371
Take a seat, I'll be right back.

837
01:23:12,167 --> 01:23:14,044
Hello.
- Sir, he came along.

838
01:23:14,100 --> 01:23:15,044
What do I do?

839
01:23:15,134 --> 01:23:16,670
Keep him busy,
I'll be right there.

840
01:23:17,134 --> 01:23:18,169
Okay, sir.

841
01:24:10,367 --> 01:24:12,074
Would you like something,
Abdul sir?

842
01:26:59,467 --> 01:27:00,377
Search him.

843
01:27:00,467 --> 01:27:01,343
Yes?

844
01:27:02,534 --> 01:27:04,241
Hello.
- Yes tell me.

845
01:27:04,700 --> 01:27:05,940
Are you in a conference?

846
01:27:06,734 --> 01:27:07,508
No.

847
01:27:07,834 --> 01:27:10,110
Tomorrow is Ananya's birthday.
Can you make it?

848
01:27:11,734 --> 01:27:12,735
Of course.

849
01:27:13,101 --> 01:27:16,708
Call home and invite
everyone on our behalf.

850
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:17,801
And try to...

851
01:27:17,867 --> 01:27:20,313
Anjali, can I call you back?

852
01:27:22,167 --> 01:27:23,145
Why?

853
01:27:24,100 --> 01:27:25,374
Iam in the middle of something.

854
01:27:26,900 --> 01:27:29,972
I asked you whether
you're busy or not?

855
01:27:30,267 --> 01:27:31,177
Sorry.

856
01:27:32,267 --> 01:27:33,712
That's all you always say.

857
01:27:34,267 --> 01:27:35,610
Call me back once you're free.

858
01:27:36,367 --> 01:27:37,345
Okay, bYe-

859
01:27:44,267 --> 01:27:46,042
All he's got is money,
nothing else.

860
01:27:46,100 --> 01:27:47,135
No cellphone.

861
01:27:47,234 --> 01:27:48,144
Sir, we got him.

862
01:27:48,234 --> 01:27:49,838
We're bringing him back, by road.

863
01:27:49,934 --> 01:27:51,880
Message me the car details.

864
01:27:51,934 --> 01:27:54,505
Indian Air Force will help you
out at the Sanauli border.

865
01:27:54,600 --> 01:27:56,273
Right, sir. Thank you.

866
01:27:56,700 --> 01:27:57,610
Inject him.

867
01:27:57,667 --> 01:27:58,509
Okay sir.

868
01:28:50,234 --> 01:28:51,372

870
01:28:59,200 --> 01:29:00,702
Did you record it
- Yes, sir.

871
01:29:05,834 --> 01:29:06,869
What do you think?

872
01:29:08,667 --> 01:29:09,839
I don't know sir.

873
01:29:11,134 --> 01:29:12,807
We don't have time, Ajay.

874
01:29:14,067 --> 01:29:15,102
<i>L'll try.</i>

875
01:29:16,734 --> 01:29:18,008
Bring me the stuff.

876
01:29:28,034 --> 01:29:29,035

01:29:29,634 --> 01:29:30,510
Rod.

878
01:29:32,067 --> 01:29:32,943
And that?

879
01:29:33,167 --> 01:29:34,111

880
01:29:38,067 --> 01:29:39,205

Ask me.

887
01:29:55,867 --> 01:29:56,868

Look, you don't understand
what I am saying.

01:30:10,201 --> 01:30:11,305
Iam a businessman.

893
01:30:11,667 --> 01:30:12,975

...with this India-Pakistan
or Hindu-Muslim war...

01:30:28,867 --> 01:30:31,074
I only give

899
01:30:31,800 --> 01:30:33,177
And I can be useful
to you in future also.

900

01:30:49,400 --> 01:30:50,708
He's got a big meeting tomorrow.

904
01:30:51,267 --> 01:30:52,871
To finalize the
rest of the planning...

905
01:30:53,167 --> 01:30:54,305
...and also funding.

906
01:30:55,900 --> 01:30:56,935
What are they planning next?

907
01:30:57,301 --> 01:30:59,747
What are your big plans?
- I don't make plans.

908
01:31:00,367 --> 01:31:02,347
They do all that, I am just...

909
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:04,175
A businessman.
- Yes.

910
01:31:04,634 --> 01:31:05,840
What are they thinking?

911
01:31:07,334 --> 01:31:08,540
Have you heard of Jumbo Jet room...

912
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:10,045
...and Nanhe Mujahid?

913
01:31:11,967 --> 01:31:14,470
They will be carrying
out the rest of the plan.

914
01:31:24,034 --> 01:31:25,843
I just wrote it down...

915
01:31:27,767 --> 01:31:28,905
Hold on.

916
01:31:30,834 --> 01:31:32,177
Yes, Mr. Feroz sir.

917
01:31:32,567 --> 01:31:34,376
I need to see sir?

918
01:31:34,967 --> 01:31:36,776
Sir is on a very tight schedule.

919
01:31:36,967 --> 01:31:39,004
I suggest that...
- Mr. Gupta!

920
01:31:40,067 --> 01:31:41,102
Yes.

921
01:31:41,967 --> 01:31:44,140
Come. I'll arrange for it.

922
01:31:45,034 --> 01:31:45,944
Yes.

923
01:31:47,167 --> 01:31:48,271
Mr. Gupta.

924
01:31:55,134 --> 01:31:56,875
I don't know anything more.

925
01:32:05,001 --> 01:32:05,843
Yes.

926
01:32:12,567 --> 01:32:14,046
I told you every1hing.

927
01:32:15,100 --> 01:32:16,306
Why did you hit me?

928
01:32:16,767 --> 01:32:17,745
Out of habit.

929
01:32:41,201 --> 01:32:42,703
Yes, sir.

930
01:32:42,767 --> 01:32:43,837
We have to go with it.

931
01:32:43,900 --> 01:32:44,742
Sir.

932
01:32:45,234 --> 01:32:46,508
I'll call you back.

933
01:32:48,101 --> 01:32:50,377
Afternoon, sir.
- Good afternoon.

934
01:32:50,767 --> 01:32:51,745
Good afternoon sir.

935
01:32:55,200 --> 01:32:57,612
Sir, we've found about Bilal Khan.

936
01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:00,643
And according to me,
the story goes like this...

937
01:33:01,434 --> 01:33:04,005
Indian Mujahideen and Lashkar...

938
01:33:04,067 --> 01:33:05,410
...were jointly planning an attack.

939
01:33:05,767 --> 01:33:07,610
But suddenly Bilal
Khan got apprehended.

940
01:33:08,301 --> 01:33:11,111
Lashkar's leaders still
Wanted to execute the plan.

941
01:33:11,501 --> 01:33:15,108
But IM wanted to
free Bilal Khan first.

942
01:33:15,167 --> 01:33:18,671
So...Wasim mobilizes
funds from Nepal.

943
01:33:19,134 --> 01:33:21,205
Javed comes down to
India from Pakistan.

944
01:33:21,534 --> 01:33:25,448
And with his help,
Bilal Khan escapes.

945
01:33:26,134 --> 01:33:28,011
But the threat still looms, sir.

946
01:33:29,067 --> 01:33:30,774
Now if we want to stop them...

947
01:33:31,234 --> 01:33:33,771
...we'll need to stop Bilal Khan?

948
01:33:34,134 --> 01:33:35,340
What were they planning?

949
01:33:35,434 --> 01:33:36,936
We've intel
that Bilal Khan...

950
01:33:37,601 --> 01:33:40,844
...will activate a unit of
Lashkar's Jumbo Jet Room.

951
01:33:41,134 --> 01:33:42,545
Tell me more of this.

952
01:33:42,767 --> 01:33:46,305
Sir, Jumbo Jet Room is
Lashkar's aerial attack unit...

953
01:33:46,467 --> 01:33:48,003
...and it's based in Karachi.

954
01:33:48,534 --> 01:33:50,480
There are about 150 men in this unit.

955
01:33:50,734 --> 01:33:54,477
Pilots, mercenaries,
para-troopersmand what not.

956
01:33:54,700 --> 01:33:59,547
They can attack in any form right
from 9/11 to fedayeen type attacks.

957
01:34:00,034 --> 01:34:01,206
Ajay, will you?

958
01:34:01,401 --> 01:34:03,381
Sir, our ex-officer Jamal,
warned me...

959
01:34:03,734 --> 01:34:06,578
...that this year there is
going to be lot of fireworks.

960
01:34:07,001 --> 01:34:10,380
Jamad-Ud-Dawa publishes
a fortnightly magazine, for kids.

961
01:34:10,434 --> 01:34:11,412
Nanhe Mujahid.

962
01:34:11,800 --> 01:34:13,245
Pakistan has banned it.

963
01:34:13,900 --> 01:34:16,574
We just learned that Nanhe
Mujahid is being upgraded.

964
01:34:16,900 --> 01:34:18,641
It'll be an independent militant wing.

965
01:34:18,734 --> 01:34:20,372
Sir, Bilal's in Al-Dera right now.

966
01:34:20,567 --> 01:34:22,240
To plan the funding and chock out
the future plans for both the groups.

967
01:34:22,467 --> 01:34:26,176
Then he'll head straight to Karachi
and try to execute his plans.

968
01:34:26,734 --> 01:34:29,146
They'll carry out aerial
attacks on a large scale.

969
01:34:29,234 --> 01:34:31,339
Target in all
probability-Delhi or Mumbai.

970
01:34:31,434 --> 01:34:32,572
Or maybe both.

971
01:34:33,434 --> 01:34:34,412
So now?

972
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:37,547
Sir, we have caught 3 of their
most important men in last 2 days.

973
01:34:37,834 --> 01:34:39,973
We've confirmed intel
about Bilal as well.

974
01:34:40,301 --> 01:34:42,542
If we get Bilal,
then that will be a big blow to them.

975
01:34:43,001 --> 01:34:44,071
Get Bilal means?

976
01:34:44,167 --> 01:34:45,237
Eliminate!

977
01:34:45,700 --> 01:34:49,375
After killing Bilal,
will bring Wasim before the media.

978
01:34:49,667 --> 01:34:51,078
The message will be loud and clear.

979
01:34:51,367 --> 01:34:53,506
That we're not behind them, in fact,
we're two steps ahead of them.

980
01:34:54,101 --> 01:34:55,705
This is a big opportunity, sir.

981
01:34:56,034 --> 01:34:57,274
And I don't think
we should miss it.

982
01:34:58,634 --> 01:35:01,877
Where is Bilal?
- He's in Saudi Al-Dera, sir.

983
01:35:01,934 --> 01:35:02,912
What?

984
01:35:03,800 --> 01:35:05,541
Are you out of your mind, Feroz?

985
01:35:06,200 --> 01:35:08,305
I mean who do you think you are?
The Mossads?

986
01:35:08,667 --> 01:35:10,010
The idea has merit, sir.

987
01:35:10,300 --> 01:35:11,711
First Nepal and now this.

988
01:35:12,034 --> 01:35:14,537
Sir, Nepal was an extremely
successful operation.

989
01:35:14,767 --> 01:35:16,644
But Saudi Al-Dera?

990
01:35:17,234 --> 01:35:18,713
Feroz, you don't need
me to tell you...

991
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:20,711
...that this is a very dumb idea.

992
01:35:20,767 --> 01:35:23,680
It's risky,
sir, but it's not a dumb idea.

993
01:35:24,267 --> 01:35:26,110
We've a deep
asset in Saudi Al-Dera.

994
01:35:26,467 --> 01:35:29,937
And with his help,
this idea is definitely possible.

995
01:35:30,967 --> 01:35:32,412
What are the percentages?

996
01:35:32,467 --> 01:35:33,377
Five percent, sir.

997
01:35:33,434 --> 01:35:34,606
It's a great percentage.

998
01:35:34,701 --> 01:35:36,203
I even go on one percent.

999
01:35:37,401 --> 01:35:39,642
No, Feroz. I cannot sanction this.

1000
01:35:39,734 --> 01:35:40,769
Sir, just like Nepal...

1001
01:35:40,834 --> 01:35:42,438
...this will be a covert
operation, as well.

1002
01:35:43,167 --> 01:35:43,907
Nothing...

1003
01:35:43,967 --> 01:35:45,708
I repeat nothing will be official.

1004
01:35:45,801 --> 01:35:47,178
Even internally.

1005
01:35:48,034 --> 01:35:49,342
If something goes wrong...

1006
01:35:49,434 --> 01:35:52,210
If something happens to Ajay then,
we do not know him.

1007
01:35:54,467 --> 01:35:56,003
Can I talk to you in private?

1008
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:58,070
Excuse me.

1009
01:36:04,334 --> 01:36:07,611
When you keep saying
in front of this officer...

1010
01:36:08,034 --> 01:36:11,481
...that if anything goes wrong,
we will disown him...

1011
01:36:12,201 --> 01:36:13,942
...how much of it do you really mean?

1012
01:36:14,167 --> 01:36:15,441
I mean it fully, sir.

1013
01:36:36,467 --> 01:36:37,537
I am sorry.

1014
01:36:41,234 --> 01:36:46,081
We get some officers like him,
bit crazy...and stubborn.

1015
01:36:47,167 --> 01:36:50,011
And all that they care about
is their nation and patriotism.

1016
01:36:50,734 --> 01:36:52,270
They don't want to
die for their country.

1017
01:36:53,001 --> 01:36:54,207
In fact, they want
to live for the country.

1018
01:36:54,701 --> 01:36:57,614
So that they can protect
it until their last breath.

1019
01:36:59,634 --> 01:37:01,136
And are we doing enough for them?

1020
01:37:03,034 --> 01:37:04,069
No, sir.

1021
01:37:06,367 --> 01:37:07,778
But the fact is...

1022
01:37:08,667 --> 01:37:09,668
...they don't even care.

1023
01:37:19,067 --> 01:37:20,444
How many men do you need?

1024
01:37:20,501 --> 01:37:22,447
One backup and a technician.

1025
01:37:22,834 --> 01:37:23,812
Take Shukla.

1026
01:37:25,134 --> 01:37:26,511
Sir why are you doing this to me?

1027
01:37:33,501 --> 01:37:34,878
How many hours do
you spend in the gym?

1028
01:37:34,967 --> 01:37:36,037
Daily four hours, sir?

1029
01:37:36,701 --> 01:37:38,612
Try you do Sudoku?
- No, sir.

1030
01:37:39,400 --> 01:37:41,038
Try Sudoku for 30 minutes a day.

1031
01:37:44,167 --> 01:37:45,407
I talked to him, sir.

1032
01:37:45,667 --> 01:37:46,873
He said...

1033
01:37:47,067 --> 01:37:48,102
Good evening.
- Mr. Shukla's here.

1034
01:37:48,367 --> 01:37:49,778
Hello sir.
- Good evening, sir.

1035
01:37:50,101 --> 01:37:51,273
Evening, Shukla.

1036
01:37:52,334 --> 01:37:54,245
Sir, I don't want
to work with this man.

1037
01:37:54,801 --> 01:37:56,940
Stop crabbing Shukla.

1038
01:37:57,134 --> 01:37:59,910
No, sir.
I don't want to work with him.

1039
01:38:00,201 --> 01:38:01,578
He always gets me in a tight spot.

1040
01:38:01,967 --> 01:38:03,446
He's a reckless man.

1041
01:38:03,967 --> 01:38:07,039
I barely escaped death
in Bangladesh and Iraq.

1042
01:38:07,134 --> 01:38:08,772
It was me who saved your life.

1043
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:10,343
It was you who
got me in that spot?

1044
01:38:10,767 --> 01:38:12,747
He changes the entire
plan at the last minute.

1045
01:38:12,801 --> 01:38:14,212
And sc*** the entire mission.

1046
01:38:14,367 --> 01:38:15,141
I am sorry, sir.

1047
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:17,477
It's call improvisation,
Mr. Shukla.

1048
01:38:17,734 --> 01:38:18,644
I see.

1049
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:20,172
Fine, I won't do it.

1050
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:22,643
No, sir.
I don't want to work with him.

1051
01:38:23,634 --> 01:38:25,580
Fine, sir.
Jai and I will handle this.

1052
01:38:29,900 --> 01:38:32,972
Tarzan and Hulk will
handle this operation jointly.

1053
01:38:33,267 --> 01:38:34,644
God save the country.

1054
01:38:35,300 --> 01:38:37,473
Enough, Shukla.
- No, sir.

1055
01:38:38,200 --> 01:38:39,736
I don't want to work with him.

1056
01:38:42,401 --> 01:38:45,245
Ladies and gentlemen,
on behalf of the crew...

1057
01:38:45,334 --> 01:38:48,781
...l ask that you please direct
your attention to the monitor above...

1058
01:38:48,867 --> 01:38:51,404
...as we review the
emergency procedures.

1059
01:38:51,467 --> 01:38:54,380
There are six emergency
exits on this aircraft.

1060
01:38:54,700 --> 01:38:57,806
Take a minute to locate
the exit closet to you.

1061
01:39:04,801 --> 01:39:07,611
Our first job
was to provide a cover...

1062
01:39:07,700 --> 01:39:09,111
...and create a
background for our team.

1063
01:39:09,301 --> 01:39:12,441
We floated a Gujarat
based oil company overnight.

1064
01:39:12,767 --> 01:39:14,713
And gave it 15 years of history.

1065
01:39:15,301 --> 01:39:17,178
We even gave a background...

1066
01:39:17,234 --> 01:39:18,577
...to three of
the company's employees.

1067
01:39:19,101 --> 01:39:21,581
Then in afake mail trail...

1068
01:39:21,667 --> 01:39:23,203
...we fixed an
urgent meeting between...

1069
01:39:23,301 --> 01:39:26,282
...our Indian company
and Saudi Al-Dera company.

1070
01:39:26,567 --> 01:39:30,037
The Al-Dera company belonged
to our deep asset, Ashfaq.

1071
01:39:35,534 --> 01:39:37,946
Ashfaq was groomed by Ajay.

1072
01:39:38,367 --> 01:39:40,938
Ashfaq was in
Al-Dera for four years.

1073
01:39:41,800 --> 01:39:44,246
We helped him setup his business.

1074
01:39:44,901 --> 01:39:48,110
Ashfaq's job was to provide
us with local support.

1075
01:39:48,401 --> 01:39:49,971
He was very reliable.

1076
01:39:50,767 --> 01:39:52,337
He had also been
arrested a few times.

1077
01:39:52,500 --> 01:39:55,208
But every time he would
get bail inside of an hour.

1078
01:39:56,067 --> 01:39:57,478
He knew something really bad...

1079
01:39:57,534 --> 01:39:59,480
...about someone really important.

1080
01:40:00,467 --> 01:40:04,210
We knew more about
Al-Dera than America.

1081
01:40:06,201 --> 01:40:07,771
Where is all our stuff?

1082
01:40:08,200 --> 01:40:09,270
It's in the bags.

1083
01:40:09,367 --> 01:40:10,437
Everyihing-

1084
01:40:11,367 --> 01:40:12,437
More than every1hing.

1085
01:40:13,367 --> 01:40:16,109
Bilal's staying in a desert resort.
In the villa section.

1086
01:40:16,501 --> 01:40:17,946
Under the name of Firdaus Ali.

1087
01:40:18,434 --> 01:40:20,778
You're all booked in
room in the other wing.

1088
01:40:20,934 --> 01:40:22,504
The other details are in the bag.

1089
01:40:23,701 --> 01:40:24,975
Just keep looking down.

1090
01:40:25,034 --> 01:40:27,412
And avoid the CCTV camera
as much as you can.

1091
01:41:13,367 --> 01:41:16,246
According to Wasim, Bilal's meeting
was scheduled on the same evening.

1092
01:41:17,101 --> 01:41:21,709
So we decidedmthat they will
kill Bilal the same night...

1093
01:41:21,767 --> 01:41:23,542
...and leave for the
airport immediately.

1094
01:41:24,534 --> 01:41:28,482
Their return flight was scheduled
for next morning, at 5:30 a.m.

1095
01:41:49,400 --> 01:41:50,378
Enjoy sir.
- Thank you.

1096
01:41:50,467 --> 01:41:51,537
Thank you.
- Thank you sir.

1097
01:41:54,934 --> 01:41:55,571
Vijay.
- Than ks.

1098
01:41:55,667 --> 01:41:56,441
Brijmohan.

1099
01:41:56,534 --> 01:41:57,376
Rahul.

1100
01:41:57,767 --> 01:41:58,438
Good luck.

1101
01:42:05,534 --> 01:42:06,205
Here.

1102
01:43:08,334 --> 01:43:09,677
What's the plan, Mr. Shukla?

1103
01:43:11,200 --> 01:43:12,645
Bilal's been given very high security.

1104
01:43:12,967 --> 01:43:15,470
From the main entrance
to the individual villa.

1105
01:43:15,667 --> 01:43:17,476
46&47 is highly guarded.

1106
01:43:17,534 --> 01:43:19,207
It means, whoever Bilal's meeting...

1107
01:43:19,300 --> 01:43:21,007
...is staying in 47.

1108
01:43:21,500 --> 01:43:22,478
It's not allowed.

1109
01:43:22,534 --> 01:43:24,036
Don't take pictures, it's not allowed.

1110
01:43:24,100 --> 01:43:25,670
Okay.
- Not allowed.

1111
01:43:27,234 --> 01:43:29,578
I hacked into the hotel reservations.

1112
01:43:29,667 --> 01:43:32,375
He's meeting someone
by the name of Abbas Sheikh.

1113
01:43:33,367 --> 01:43:34,869
What's the plan, Mr. Shukla?

1114
01:43:35,634 --> 01:43:36,635
Do you have any patience?

1115
01:43:37,734 --> 01:43:39,611
Of course I have patience which is
why you are alive.

1116
01:43:40,967 --> 01:43:41,945
Good.

1117
01:43:42,201 --> 01:43:43,839
We're going to keep
it extremely simple.

1118
01:43:44,267 --> 01:43:45,837
We'll enter from the desert.

1119
01:43:46,234 --> 01:43:48,180
Wasim said that
they're meeting at 8.

1120
01:43:48,501 --> 01:43:50,139
We'll wait for their
meeting to get over.

1121
01:43:50,201 --> 01:43:53,205
And exactly an hour
later...you guys scale this wall...

1122
01:43:53,301 --> 01:43:57,010
...and cross this lawn or terrace,
and enter Bilal's room.

1123
01:43:57,067 --> 01:43:57,875
And kill him.

1124
01:43:57,967 --> 01:44:01,005
Next, you two will come
back the same way you went in.

1125
01:44:01,067 --> 01:44:02,410
We'll head back to the airport,
catch the flight...

1126
01:44:02,534 --> 01:44:03,808
...and head back to India.

1127
01:44:04,767 --> 01:44:07,111
What's the height of this wall?
- 18 feet.

1128
01:44:08,567 --> 01:44:09,568
You'll need to climb it.

1129
01:44:09,667 --> 01:44:11,112
But you guys can manage.

1130
01:44:12,501 --> 01:44:13,605
CCTV?

1131
01:44:14,500 --> 01:44:15,945
Digitalmhackable.

1132
01:44:16,234 --> 01:44:18,475
That's not the problem?
- Then, what's the problem?

1133
01:44:18,967 --> 01:44:19,945
From the desert side...

1134
01:44:20,034 --> 01:44:22,139
...you will first come across
a 9 feet electrical parameter.

1135
01:44:22,534 --> 01:44:23,842
The wall comes 30 feet later.

1136
01:44:24,200 --> 01:44:26,271
I'll give you a three minute window.

1137
01:44:26,334 --> 01:44:27,972
All the CCTV cameras will be off.

1138
01:44:28,500 --> 01:44:30,707
And the power-supply to the
electric fence will be disconnected.

1139
01:44:31,667 --> 01:44:35,877
Mr. Shukla, you want us to
climb a 18 feet wall...

1140
01:44:35,934 --> 01:44:39,882
...and cross the terrace or balcony,
cross the bedroom...

1141
01:44:39,934 --> 01:44:45,475
...find Bilal, kill him and then come
out...cross the balcony or terrace...

1142
01:44:45,567 --> 01:44:47,478
...and jump down a 18
feet wall in three minutes.

1143
01:44:47,901 --> 01:44:49,903
We're not as fit as you are,
Mr. Shukla.

1144
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:53,946
Sarcasm? Huh?

1145
01:44:55,300 --> 01:44:57,007
Fine, I'll give you four.

1146
01:44:58,867 --> 01:45:00,847
We'll check out at 7pm.

1147
01:45:01,834 --> 01:45:02,539
Okay sir.

1148
01:46:49,101 --> 01:46:50,102
Good luck.

1149
01:47:31,567 --> 01:47:32,602
We've reached.

1150
01:47:34,067 --> 01:47:35,774
Good. Now relax.

1151
01:49:09,734 --> 01:49:11,475
Enough already, finish it.

1152
01:49:24,367 --> 01:49:26,176
Are you going to
plan every1hing today?

1153
01:49:26,534 --> 01:49:28,013
You'll be dead soon.

1154
01:49:34,400 --> 01:49:37,438
Friends,
they're sitting down for a meal.

1155
01:50:14,334 --> 01:50:15,574
Now they're going to have tea.

1156
01:50:15,967 --> 01:50:17,537
We've to catch a flight.

1157
01:50:20,667 --> 01:50:21,839
Good evening, sir.

1158
01:50:21,901 --> 01:50:24,211
Any update?
- No, sir. No update yet.

1159
01:50:24,800 --> 01:50:26,245
It's too late,
I think we should abort.

1160
01:50:26,768 --> 01:50:27,872
Patch me.

1161
01:50:30,367 --> 01:50:31,277
What do we do?

1162
01:50:31,367 --> 01:50:33,813
Sir, we'll wait.
- Sir, we'll miss our flight.

1163
01:50:33,901 --> 01:50:35,812
If we stay,
and our cover will be blown.

1164
01:50:35,900 --> 01:50:36,810
Sir, we'll wait.

1165
01:50:36,901 --> 01:50:38,312
Sir, when their
meeting is going to end...

1166
01:50:38,400 --> 01:50:39,936
...when will they
go to sleep, and when?

1167
01:50:40,001 --> 01:50:41,412
We have to do it someplace else, sir.

1168
01:50:41,467 --> 01:50:42,741
Let's wait for a while, sir.

1169
01:50:43,267 --> 01:50:44,302
There he goes again, sir.

1170
01:50:44,400 --> 01:50:46,346
I told you...l mean...

1171
01:50:46,434 --> 01:50:49,313
Shukla, we'll wait
for 10 more minutes.

1172
01:50:49,467 --> 01:50:50,639
Bye.
- Yes sir.

1173
01:50:51,901 --> 01:50:53,938
I knew this would happen.

1174
01:50:54,001 --> 01:50:55,947
Working with you, means sc***

1175
01:51:02,200 --> 01:51:03,304
What happened?

1176
01:51:06,900 --> 01:51:08,004
The meeting's finished.

1177
01:51:08,334 --> 01:51:09,438
We can still do this.

1178
01:51:09,500 --> 01:51:11,275
Mr. Shukla,
we won't wait for them to sleep.

1179
01:51:11,568 --> 01:51:13,946
As soon as Bilal's guests leave,
the room and he's alone...

1180
01:51:14,001 --> 01:51:14,979
...we'll go in.

1181
01:51:15,067 --> 01:51:16,603
No, Ajay. No.

1182
01:51:16,767 --> 01:51:18,804
Ajay please come back.
- Come on.

1183
01:51:19,134 --> 01:51:20,579
Mr. Shukla, we've started walking.

1184
01:51:21,368 --> 01:51:22,506
The rest is in your hands.

1185
01:51:22,601 --> 01:51:24,979
This is exactly why I don't
want to work with him.

1186
01:52:13,334 --> 01:52:14,506
Oh no.

1187
01:52:39,167 --> 01:52:40,407
Someone switched the power back on.

1188
01:52:40,467 --> 01:52:41,912
Don't shut it off now,
they'll get suspicious.

1189
01:55:53,667 --> 01:55:55,408
Sir, it's Maulana..

1190
01:55:56,167 --> 01:55:57,077
Oh no!

1191
01:56:50,634 --> 01:56:52,170
That mean Bilal came
here to meet him.

1192
01:56:53,667 --> 01:56:55,237
Guys, all okay?
- Yeah, okay.

1193
01:56:55,301 --> 01:56:56,473
Job done, we're on our way.

1194
01:56:56,534 --> 01:56:58,172
Good, hurry up.

1195
01:56:59,201 --> 01:57:01,875
Let's take him along.
- But, sir...

1196
01:57:05,800 --> 01:57:07,074
Shall we tell Shukla sir?

1197
01:57:07,634 --> 01:57:08,840
If we tell him,
he will never disconnect...

1198
01:57:08,901 --> 01:57:10,539
...the power-supply
of the electric fence.

1199
01:57:11,067 --> 01:57:12,671
He won't let us out.

1200
01:57:14,334 --> 01:57:15,608
Search him.
- Okay sir.

1201
01:57:18,767 --> 01:57:21,270
You know, I was saying...

1202
01:57:21,367 --> 01:57:22,243
See...

1203
01:57:22,800 --> 01:57:24,279
He's already asleep.

1204
01:57:47,334 --> 01:57:48,836
Disconnect the power.

1205
01:57:50,200 --> 01:57:51,144
Power off.

1206
01:58:47,700 --> 01:58:48,804
Sir, he's gone crazy.

1207
01:58:49,167 --> 01:58:50,805
He found the Maulana,
but didn't kill him.

1208
01:58:51,068 --> 01:58:52,411
In fact, he brought him along.

1209
01:58:52,867 --> 01:58:54,676
And now he's insisting
on bringing him to India.

1210
01:58:54,801 --> 01:58:57,475
Sir, please tell him to
get rid of him and finish this.

1211
01:58:58,034 --> 01:58:59,104
Give the phone to Ajay.

1212
01:58:59,434 --> 01:59:00,242
Okay, sir.

1213
01:59:00,667 --> 01:59:01,873
Shukla.
- Talk to him.

1214
01:59:02,901 --> 01:59:03,743
Sir.

1215
01:59:04,034 --> 01:59:05,877
Are you sure it's him?
- Yes sir.

1216
01:59:07,067 --> 01:59:08,102
What have you thought?

1217
01:59:08,200 --> 01:59:09,804
We could've spent
all our lives, but...

1218
01:59:09,900 --> 01:59:11,379
...never got our hands on him.

1219
01:59:11,434 --> 01:59:12,435
Sir, he knows a lot.

1220
01:59:12,534 --> 01:59:13,569
This is the mother lode.

1221
01:59:13,634 --> 01:59:15,841
We need to get him
to India at any cost.

1222
01:59:16,400 --> 01:59:19,074
But how?
- I don't know, I need some time.

1223
01:59:19,134 --> 01:59:20,579
These two will be leaving as planned.

1224
01:59:20,634 --> 01:59:21,942
I'll contact you again.

1225
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:23,206
But...
- He's right, sir.

1226
01:59:23,301 --> 01:59:24,473
Jai and I are leaving.

1227
01:59:24,534 --> 01:59:26,946
If he wants to stay here with his
new friend, then that's his decision.

1228
01:59:27,334 --> 01:59:30,872
Ajay, if we can get him...

1229
01:59:30,967 --> 01:59:32,173
Sir, I'll try my best.

1230
01:59:32,534 --> 01:59:35,174
This is going to be
our biggest success, Ajay.

1231
01:59:35,234 --> 01:59:36,235
Yes sir.

1232
01:59:36,334 --> 01:59:37,404
Come on, guys, let's go.

1233
01:59:45,067 --> 01:59:46,102
Oh no!

1234
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:26,377
Okay, bYe-

1235
02:00:27,301 --> 02:00:28,507
Sir, I want to stay.

1236
02:00:29,767 --> 02:00:31,075
Jai, just go get lost.

1237
02:00:31,134 --> 02:00:32,636
No, sir. I'll stay.

1238
02:00:33,134 --> 02:00:34,374
Just go.

1239
02:00:35,367 --> 02:00:36,710
He's right for a change.

1240
02:00:37,334 --> 02:00:38,938
Sir, please...l'll stay.

1241
02:00:39,167 --> 02:00:40,737
Jai, just go now.
- No, sir.

1242
02:00:40,800 --> 02:00:41,540
Iam not leaving.

1243
02:00:41,634 --> 02:00:43,170
I'm not leaving alone you like this.

1244
02:00:45,868 --> 02:00:47,347
Look how you spoiled him.

1245
02:00:47,568 --> 02:00:49,070
Now he's going to die here with you.

1246
02:00:51,601 --> 02:00:52,841
You can leave.

1247
02:00:56,234 --> 02:00:58,771
Okay, guys...have fun!

1248
02:01:16,200 --> 02:01:18,339
I said I didn't want to work with you.

1249
02:01:18,734 --> 02:01:20,213
Now I am stuck in this too.

1250
02:01:20,534 --> 02:01:21,740
Why? What's wrong?

1251
02:01:23,601 --> 02:01:25,376
This isn't Hulk and
Tarzan's cup of tea.

1252
02:01:25,734 --> 02:01:27,213
You will need me.

1253
02:01:27,434 --> 02:01:28,412
Let's go.

1254
02:01:53,767 --> 02:01:54,939
Hello.
- Yes Ajay.

1255
02:01:55,767 --> 02:01:57,178
Ashfaq there is a situation.

1256
02:02:52,634 --> 02:02:53,612
F*** man.

1257
02:02:53,967 --> 02:02:55,412
He'll look even poorer.

1258
02:02:55,767 --> 02:02:57,371
He'll look pitiable now.

1259
02:02:58,200 --> 02:03:00,180
Jai, get the razor and get started.
- Okay.

1260
02:03:01,667 --> 02:03:02,805
Any plans, Mr. Shukla?

1261
02:03:03,234 --> 02:03:04,474
Can I get a cup of tea?

1262
02:03:04,901 --> 02:03:05,971
I have a headache.

1263
02:03:06,300 --> 02:03:07,904
And after tea I need to go.

1264
02:03:08,500 --> 02:03:09,911
Do you have a loo or not?

1265
02:03:30,401 --> 02:03:33,382
Greetings, I am from house-keeping.
- Wait.

1266
02:03:34,067 --> 02:03:35,341
Come after half an hour.

1267
02:03:42,967 --> 02:03:45,072
Ashfaq, we'll take
the 6 o'clock flight.

1268
02:03:45,734 --> 02:03:47,077
But how will you get out of here?

1269
02:03:47,567 --> 02:03:48,602
Well...

1270
02:03:49,634 --> 02:03:50,840
Medical tourism.

1271
02:03:51,868 --> 02:03:53,347
Ashfaq, you'll have to come with us.

1272
02:03:53,434 --> 02:03:55,277
We'll need a local resident.

1273
02:03:55,334 --> 02:03:56,642
What's the plan, Mr. Shukla?

1274
02:03:57,100 --> 02:03:58,078
Patience.

1275
02:03:59,300 --> 02:04:02,144
Ashfaq, imagine that you've a uncle.

1276
02:04:02,534 --> 02:04:04,980
And your uncle's been
sick for a long time.

1277
02:04:05,267 --> 02:04:07,110
You applied in
a hospital in Chennai...

1278
02:04:07,201 --> 02:04:08,509
...but your application's in a queue.

1279
02:04:09,134 --> 02:04:11,842
Suddenly your uncle's
condition gets critical today.

1280
02:04:11,901 --> 02:04:14,882
And coincidentallymyou receive
a mail from a Chennai Hospital...

1281
02:04:14,934 --> 02:04:16,106
...that the donor's ready.

1282
02:04:16,201 --> 02:04:19,614
Bring your patient,
we'll give him a last minute entry.

1283
02:04:19,901 --> 02:04:21,346
We will have to cover and create...

1284
02:04:21,400 --> 02:04:22,936
...lot of fake paper trail.

1285
02:04:23,001 --> 02:04:24,309
But that's the only way possible.

1286
02:04:27,400 --> 02:04:28,743
Ashfaq.

1287
02:04:31,367 --> 02:04:32,971
You're really good, man.

1288
02:04:33,167 --> 02:04:35,545
On some days...l'm even better.

1289
02:04:36,601 --> 02:04:37,944
Just one problem.

1290
02:04:38,467 --> 02:04:39,707
My uncle's visa.

1291
02:04:39,800 --> 02:04:40,835
That will be done.

1292
02:04:41,067 --> 02:04:42,546
Mr. Shukla, you don't understand.

1293
02:04:43,200 --> 02:04:44,645
Even if I manage to get a visa...

1294
02:04:44,967 --> 02:04:47,504
...my uncle would need a
health inspection for his visa,

1295
02:04:47,768 --> 02:04:49,247
From the local civic authorities.

1296
02:04:49,867 --> 02:04:51,608
First, the uncle will have
to go through a health inspection.

1297
02:04:51,867 --> 02:04:53,210
The health inspector will examine him.

1298
02:04:53,634 --> 02:04:54,977
Next he'll give his
approval on a form.

1299
02:04:55,301 --> 02:04:56,803
Only then will he get the visa.

1300
02:04:57,267 --> 02:04:59,372
And at the airport,
right from the check-in...

1301
02:04:59,667 --> 02:05:03,809
...to paramedics, this form
will be checked at every point.

1302
02:05:03,901 --> 02:05:05,903
You mean we'll have
to admit him in a hospital.

1303
02:05:05,967 --> 02:05:06,775
Yes.

1304
02:05:07,267 --> 02:05:09,941
But we won't know who they
will be sending from the Civic.

1305
02:05:10,534 --> 02:05:11,444
The embassy can call it
an emergency...

1306
02:05:11,501 --> 02:05:12,809
...and make it a priority case.

1307
02:05:13,100 --> 02:05:15,171
But they cannot control
who comes from the Civic.

1308
02:05:17,001 --> 02:05:20,005
Can your doctor make
a backdated case history?

1309
02:05:20,067 --> 02:05:22,377
Yes. I can manage
the hospital and the doctor.

1310
02:05:22,934 --> 02:05:24,743
Fine, make it fool-proof.

1311
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:25,876
It should be a busy hospital...

1312
02:05:25,967 --> 02:05:27,173
...and make it the corner room.

1313
02:05:27,468 --> 02:05:28,674
We'll handle the rest.

1314
02:05:29,434 --> 02:05:30,538
Are you sure?

1315
02:05:31,067 --> 02:05:33,206
Because If we caught
in his health inspection...

1316
02:05:33,434 --> 02:05:34,879
...then there's a square in Dera.

1317
02:05:35,334 --> 02:05:37,280
People call it the Chop-Chop Square.

1318
02:05:37,967 --> 02:05:39,571
Public executions
are carried out there.

1319
02:05:40,067 --> 02:05:42,604
And we'll be...
- Mr. Shukla, start your work.

1320
02:05:42,701 --> 02:05:44,908
What's this about a Chop-Chop Square?

1321
02:05:44,967 --> 02:05:46,071
Nothing, he'sjustjoking.

1322
02:05:46,300 --> 02:05:48,109
Tell him I don't like such jokes.

1323
02:05:48,734 --> 02:05:49,769
<i>OKZiY-</i>

1324
02:05:50,167 --> 02:05:51,168
Chop-Chop Square.

1325
02:05:51,701 --> 02:05:52,873
I said he'll get me...

1326
02:06:03,234 --> 02:06:04,178
Yes, Shukla.

1327
02:06:04,267 --> 02:06:05,940
Sir, we need visas for India.

1328
02:06:06,567 --> 02:06:08,342
And we'll also require lots of cash.

1329
02:06:08,600 --> 02:06:10,546
I'll text you a name and number.

1330
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:12,308
He'll take care of every1hing.

1331
02:06:12,367 --> 02:06:13,471
No questions asked.

1332
02:06:13,534 --> 02:06:14,604
Okay, sir.

1333
02:06:14,801 --> 02:06:16,109
Good you stayed, Shukla.

1334
02:06:17,234 --> 02:06:18,304
Bye, sir.

1335
02:06:20,667 --> 02:06:23,045
Mr. Mathur, how are you?

1336
02:06:24,734 --> 02:06:25,838
Greetings.
- Greetings.

1337
02:06:25,901 --> 02:06:27,778
Greetings. - Greetings.

1338
02:06:27,867 --> 02:06:29,676
Why isn't Bilal came outside.

1339
02:06:38,534 --> 02:06:39,979
How long since anyone opened the door?

1340
02:06:40,067 --> 02:06:41,944
It's been 8 hours.

1341
02:06:46,900 --> 02:06:48,072
Sir!

1342
02:06:50,300 --> 02:06:51,472
Sir!

1343
02:06:53,501 --> 02:06:54,775
Sir!

1344
02:06:57,068 --> 02:06:58,342
Sir!

1345
02:07:00,001 --> 02:07:01,139
Housekeeping!

1346
02:07:05,334 --> 02:07:06,472
Yes, sir. How may I help you?

1347
02:07:06,534 --> 02:07:07,569
Please unlock the door.

1348
02:07:08,067 --> 02:07:09,137
Sure sir.

1349
02:07:09,734 --> 02:07:10,735
Please.

1350
02:07:12,067 --> 02:07:13,045
Bilal sir.

1351
02:07:15,034 --> 02:07:16,536
Bilal sir, where are you?

1352
02:07:18,867 --> 02:07:20,073
Sir.

1353
02:07:27,334 --> 02:07:28,472
Sir where are you?

1354
02:07:36,367 --> 02:07:37,641
Bilal sir...

1355
02:08:26,567 --> 02:08:29,480
Dear Viewers I'm
at the murder scene...

1356
02:08:29,534 --> 02:08:34,540
...where a male dead body was found...
his age is around 43 years...

1357
02:08:34,601 --> 02:08:37,138
...and his name is
reportedly mentioned...

1358
02:08:37,234 --> 02:08:39,805
...as Bilal Khan,
he was killed by gun shots.

1359
02:08:39,900 --> 02:08:43,814
...no authority has
announced any details regarding.

1360
02:08:43,900 --> 02:08:47,575
...once we get the details
we will let you know.

1361
02:09:27,901 --> 02:09:29,278
All right.
- Thank you.

1362
02:09:29,334 --> 02:09:30,210
Thank you.

1363
02:09:30,267 --> 02:09:31,109
Come.

1364
02:09:32,934 --> 02:09:34,004
Hello, sir.

1365
02:09:34,134 --> 02:09:35,579
Serious medical condition.

1366
02:09:35,634 --> 02:09:37,580
We need to travel to
India for a liver transplant.

1367
02:09:43,167 --> 02:09:44,441
Okay, sit down.

1368
02:10:06,200 --> 02:10:07,304
Greeting sir.

1369
02:10:07,867 --> 02:10:08,937
Come here.

1370
02:10:48,701 --> 02:10:49,611
There's a someone outside who says...

1371
02:10:49,700 --> 02:10:51,680
...that the gentlemen in
the adjoining room is missing.

1372
02:10:51,734 --> 02:10:52,872
This is his passport.

1373
02:10:54,501 --> 02:10:56,674
I want passport copies
of all the guests...

1374
02:10:56,767 --> 02:10:59,543
...who checked-in or checked-out
in the last 48 hours.

1375
02:10:59,634 --> 02:11:02,012
And what is the status
on the CCTV footage?

1376
02:11:02,100 --> 02:11:04,910
The seven cameras stopped
recording yesterday at 8:30.

1377
02:11:07,600 --> 02:11:10,979
He isn't Abbas Sheikh,
nor is he from Kuwait.

1378
02:11:11,900 --> 02:11:13,345
Check our database.

1379
02:11:14,667 --> 02:11:17,978
We had three may be four unwanted
guests here today.

1380
02:11:18,034 --> 02:11:19,012
Sir.
- Sir.

1381
02:11:36,001 --> 02:11:38,106
Be careful...Be careful...

1382
02:11:38,201 --> 02:11:39,077
Ashfaq.

1383
02:11:39,167 --> 02:11:41,238
The inspector's reaching
the hospital at 3 pm.

1384
02:11:41,300 --> 02:11:43,075
And there's bad news.
- What?

1385
02:11:43,534 --> 02:11:45,878
Bilal's murder case is being
investigated by Hani Mohammad.

1386
02:11:46,167 --> 02:11:47,771
He's already asked for
the last 48 hours details of..

1387
02:11:47,834 --> 02:11:50,405
...check-in and check-out
along with passport details.

1388
02:11:50,767 --> 02:11:52,110
And they're also looking at the CCTV.

1389
02:11:52,601 --> 02:11:54,512
I've already misplaced your details.

1390
02:11:54,967 --> 02:11:56,105
But Hani is brilliant.

1391
02:11:56,300 --> 02:11:59,008
If only ours is missing,
we'll be easy suspects.

1392
02:11:59,300 --> 02:12:02,247
Ask your contact to
misplace a few more contacts.

1393
02:12:02,300 --> 02:12:03,472
We need a little time.

1394
02:12:03,534 --> 02:12:06,174
Okay, where are you?
- Exchange point.

1395
02:12:06,500 --> 02:12:08,309
See you at the hospital.
- Okay.

1396
02:12:10,001 --> 02:12:10,672
Yes, Sameer.

1397
02:12:10,734 --> 02:12:12,611
Sir, the Chennai Hospital
website has been hacked.

1398
02:12:12,701 --> 02:12:13,543
We're ready.

1399
02:12:13,601 --> 02:12:15,239
Put a Chennai's
simcard in a cellphone...

1400
02:12:15,334 --> 02:12:16,608
...and keep it ready for use.

1401
02:12:17,167 --> 02:12:18,271
The same number should be mentioned...

1402
02:12:18,367 --> 02:12:19,539
...in the verification mail as well.

1403
02:12:19,834 --> 02:12:22,212
Tap the Chennai Hospital landlines.
- Okay.

1404
02:12:22,267 --> 02:12:23,371
And if there's any call from Saudi...

1405
02:12:23,434 --> 02:12:25,311
...then it should be
diverted to you first.

1406
02:12:25,667 --> 02:12:26,668
Got it, sir.

1407
02:12:27,034 --> 02:12:27,978
You two leave.

1408
02:12:28,034 --> 02:12:29,911
Check-in and handle Chennai and Delhi.

1409
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:31,604
Ashfaq and I will
handle every1hing here.

1410
02:12:31,901 --> 02:12:33,073
We'll meet in the flight.

1411
02:12:33,334 --> 02:12:35,780
Jai, you know what to
do if you two are caught?

1412
02:12:36,101 --> 02:12:37,045
Yes, sir.

1413
02:12:38,368 --> 02:12:39,438
You scared the s” out of me again.

1414
02:12:39,767 --> 02:12:40,973
What's your problem?

1415
02:12:42,201 --> 02:12:43,077
Best of luck.

1416
02:13:19,567 --> 02:13:20,409
Excuse me, sir.

1417
02:13:20,467 --> 02:13:21,741
Maulana Sayed Mohammad Rehman.

1418
02:13:21,801 --> 02:13:24,611
LeT Pakistan. Carries a
bounty of 10 million on his head.

1419
02:13:25,134 --> 02:13:26,135
And the deceased?

1420
02:13:26,367 --> 02:13:27,243
Bilal Khan.

1421
02:13:27,301 --> 02:13:29,907
Belongs to a terrorist
group called IM in India.

1422
02:13:32,434 --> 02:13:34,414
Take out all foreigners from the pile.

1423
02:13:34,901 --> 02:13:37,177
I only want to know about the
Indian and Pakistani guests.

Okay sir.

1425
02:13:49,201 --> 02:13:49,838
Hello Ajay.

1432
02:15:28,700 --> 02:15:29,610
Greetings.
- Hello.

1433
02:15:29,934 --> 02:15:31,641
Hi, I am looking for a patient.
His name's Aarif Sheikh.

1434
02:15:31,734 --> 02:15:32,644
Excuse me, sir.

1435
02:15:33,767 --> 02:15:36,043
Are you looking for Aarif Sheikh?

1436
02:15:36,268 --> 02:15:37,679
He happens to be my uncle.

Hold, Sameer.

We're Indians and
we have a reputation.

1445
02:18:18,267 --> 02:18:20,338
If we send a prompt reply,
they'll get suspicious.

1446
02:18:20,534 --> 02:18:21,274
Wait.

1447

They will issue the visa.

1465
02:20:39,100 --> 02:20:39,578
Okay?

1466
02:20:39,634 --> 02:20:40,704
Thank you very much.

1467
02:20:40,767 --> 02:20:41,336

Let it be.

Call your doctor.

1476
02:21:15,234 --> 02:21:18,147
And my bag's in the van downstairs,
get that. - I'll get it.

1477
02:21:32,700 --> 02:21:33,576
Freeze A7.

1478
02:21:36,700 --> 02:21:38,202
Zoom into the car plate.

1479
02:21:40,400 --> 02:21:41,606
Find me this van.

1480
02:22:11,401 --> 02:22:12,209
Hello.

1481
02:22:12,367 --> 02:22:13,641
Sir, we're leaving for the airport.

02:22:14,200 --> 02:22:15,736
You'll have in-flight support.

1483
02:22:25,401 --> 02:22:27,108
I just wrote it down...

1484
02:22:29,333 --> 02:22:30,243
Hold on.

1485
02:22:32,734 --> 02:22:33,712
Yes, Feroz sir.

1486
02:22:34,033 --> 02:22:35,535
I need to see the Minister.

1487
02:22:36,300 --> 02:22:38,075
It's really impossible today.

1488
02:22:38,434 --> 02:22:39,606
Is it very urgent?

1489
02:22:44,167 --> 02:22:45,237
No, Mr. Gupta.

1490
02:22:45,600 --> 02:22:47,170
Nothing urgent, bye.

1491
02:22:56,467 --> 02:22:58,674
Every1hing okay?

Ajay...

1495
02:23:17,300 --> 02:23:18,506
Are you okay?

1496
02:23:20,600 --> 02:23:22,079
Why? What happened?

1497
02:23:26,234 --> 02:23:27,872
I suddenly felt very scared.

1498
02:23:28,934 --> 02:23:30,743
My heart started racing.

1499
02:23:31,467 --> 02:23:32,810
Are you really okay?

1500
02:23:35,801 --> 02:23:36,541
What will happen to me?

1501
02:23:36,600 --> 02:23:37,772
I am absolutely fine.

1502
02:23:38,567 --> 02:23:39,602
Really?

1503
02:23:40,867 --> 02:23:41,937
Where are the kids?

1504
02:23:43,901 --> 02:23:44,845
At school.

1505
02:23:46,367 --> 02:23:49,007
The conference is about to end,
see you soon.

I'll go to the embassy
and complete the formalities.

1512
02:24:14,300 --> 02:24:15,301
We'll meet there.

Good luck.

Yes, sir.

1565
02:31:55,267 --> 02:31:57,907
There's a local resident,
going for a liver ailment.

1566

Sir, the flight has taken off.

1573
02:33:52,033 --> 02:33:53,910
Maulana's capture was not made public.

1574
02:33:54,934 --> 02:33:57,210
First we found out
every1hing we needed to know.

1575
02:33:58,000 --> 02:33:59,001
6 weeks later

1576
02:33:59,201 --> 02:34:01,875
...when he had nothing
more to tell us...

1577
02:34:02,100 --> 02:34:03,738
...we took him to Srinagar.

1578
02:34:04,400 --> 02:34:06,437
Out there,
the Army treated him the same way...

1579
02:34:07,267 --> 02:34:08,575
...they treat militants.

1580
02:34:16,967 --> 02:34:19,914
Baby...which was just on
a 5 year trial run...

1581
02:34:19,967 --> 02:34:21,241
...was shut down.

1582
02:34:21,734 --> 02:34:24,544
And our elite program
was granted permanent status.

1583
02:34:25,034 --> 02:34:27,708
We now have fresh recruits,
and we're more than ready.

1584
02:34:28,700 --> 02:34:30,646
They keep calling us
something or the other.

1585
02:34:31,267 --> 02:34:33,508
But we love the name...Baby!

1586
02:34:58,034 --> 02:35:03,643
"The moments shiver...
time changes its course."

1587
02:35:04,101 --> 02:35:08,709
"The sun sets...on
the horizon faraway."

1588
02:35:09,233 --> 02:35:14,876
"The moments shiver...time
changes its course."

1589
02:35:15,400 --> 02:35:20,941
"The sun sets...on
the horizon faraway."

1590
02:35:21,267 --> 02:35:26,615
"Silence melt away drop by drop."

1591
02:35:26,900 --> 02:35:31,906
"There are no players left...but
the game still goes on."

1592
02:35:31,967 --> 02:35:34,743
"Faces come and go."

1593
02:35:34,833 --> 02:35:38,440
"But the one that
remains in the memories."

1594
02:35:40,767 --> 02:35:43,077
"Carefree..."

1595
02:35:43,301 --> 02:35:46,407
"One that's carefree."

1596
02:35:46,467 --> 02:35:48,504
"Carefree..."

1597
02:35:48,867 --> 02:35:52,007
"One that's carefree."

1598
02:35:52,067 --> 02:35:53,910
"Carefree..."

1599
02:35:54,567 --> 02:35:57,639
"One that's carefree."

1600
02:36:14,300 --> 02:36:17,042
"Don't trust your eyes."

1601
02:36:17,133 --> 02:36:19,841
"Every sight is an illusion."

1602
02:36:19,934 --> 02:36:22,676
"Those who welcome with open arms."

1603
02:36:22,734 --> 02:36:25,806

"Everyone will be tightlipped...
when the silences speak."

"There's a trap within the trap."

1618
02:37:15,533 --> 02:37:18,207
"A face behind every face."
