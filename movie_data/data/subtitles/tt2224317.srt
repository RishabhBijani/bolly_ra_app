1
00:01:59,986 --> 00:02:02,589
You need to be a little careful.

2
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:04,891
The law will be
enforced any day now...

3
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:09,029
l am not selling my property,
Majumdar

4
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,965
Then form a Trust.

5
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:14,901
Even that takes time.

6
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:17,804
All the other landlords are doing it.

7
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:02,415
Pakhi...

8
00:04:21,328 --> 00:04:22,562
Pakhi...

9
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:25,932
Pakhi...

10
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:31,838
Where were you lost?

11
00:04:31,972 --> 00:04:33,640
How long have you been up?

12
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,043
l have been up for ten minutes,

13
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:40,513
but you were staring into space,

14
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,884
moving the fan like a statue.

15
00:04:45,352 --> 00:04:46,553
How are you feeling now?

16
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:48,221
l am feeling fine, thank you.

17
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:51,891
Did it hurt?

18
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:12,045
Did l ever tell you
the Bheel Raja story?

19
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:13,480
No

20
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,981
A long time ago, there lived the...

21
00:05:15,282 --> 00:05:17,684
mighty Raja of the Bheel tribe.

22
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:21,855
Very powerful.
No one could ever harm him.

23
00:05:22,856 --> 00:05:24,090
Everyone was afraid of him.

24
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:28,695
The English made many
attempts on his life.

25
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:31,331
They cut him with swords,

26
00:05:31,965 --> 00:05:33,667
they slit him with a thousand arrows,

27
00:05:34,034 --> 00:05:35,936
but he just wouldn't die.

28
00:05:36,303 --> 00:05:37,971
Then they heard that the Raja...

29
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:41,741
confined his 'life' in a parrot.

30
00:05:43,143 --> 00:05:45,278
But there were a thousand
parrots in the forest.

31
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:48,548
Which one would it be?

32
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:51,518
Then they sent a spy.

33
00:05:52,886 --> 00:05:54,087
A beautiful one.

34
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:58,758
The Raja fell in love with her.
Married her.

35
00:06:00,327 --> 00:06:06,399
One fine day she found 'the' parrot.

36
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:11,171
She got hold of it and...

37
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:16,142
Then?

38
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:19,679
Then he died.

39
00:06:21,181 --> 00:06:24,718
Pakhi, you are my that parrot.

40
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:28,755
lf anything happens to you...

41
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:43,503
You know,
finally Manikpur has electricity.

42
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:45,939
l see. And how long
is it going to stay?

43
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:47,540
What?

44
00:06:50,644 --> 00:06:53,480
Stick to the left side.

45
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:57,817
Slowly.

46
00:06:58,285 --> 00:07:00,353
We don't want to have an accident.

47
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:03,623
lf we get into an accident
then you were driving.

48
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:05,892
lf not then l was driving.

49
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,563
Watch out!

50
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:14,234
Watch out.

51
00:07:14,868 --> 00:07:15,835
Pakhi.

52
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:20,340
You will get me fired.

53
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:22,976
Watch out

54
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:25,979
Watch out

55
00:07:27,247 --> 00:07:29,449
That motor...

56
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:34,681
What are you doing?

57
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:35,315
Shh...

58
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:37,350
Doctor Uncle

59
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:41,054
Pakhi, you can go home.

60
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,323
He's alright. He'll be okay.

61
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:44,958
Ok

62
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:55,936
Move.

63
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:57,137
Why?

64
00:08:58,672 --> 00:09:01,141
You almost killed
the poor motorcyclist.

65
00:09:01,675 --> 00:09:03,977
You don't know how to drive.

66
00:09:04,945 --> 00:09:06,046
Me?

67
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,982
Then who? Me?

68
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:13,253
Come.

69
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:22,362
''The springs came and went.''

70
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:31,204
''But l didn't experience
a single one.''

71
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:39,913
''My heart was drenched this time.''

72
00:09:40,981 --> 00:09:47,988
''l wonder what you did?''

73
00:09:51,191 --> 00:09:52,859
What's wrong?

74
00:09:53,226 --> 00:09:57,130
The filament got damaged.

75
00:09:57,397 --> 00:09:58,398
Filament?

76
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:02,202
The thing that lights up.

77
00:10:02,369 --> 00:10:04,104
lsn't that electricity?

78
00:10:04,404 --> 00:10:08,341
The electricity lights the filament,
the filament lights up the bulb.

79
00:10:08,642 --> 00:10:11,044
Oh, yes. l knew that.

80
00:10:11,645 --> 00:10:14,881
So whatever it is,
lnstall it everywhere.

81
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:17,951
And give the bills to Majumdar.

82
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:22,122
You aren't being serious.

83
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:25,592
lf the Zamindari
Abolishment Act is passed..

84
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:29,296
..you will be left with nothing.

85
00:10:29,496 --> 00:10:32,499
The Act won't be passed, Majumdar.

86
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:33,500
lt will.

87
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,735
There aren't any landlords
in government who will support you.

88
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:38,738
Why do our fathers keep arguing?

89
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,109
My father feels that Zamindar
uncle doesn't understand him

90
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:46,546
and Zamindar uncle feels
that my father keeps yakking.

91
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:49,082
l see. Yakking?

92
00:11:06,967 --> 00:11:07,834
Yes?

93
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:09,336
My name is Varun Srivastava

94
00:11:09,703 --> 00:11:11,071
Where have you come from?

95
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:14,174
You stay here.

96
00:11:20,947 --> 00:11:25,885
Babu, someone has come from Delhi.

97
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:27,053
From where?

98
00:11:27,254 --> 00:11:28,855
Some 'English' place.

99
00:11:34,561 --> 00:11:36,363
He is an archeologist.

100
00:11:36,963 --> 00:11:40,400
Wants to excavate our temple site

101
00:11:40,934 --> 00:11:45,305
He thinks there is an ancient
civilization buried underneath.

102
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,141
So?

103
00:11:48,275 --> 00:11:49,876
He's coming home for dinner tonight

104
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:52,145
Ask him yourself.

105
00:12:01,121 --> 00:12:02,088
Varun Shrivastava.

106
00:12:02,289 --> 00:12:02,722
Yes?

107
00:12:02,856 --> 00:12:04,090
Don't look back

108
00:12:05,158 --> 00:12:07,027
The driver who drove into you,

109
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:09,396
his name is Babu Singh.

110
00:12:12,766 --> 00:12:13,733
Ok.

111
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:16,169
And what is your name?

112
00:12:16,303 --> 00:12:19,973
Don't try to be smart,
because you are not.

113
00:12:21,608 --> 00:12:22,475
Ok.

114
00:12:23,877 --> 00:12:25,879
Which one are you?

115
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:28,148
Mr. Srivastava

116
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:28,882
Yes?

117
00:12:28,982 --> 00:12:30,984
You are very punctual

118
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:33,486
This is my daughter, Pakhi

119
00:12:33,987 --> 00:12:38,224
And Pakhi, he is that
gentleman l told you about.

120
00:12:38,658 --> 00:12:39,559
Hello.

121
00:12:39,693 --> 00:12:41,561
Hello.

122
00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:44,297
She wants to be a writer

123
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:47,200
She's not bad.

124
00:12:47,901 --> 00:12:51,204
She has written her
name on all my books.

125
00:12:52,572 --> 00:12:54,975
Baba, l am good.

126
00:12:55,842 --> 00:12:57,277
l am sure

127
00:12:57,577 --> 00:12:59,145
So, Archaeologists.

128
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:04,551
l always thought they were old men.

129
00:13:05,185 --> 00:13:11,124
Busy amidst the cobwebs
of archaic buildings.

130
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:15,362
l guess that's why the
name starts with 'Archaic'

131
00:13:16,363 --> 00:13:17,330
Of course.

132
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:20,200
Where are you staying?

133
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:24,070
At the Circuit House.
Nearby the temple.

134
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:26,940
What happened to your head?

135
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:29,910
My motorcycle had
an accident with a car.

136
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:31,177
ln Manekpur?

137
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:31,978
Yes.

138
00:13:32,412 --> 00:13:33,580
Who was driving?

139
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,148
l was driving.

140
00:13:35,415 --> 00:13:37,784
lf you drive both of
them at the same time...

141
00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:40,687
l was driving the motorcycle.

142
00:13:40,887 --> 00:13:41,554
Of course.

143
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:42,589
Coffee?

144
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:44,124
Yes

145
00:13:45,392 --> 00:13:47,661
And some bad amateur
was driving the car.

146
00:13:48,428 --> 00:13:52,599
Couldn't spot a motorcycle
on such a wide road

147
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:56,570
l don't think these amateurs
should be allowed...

148
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,339
Sorry. l'll get some cold water.

149
00:14:01,474 --> 00:14:02,542
Sorry about that

150
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:11,952
Even the villagers here are
quite used to her driving lessons.

151
00:14:12,152 --> 00:14:13,486
But...

152
00:14:21,661 --> 00:14:24,798
For days together,
the kitchen remained silent

153
00:14:25,398 --> 00:14:29,102
For days together,
the blind dog slept hungry

154
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:32,639
For days together the
lizards crawled on the walls.

155
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:36,543
For days together, even
the rats were brought to the brink

156
00:14:36,743 --> 00:14:40,146
Food came home, after days together

157
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:43,984
Smoke filled the courtyard
after days together

158
00:14:44,184 --> 00:14:47,554
Rooms sparkled again,
after days together

159
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:51,424
The crow spread his wings,
after days together

160
00:14:52,859 --> 00:14:53,893
Baba Nagarjuna.

161
00:14:54,661 --> 00:14:56,563
Real name Vaidyanath Mishra

162
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:59,332
Lives in Darbhanga,
my native village.

163
00:15:00,033 --> 00:15:02,969
Where did you say, you are staying?

164
00:15:36,002 --> 00:15:38,471
l'm impressed, Varun Babu.

165
00:15:39,906 --> 00:15:42,943
This mansion instead
of that guest house.

166
00:16:01,728 --> 00:16:03,863
Are you understanding anything,
Debdas Mukherjee?

167
00:16:03,997 --> 00:16:05,165
l can understand everything.

168
00:16:06,066 --> 00:16:08,034
My parents talk exactly like this.

169
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:22,582
Learn Bengali

170
00:16:24,417 --> 00:16:26,286
You'll have to learn one day

171
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,254
Have you seen Baazi?

172
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:02,255
No

173
00:17:02,455 --> 00:17:03,556
You should watch it.

174
00:17:03,757 --> 00:17:05,358
Now that's what you call a movie.

175
00:17:06,126 --> 00:17:08,762
Dev Anand plays a gambler.

176
00:17:09,229 --> 00:17:11,131
And a moment comes
when he has to choose.

177
00:17:11,431 --> 00:17:13,133
a hell lot of money
or his sister's life.

178
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,635
Or he has to quit everything,
for his love.

179
00:17:17,337 --> 00:17:18,505
He's an amazing actor.

180
00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:21,141
And an even better fighter.

181
00:17:21,508 --> 00:17:23,109
You want to see how he fights?

182
00:17:23,443 --> 00:17:24,744
Like this, while swaying...

183
00:17:25,278 --> 00:17:27,847
No matter how many goons attack him

184
00:17:28,014 --> 00:17:30,250
they will not spoil his hairstyle.

185
00:17:31,651 --> 00:17:35,589
''Why are you scared of the world?''

186
00:17:36,089 --> 00:17:38,692
This temple's 500 years old.

187
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:43,229
Nobody is allowed to build
or demolish anything here.

188
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:45,465
This famous Radha-Krishna..

189
00:17:45,999 --> 00:17:48,368
..idol is the legacy
of my Roy Chouhdry ancestry.

190
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:50,837
lt's at least three
hundred years old.

191
00:17:55,275 --> 00:17:56,209
This...

192
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:58,578
This is where we start excavating.

193
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:01,781
And we can put up the camp here.

194
00:18:02,182 --> 00:18:04,317
We would need some labourers.

195
00:18:04,851 --> 00:18:05,252
Definitely

196
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:08,455
So this is where we dig

197
00:18:08,989 --> 00:18:09,656
Do what?

198
00:18:09,689 --> 00:18:10,457
Digging

199
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,424
Good

200
00:18:11,825 --> 00:18:15,428
Now, do you guys know how to dig?

201
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:18,131
Sir.

202
00:18:18,465 --> 00:18:21,868
What have we got all this for?

203
00:18:22,669 --> 00:18:23,136
Very good

204
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,671
But why are we going to dig?

205
00:18:26,072 --> 00:18:28,275
Well...because this is land and...

206
00:18:30,043 --> 00:18:35,181
''Try your luck.''

207
00:18:40,553 --> 00:18:41,621
Pull more.

208
00:18:41,755 --> 00:18:44,291
Go further back

209
00:18:57,170 --> 00:19:01,741
''So what if the oars
of your boat are broken.''

210
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:10,150
''Use your arms as the oars.''

211
00:19:10,784 --> 00:19:13,119
''Use your arms as the oars.''

212
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:16,723
''lf you trust yourself,
try your luck.''

213
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:19,292
''Try your luck.''

214
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:23,630
''Take a chance and mend your fate.''

215
00:19:24,564 --> 00:19:28,602
''lf you trust yourself,
try your luck.''

216
00:19:28,735 --> 00:19:31,404
''Try your luck.''

217
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:39,613
News from the capital.

218
00:19:40,146 --> 00:19:42,515
ln a historic decision
today the government of lndia..

219
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:44,818
..announced the
Zamindari Abolition Act.

220
00:19:45,385 --> 00:19:47,254
One of the prominent
lawyers from the High Court..

221
00:19:47,254 --> 00:19:50,056
..Mr. Rao added that
according to this Act...

222
00:19:50,056 --> 00:19:54,527
the Landlords will be allowed no more
than fifteen acres for themselves.

223
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:57,931
Many landlords from
Uttar Pradesh and Bengal..

224
00:19:58,064 --> 00:19:59,866
Will they seize the orchard?

225
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:01,668
Yes.

226
00:20:03,103 --> 00:20:04,938
what will they do with it?

227
00:20:07,574 --> 00:20:09,009
Divide it amongst the villagers...

228
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:12,612
Free fruits for all.

229
00:20:14,447 --> 00:20:20,487
My stomach is growling.

230
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:24,524
No one eats before
the first fish is caught.

231
00:20:25,492 --> 00:20:26,693
Tradition, you see.

232
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:28,628
Of course. - Of course.

233
00:20:42,442 --> 00:20:43,343
Varun Babu.

234
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:50,450
You are looking in the
wrong direction, Varun babu.

235
00:20:51,585 --> 00:20:52,786
Are you mad?

236
00:20:53,219 --> 00:20:54,854
l was just looking.

237
00:20:55,121 --> 00:20:57,290
l saw how you were 'looking'

238
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:58,258
How was l looking?

239
00:20:58,391 --> 00:21:00,860
lt's that 'look'

240
00:21:01,394 --> 00:21:03,997
Things happen.

241
00:21:04,097 --> 00:21:05,131
Nothing happens

242
00:21:05,298 --> 00:21:07,701
your hunger has gone to the brain.

243
00:21:07,801 --> 00:21:09,035
Why are you getting upset?

244
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:13,440
l am just adding to the stuff
you are already cooking up...

245
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,275
l am not cooking up anything.

246
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:08,094
You are not cut out
for this painting stuff?

247
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:12,832
Neither are you Raja, nor Ravi Varma.

248
00:22:13,934 --> 00:22:16,403
You carry that blank
canvas everywhere.

249
00:22:16,403 --> 00:22:17,671
But you never put any paint on it.

250
00:22:19,539 --> 00:22:21,107
My dear friend, Debdas

251
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:25,145
One day l will paint my masterpiece.

252
00:22:26,413 --> 00:22:29,616
And the world will watch.

253
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:36,056
l want to learn painting.

254
00:22:37,757 --> 00:22:40,060
Why the sudden interest?

255
00:22:40,927 --> 00:22:42,095
lts not sudden.

256
00:22:42,295 --> 00:22:43,763
l've always been interested.

257
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:46,333
You keep talking about.

258
00:22:47,067 --> 00:22:48,935
l've always told you,
l wanted to learn

259
00:22:51,204 --> 00:22:52,339
You never told me.

260
00:22:52,439 --> 00:22:55,475
l did You never listen to me.

261
00:22:55,709 --> 00:22:58,912
Fine. Ask Majumdar Babu,
he'll get someone

262
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,615
Ask Devyani also

263
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:04,784
Devyani only wants to cook.

264
00:23:06,086 --> 00:23:08,655
And there's no need
to look for anyone.

265
00:23:09,389 --> 00:23:12,259
Varun Babu is a great painter

266
00:23:25,205 --> 00:23:27,007
Finish your tea.

267
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:04,210
How do l look?

268
00:24:04,411 --> 00:24:06,012
Very beautiful. Now go.

269
00:24:12,285 --> 00:24:13,420
Now what?

270
00:24:16,823 --> 00:24:18,258
Just go

271
00:24:37,277 --> 00:24:38,979
Have you tried to paint before?

272
00:24:40,747 --> 00:24:44,317
l mean, when you used
to study in Shantiniketan.

273
00:24:45,652 --> 00:24:48,188
You know that l used
to study in Shantiniketan?

274
00:24:49,956 --> 00:24:53,693
No. As in since you
are the Zamindar's daughter.

275
00:24:56,963 --> 00:24:58,898
l learnt a little.

276
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:01,868
So what do you want
to learn from me?

277
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:04,871
You tell me.

278
00:25:09,876 --> 00:25:11,978
Lets begin with landscapes.

279
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:16,349
They are easy to grasp.

280
00:25:16,716 --> 00:25:17,984
Then once you get a hang of it...

281
00:25:17,984 --> 00:25:20,387
No. After mangoes and apples,

282
00:25:20,453 --> 00:25:23,123
the first thing they
taught us was Landscapes.

283
00:25:25,558 --> 00:25:28,428
Can't we learn portraits?

284
00:25:31,097 --> 00:25:33,733
You don't think l know
how to paint a landscape?

285
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,335
Shall l show you?

286
00:26:02,295 --> 00:26:06,433
You know how to paint.

287
00:26:06,533 --> 00:26:11,438
l don't know how to paint leaves.

288
00:26:13,373 --> 00:26:14,474
Leaves!

289
00:26:16,142 --> 00:26:17,944
They are really easy

290
00:26:18,945 --> 00:26:20,113
Show me.

291
00:26:23,016 --> 00:26:23,984
Sure

292
00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:47,374
Take some green

293
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:58,618
Take some black

294
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:11,264
What is this?

295
00:27:13,833 --> 00:27:14,501
Leaves

296
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:18,138
This?

297
00:27:22,943 --> 00:27:24,911
lts Modern Art.

298
00:27:31,618 --> 00:27:33,420
You don't know how to paint, do you?

299
00:27:42,629 --> 00:27:44,331
So you are a teacher to him?

300
00:27:44,431 --> 00:27:49,636
For the class to run,
someone has to be a teacher

301
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:54,274
Someone is too smart
for his own good.

302
00:27:55,108 --> 00:27:57,377
l always wanted to learn painting.

303
00:27:57,944 --> 00:27:58,945
And this is a good opportunity. No?

304
00:27:58,945 --> 00:27:59,980
Of course.

305
00:28:04,284 --> 00:28:08,221
''The breeze is against the ambiance.''

306
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:12,492
''Because the bees stole
the nectar from the buds.''

307
00:28:12,792 --> 00:28:17,097
''Life feels different today.''

308
00:28:17,163 --> 00:28:21,334
''So, why don't l
take this chance and..''

309
00:28:21,468 --> 00:28:25,438
''Mend the condition of my heart.''

310
00:28:25,739 --> 00:28:30,010
''Mend the condition of my heart.''

311
00:28:36,316 --> 00:28:40,253
''The breeze is against the ambiance.''

312
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,691
''Because the bees stole
the nectar from the buds.''

313
00:28:44,958 --> 00:28:48,995
''Life feels different today.''

314
00:28:49,162 --> 00:28:53,066
''So, why don't l
take this chance and..''

315
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:57,604
''Mend the condition of my heart.''

316
00:28:57,704 --> 00:29:01,808
''Mend the condition of my heart.''

317
00:29:42,816 --> 00:29:46,519
''The courtyard's filled
with a new ray of light.''

318
00:29:47,087 --> 00:29:51,157
''Who's knocking on my heart?''

319
00:29:51,358 --> 00:29:55,362
''How can l say..''

320
00:29:55,362 --> 00:29:58,765
''..who's been doing
mischief secretly?''

321
00:29:59,866 --> 00:30:03,937
''Mend the condition of my heart.''

322
00:30:04,271 --> 00:30:08,008
''Mend the condition of my heart.''

323
00:30:14,915 --> 00:30:18,852
''The breeze is against the ambiance.''

324
00:30:19,152 --> 00:30:23,123
''Because the bees stole
the nectar from the buds.''

325
00:30:23,356 --> 00:30:27,661
''Life feels different today.''

326
00:30:27,794 --> 00:30:32,065
''So, why don't l
take this chance and..''

327
00:30:49,015 --> 00:30:51,117
My father calls me Pakhi Express

328
00:30:52,252 --> 00:30:54,621
Because l'm always in a hurry

329
00:30:55,689 --> 00:30:57,190
What do you want to do?

330
00:30:57,524 --> 00:30:59,059
l want to write.

331
00:30:59,826 --> 00:31:02,128
Lots and lots of books.

332
00:31:03,763 --> 00:31:05,231
Sometimes, l feel like running away

333
00:31:05,231 --> 00:31:06,199
to our house in Dalhousie.

334
00:31:06,199 --> 00:31:08,201
And just keep writing there.

335
00:31:09,202 --> 00:31:10,704
While the snow keeps falling outside,

336
00:31:10,904 --> 00:31:13,406
lnside l keep writing...
- Writing and more writing..

337
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:18,745
The Raja there has a big palace.

338
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:21,514
Jandhrighat palace.

339
00:31:22,249 --> 00:31:26,253
That Raja is very rich.
Much more than my father.

340
00:31:27,654 --> 00:31:30,890
And he also has an ancient
unique Ganesha idol

341
00:31:31,224 --> 00:31:32,125
ls it?

342
00:31:32,459 --> 00:31:36,196
Made of pure gold.
At least five hundred years old.

343
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:44,371
Do you like what you do?

344
00:31:47,641 --> 00:31:49,476
This is all l know.

345
00:31:58,385 --> 00:32:01,521
l've never known
anything other than this.

346
00:32:02,889 --> 00:32:05,558
lf you get a chance
to do something else,

347
00:32:06,059 --> 00:32:07,961
What would you do?

348
00:32:11,464 --> 00:32:12,499
Tell me...

349

Where is that?

351
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,181
Beyond Manali.

352
00:32:30,417 --> 00:32:31,718
Deep in the Himalayas

353
00:32:34,654 --> 00:32:35,956
Clear blue waters,

354
00:32:38,558 --> 00:32:40,060
And not a sound.

355
00:32:45,031 --> 00:32:46,399
None at all?

356
00:32:51,938 --> 00:32:52,939
No

357
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,008
And?

359
00:32:57,644 --> 00:32:59,613
that the world will remember.

360
00:33:00,413 --> 00:33:01,448
Really?

361
00:33:02,315 --> 00:33:03,917
Yes. Don't tell anyone.

362
00:33:05,085 --> 00:33:06,886
And if l tell?

363
00:34:36,476 --> 00:34:37,844
lt's a flat tyre.

364
00:34:38,044 --> 00:34:39,613
Will take sometime.

365
00:34:58,298 --> 00:34:59,466
What happened?

366
00:35:01,735 --> 00:35:02,669
Pakhi?

367
00:35:34,267 --> 00:35:35,569
Why didn't you tell me?

368
00:37:26,379 --> 00:37:30,750
''Flying away on paper wings''

369
00:37:30,984 --> 00:37:35,755
''lt's heading where it shouldn't.''

370
00:37:35,956 --> 00:37:40,660
''lt can't understand
the delicate heart.''

371
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:45,098
''Because it's under an illusion.''

372
00:37:45,298 --> 00:37:48,902
''Doesn't see,
think, or know...restrictions.''

373
00:37:49,135 --> 00:37:53,940
''Lost its way,
what a fool the heart is.''

374
00:38:02,315 --> 00:38:06,620
''Flying away on paper wings''

375
00:38:06,987 --> 00:38:11,791
''lt's heading where it shouldn't.''

376
00:38:13,126 --> 00:38:14,394
Pakhi is a good girl.

377
00:38:14,761 --> 00:38:16,763
''Because it's under an illusion.''

378
00:38:17,297 --> 00:38:19,432
And you will have to break her heart

379
00:38:19,432 --> 00:38:21,034
''Doesn't see,
think, or know...restrictions.''

380
00:38:21,301 --> 00:38:23,837
''Lost its way,
what a fool the heart is.''

381
00:38:23,837 --> 00:38:27,507
She will be shattered when you leave.

382
00:38:27,908 --> 00:38:30,176
''Lost its way,
what a fool the heart is.''

383
00:38:30,377 --> 00:38:33,313
And if l say that l love her?

384
00:38:35,148 --> 00:38:39,953
You aren't allowed to love,
Mr. Srivastava

385
00:38:41,154 --> 00:38:43,957
lf you want to love,
you need permission.

386
00:38:45,792 --> 00:38:48,228
And that stone-hearted
uncle won't give it to you.

387
00:38:50,163 --> 00:38:55,001
''lt can conquer all forts,
break through walls.''

388
00:38:55,502 --> 00:38:58,405
''Love's a beautiful thing.''

389
00:38:59,773 --> 00:39:03,510
''lt tosses the heart
around now and then.''

390
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:07,948
''The heart feels more like a ball.''

391
00:39:09,349 --> 00:39:12,352
''lt accepts every
grief with a smile.''

392
00:39:12,352 --> 00:39:16,890
''Because it's under an illusion.''

393
00:39:18,959 --> 00:39:22,562
''Doesn't see,
think, or know...restrictions.''

394
00:39:22,596 --> 00:39:27,133
''Lost its way,
what a fool the heart is.''

395
00:39:44,517 --> 00:39:51,258
Start digging in the
opposite direction first.

396
00:39:52,525 --> 00:39:55,195
Start here first

397
00:40:01,401 --> 00:40:02,202
Madam

398
00:40:05,639 --> 00:40:06,239
Let's go.

399
00:40:28,261 --> 00:40:29,195
Varun Babu

400
00:40:30,664 --> 00:40:32,032
No class today?

401
00:40:34,668 --> 00:40:37,003
Yes. Our work is about to finish.

402
00:40:37,003 --> 00:40:38,638
There isn't enough time.

403
00:40:39,673 --> 00:40:41,041
We can learn here also.

404
00:40:42,842 --> 00:40:44,911
No. Not here.

405
00:40:48,682 --> 00:40:49,583
No problem.

406
00:40:50,116 --> 00:40:51,251
Tomorrow?

407
00:40:52,352 --> 00:40:53,420
Tomorrow?

408
00:40:55,722 --> 00:40:56,289
No.

409
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:04,898
The day after tomorrow?

410
00:41:09,469 --> 00:41:10,737
The day after that?

411
00:41:13,707 --> 00:41:15,308
Next week?

412
00:41:17,644 --> 00:41:19,613
l leave next week.

413
00:41:25,952 --> 00:41:28,722
There's a lot of pending work here.

414
00:41:28,788 --> 00:41:30,257
Everyone's waiting for me.

415
00:41:32,993 --> 00:41:34,361
So am l

416
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:45,705
lt would be better if you leave.

417
00:41:52,979 --> 00:41:54,781
lt would be best, if you die

418
00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:20,206
They can dig two
feet more by morning.

419
00:42:21,975 --> 00:42:23,843
That's not great,
when will the other work happen?

420
00:42:26,613 --> 00:42:28,048
Why are you doing this to me?

421
00:42:42,629 --> 00:42:44,331
Come on get back to work.

422
00:42:48,234 --> 00:42:49,336
What's the matter with you today?

423
00:42:49,402 --> 00:42:52,038
With me? What's the matter with you?

424
00:42:53,106 --> 00:42:54,774
Why are you doing this to me?

425
00:42:55,141 --> 00:42:56,910
lt's like you don't want to see me.

426
00:42:57,077 --> 00:42:58,378
Like l'm nothing to you.

427
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:05,318
Do l mean anything to you?

428
00:43:07,087 --> 00:43:08,922
l leave next Tuesday.

429
00:43:10,890 --> 00:43:13,193
And, the time that
we spent together?

430
00:43:14,327 --> 00:43:16,129
You wanted to learn painting

431
00:43:16,162 --> 00:43:20,066
And you didn't know how to!

432
00:43:20,834 --> 00:43:21,701
Why did you agree?

433
00:43:21,768 --> 00:43:22,535
You could have said No then.

434
00:43:22,535 --> 00:43:23,937
l was stupid.

435
00:43:35,115 --> 00:43:36,850
Do you love me, Varun Babu?

436
00:43:45,825 --> 00:43:48,261
Please say yes.

437
00:44:22,862 --> 00:44:26,766
Don't think so much.
you did the right thing.

438
00:44:28,301 --> 00:44:31,404
No need to be my guardian angel.

439
00:44:32,973 --> 00:44:34,040
Eat your food

440
00:44:37,777 --> 00:44:38,912
Uncle sent a telegram asking

441
00:44:39,846 --> 00:44:41,381
why is it taking so much time?

442
00:44:50,690 --> 00:44:51,658
Hello.

443
00:44:52,692 --> 00:44:54,894
Biswajeet Roy, Treasury Department.

444
00:44:55,929 --> 00:44:57,397
What department is this?

445
00:44:57,731 --> 00:45:00,767
There is an official
seal on the letter.

446
00:45:28,728 --> 00:45:29,896
This is ..

447
00:45:30,163 --> 00:45:33,934
The East lndia Company
gifted that to my grandfather.

448
00:45:34,901 --> 00:45:36,736
lt's at least two hundred years old.

449
00:45:37,170 --> 00:45:38,605
Even more

450
00:45:40,006 --> 00:45:41,141
Pal Babu - Yes.

451
00:45:41,341 --> 00:45:42,576
Put all of these into our van

452
00:45:43,476 --> 00:45:44,911
What are you doing?

453
00:45:44,911 --> 00:45:46,646
All of this is lndia's heritage

454
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:49,449
lt will go to the National Treasury
and then maybe to the Museum.

455
00:45:49,449 --> 00:45:52,185
This is my family heritage.
You can't take it.

456
00:45:52,185 --> 00:45:56,256
Whatever the East lndia
Company gave you was not theirs.

457
00:45:57,657 --> 00:45:59,492
lt was all stolen.

458
00:45:59,559 --> 00:46:01,928
lf you wont co-operate,
then we will have to arrest you.

459
00:46:01,962 --> 00:46:04,164
Arrest me?

460
00:46:04,764 --> 00:46:07,667
ln Manekpur? ln my own village?

461
00:46:07,934 --> 00:46:08,902
Pardon me

462
00:46:09,035 --> 00:46:11,905
l'm a government servant not yours.

463
00:46:19,879 --> 00:46:20,847
Goodbye.

464
00:46:24,284 --> 00:46:26,253
The world has changed Varun Babu

465
00:46:28,255 --> 00:46:33,593
lt's improved for you.
and ended for us.

466
00:46:35,862 --> 00:46:38,798
l was so used to this way of life.

467
00:46:39,399 --> 00:46:43,003
that even after you
and Majumdar warned me

468
00:46:44,337 --> 00:46:46,373
l didn't think l
would lose everything

469
00:46:47,641 --> 00:46:51,344
The country got free
from British yoke...

470
00:46:53,079 --> 00:46:55,215
but that freedom cost us dearly.

471
00:47:04,157 --> 00:47:08,995
You still own a lot of
assets that are very valuable.

472
00:47:09,429 --> 00:47:11,731
There are a lot of buyers out there

473
00:47:13,066 --> 00:47:14,634
l can help you?

474
00:47:21,675 --> 00:47:23,944
The government wants to destroy us.

475
00:47:24,945 --> 00:47:27,547
They think we were
friends with the English

476
00:47:29,316 --> 00:47:30,617
But our hands were tied

477
00:47:31,351 --> 00:47:33,620
We gave money to
the lndian National Army

478
00:47:34,454 --> 00:47:39,392
Was it our fault if the Government
didn't accept their fight to freedom?

479
00:47:47,033 --> 00:47:48,001
Varun Babu...

480
00:47:50,570 --> 00:47:51,471
Call them.

481
00:47:54,474 --> 00:47:56,176
Sell everything.

482
00:48:10,357 --> 00:48:11,358
Get up.

483
00:48:13,059 --> 00:48:14,027
Get up.

484
00:48:19,032 --> 00:48:20,567
Put that away

485
00:48:23,870 --> 00:48:25,238
Did you hit me?

486
00:48:25,438 --> 00:48:27,207
The Zamindar is ready to sell

487
00:48:30,310 --> 00:48:32,078
lnform uncle

488
00:48:47,594 --> 00:48:49,095
Once the labourers leave tomorrow,

489
00:48:49,129 --> 00:48:50,463
we will start digging
in this direction

490
00:48:51,598 --> 00:48:53,900
All this mud can
be removed and put here

491
00:48:55,168 --> 00:48:58,104
We have to finish
this in three nights

492
00:49:05,211 --> 00:49:07,747

493
00:49:08,748 --> 00:49:10,016

Moves certainly. - lt's a lovely car.

00:57:41,428 --> 00:57:45,131
Don't bite the hand that feeds you

563
00:57:48,935 --> 00:57:51,638
Uncle, l have to get married sometime

564
00:57:53,707 --> 00:57:55,175

565
00:57:57,577 --> 00:58:00,247

care of you boys, if l had?

566

l did everything you asked me to

569
00:58:12,158 --> 00:58:13,893
l never asked you anything.

570
00:58:16,363 --> 00:58:18,265
Does she know what
you do for a living?

571
00:58:19,966 --> 00:58:21,134
Why you're here?

572
00:58:26,473 --> 00:58:28,074
Suraj was killed

573
00:58:29,943 --> 00:58:31,678
He was trying to escape

574
00:58:32,612 --> 00:58:35,782
He had two daughters And a son

575
00:58:37,150 --> 00:58:38,418
You know that

576
00:58:39,519 --> 00:58:41,087
This is the life we live

577
00:58:41,421 --> 00:58:42,656
ls this what you want to give her?

578
00:58:54,734 --> 00:58:58,038
l want you in Calcutta tomorrow

579
00:58:59,306 --> 00:59:03,877
We cant afford the luxury
of relationships in our work

580
00:59:05,679 --> 00:59:07,314
You still tried

581
00:59:08,214 --> 00:59:11,885
Don't think l cant tell your
father-in-law what you really are

582
01:02:03,823 --> 01:02:05,759
Good morning gentlemen

583
01:02:16,369 --> 01:02:17,270

584
01:02:17,837 --> 01:02:19,673
Congratulations, lets go

585
01:03:25,071 --> 01:03:26,406
Fake, they're all fake

586
01:03:26,406 --> 01:03:28,041
Not a single original note

587
01:06:16,276 --> 01:06:17,777
Dinner is ready

588
01:06:35,061 --> 01:06:36,196
Should l go home?

589
01:06:38,965 --> 01:06:40,133
Yes

590
01:06:42,669 --> 01:06:44,170
Do you need anything else?

591
01:06:45,505 --> 01:06:46,106
No

592
01:07:58,445 --> 01:07:59,379
Ms Pakhi

593
01:08:01,348 --> 01:08:07,821
You know Varun better than anyone

594
01:08:08,588 --> 01:08:10,824
lf you won't help then it is

595
01:08:10,824 --> 01:08:13,426
difficult to nab their whole gang.

596
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:23,336
What happened in Manikpur,

597
01:08:23,336 --> 01:08:25,305
has happened many times before

598
01:08:26,439 --> 01:08:28,842
This gang has robbed millions
from Zamindars and Rajas

599
01:08:28,842 --> 01:08:30,944
Many families have been ruined

600
01:08:31,611 --> 01:08:35,248
Your father wasn't the
only one who died because of them

601
01:08:36,182 --> 01:08:39,719
My father didn't die
because he was robbed

602
01:08:42,255 --> 01:08:44,024
He was heartbroken

603
01:08:45,492 --> 01:08:46,893
Deceived him.

604
01:08:49,996 --> 01:08:51,898
He trusted Varun.

605
01:08:52,165 --> 01:08:54,434
lf he were alive?

606
01:08:54,668 --> 01:08:58,838
He would want Varun to pay, isn't it?

607
01:08:59,839 --> 01:09:02,309
l don't want revenge, Mr. Singh

608
01:09:03,209 --> 01:09:05,111
l just want to forget him

609
01:09:13,687 --> 01:09:14,654
Ok

610
01:09:19,859 --> 01:09:23,163
lf you need anything or...

611
01:09:25,131 --> 01:09:28,268

01:09:29,903 --> 01:09:32,005
You can contact me on this number.

614
01:09:49,856 --> 01:09:51,024
What are you writing?

615
01:09:53,893 --> 01:09:56,363
''l'm right here..''

616
01:09:56,830 --> 01:09:58,231
Some story?

617
01:09:58,465 --> 01:09:59,332
Yes

618
01:10:02,869 --> 01:10:03,937
What story?

619
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:08,008
lt's just a story

620
01:10:12,245 --> 01:10:13,713
ls there a boy in the story?

621
01:10:18,118 --> 01:10:19,219
And a girl?

622
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:21,655
Yes

623
01:10:24,357 --> 01:10:26,259
Do they love each other?

624
01:10:32,632 --> 01:10:33,233
No

625
01:10:35,302 --> 01:10:36,770
Are they going to fall in love?

626
01:10:41,074 --> 01:10:42,208
l don't know

627
01:10:53,620 --> 01:10:55,488
The boy wants to know something

628
01:10:58,491 --> 01:11:00,393
The girl isn't talking to him

629
01:11:02,329 --> 01:11:04,030
ls she angry?

630
01:11:05,765 --> 01:11:06,733
Yes

631
01:11:08,435 --> 01:11:10,303
Because he's leaving?

632
01:11:10,971 --> 01:11:13,673
Because he's asking
too many questions

633
01:11:15,041 --> 01:11:16,509
So what is she saying?

634
01:11:18,311 --> 01:11:21,381
Don't ask so many questions

635
01:11:21,781 --> 01:11:22,682
So?

636
01:11:24,517 --> 01:11:26,753
Has he stopped asking questions?

637
01:11:32,058 --> 01:11:33,994
He's a fool

638
01:11:35,362 --> 01:11:38,198
Doesn't even understand a thing

639
01:11:44,337 --> 01:11:47,908
Has the boy told the
girl how beautiful she is?

640
01:11:51,711 --> 01:11:53,947
That there's nobody more beautiful
than her in the whole world.

641
01:11:58,285 --> 01:11:59,352
No

642
01:12:00,387 --> 01:12:05,659
Has the girl told the boy
that she loves him the most?

643
01:12:07,861 --> 01:12:08,929
No

644
01:12:13,300 --> 01:12:15,135
So when is she going to tell him?

645
01:12:21,808 --> 01:12:23,176
When?

646
01:12:58,278 --> 01:12:59,479
Dalhousie police station

647
01:12:59,713 --> 01:13:01,615
Can l talk to lnspector K N Singh?

648
01:13:01,881 --> 01:13:02,916
Who's speaking?

649
01:13:03,283 --> 01:13:04,684
Pakhi Ray Chowdhury

650
01:13:04,818 --> 01:13:05,785
Hold please.

651
01:13:20,934 --> 01:13:22,235
KN Singh speaking

652
01:13:24,004 --> 01:13:27,107
He had once told me
that the Raja of Jandhrighat

653
01:13:27,407 --> 01:13:31,177
owns a valuable idol of Ganesha.
Made of pure gold

654
01:13:32,078 --> 01:13:34,281
Maybe their next target
will be in Dalhousie.

655
01:13:35,548 --> 01:13:36,917
Thank you

656
01:13:37,751 --> 01:13:38,285
Ok

657
01:14:28,301 --> 01:14:30,937
Guesthouse available on rent

658
01:16:03,964 --> 01:16:05,165
lt's tuberculosis

659
01:16:05,732 --> 01:16:07,167
lt's life threatening

660
01:16:08,268 --> 01:16:10,303
You should move to a warm place

661
01:16:11,438 --> 01:16:12,772
You will live longer

662
01:16:14,774 --> 01:16:16,910
Everyone dies some day

663
01:16:17,844 --> 01:16:19,579
What should l live for?

664
01:16:22,782 --> 01:16:24,551
You could write another book

665
01:16:29,356 --> 01:16:32,392
My life is being taken
by what l am writing

666
01:16:49,075 --> 01:16:52,178
Did l ever tell you
the Bheel Raja story?

667
01:16:52,345 --> 01:16:53,380
No

668
01:16:55,448 --> 01:16:57,217
A long time ago, there lived the...

669
01:16:57,317 --> 01:16:59,286
mighty Raja of the Bheel tribe.

670
01:17:01,221 --> 01:17:02,322
No one could ever harm him.

671
01:17:04,424 --> 01:17:07,761
The English made many
attempts on his life.

672
01:17:08,428 --> 01:17:10,030
They cut him with swords,

673
01:17:11,097 --> 01:17:12,432
they slit him with a thousand arrows,

674
01:17:13,099 --> 01:17:14,367
but he just wouldn't die.

675
01:17:17,037 --> 01:17:20,273
Then they heard that the Raja...

676
01:17:20,607 --> 01:17:22,642
confined his life in a parrot.

677
01:17:23,877 --> 01:17:26,646
But there were a thousand
parrots in the forest.

678
01:17:26,680 --> 01:17:29,316
Which one would it be?

679
01:17:32,686 --> 01:17:34,854
One fine day the
spy found the parrot

680
01:17:35,488 --> 01:17:39,125
where the Raja's life was confined

681
01:18:00,146 --> 01:18:01,548
There's two men at the gate

682
01:18:01,982 --> 01:18:03,483
For the guesthouse

683
01:18:04,484 --> 01:18:05,552
What should l do?

684
01:18:08,255 --> 01:18:09,356
Show it to them

685
01:19:13,086 --> 01:19:14,588
Who stays out there?

686
01:19:15,055 --> 01:19:16,289
The Lady of the house.

687
01:19:16,690 --> 01:19:17,824
She is not keeping well.

688
01:19:18,191 --> 01:19:19,292
Please come.

689
01:19:48,955 --> 01:19:52,826
Hello - Ms Pakhi,
this is lnspector K N Singh

690
01:19:53,193 --> 01:19:53,627
Yes

691
01:19:53,927 --> 01:20:00,367
l called to inform you that
the gang leader has been arrested

692
01:20:01,034 --> 01:20:04,037
He's confessed that Varun and Debdas

693
01:20:04,738 --> 01:20:07,073
should be reaching
Dalhousie any day now.

694
01:20:07,307 --> 01:20:10,744
We have booked all the
places where they can stay

695
01:20:11,578 --> 01:20:14,514
They will eventually
reach your cottage

696
01:20:15,515 --> 01:20:17,417
As soon as they do...

697
01:20:26,927 --> 01:20:28,995
Excuse me, Mr. Vijay?

698
01:20:29,129 --> 01:20:30,363
What happened?

699
01:20:42,208 --> 01:20:44,477
How do you plan to ship
the idol to the Museum?

700
01:20:44,611 --> 01:20:45,779
By truck

701
01:20:45,946 --> 01:20:47,581
lt's on its way from Delhi

702
01:20:47,814 --> 01:20:49,449
And security?

703
01:20:49,616 --> 01:20:55,322
Six of our people
will accompany the truck

704
01:20:55,689 --> 01:20:57,891
And if you wish,
you can send some people too

705
01:20:58,692 --> 01:21:00,393
So how can l help?

706
01:21:00,594 --> 01:21:03,630
We need to take measurements
of the idol for the shipping crate

707
01:21:03,763 --> 01:21:07,667
So if you don't mind,
could we start work tomorrow?

708
01:21:08,568 --> 01:21:09,269
That's it?

709
01:21:09,302 --> 01:21:10,737
We can stay here if you'd like

710
01:21:16,910 --> 01:21:18,211
Come tomorrow

711
01:21:18,411 --> 01:21:21,548

that you'll be coming from tomorrow.

712
01:21:39,933 --> 01:21:41,001

He's not answering the phone

Must be asleep

723
01:23:41,321 --> 01:23:42,522

Have you given him any medicine yet?

735
01:30:32,666 --> 01:30:34,167
Not yet Doctor

736
01:30:34,234 --> 01:30:35,235
How far is it from here?

737
01:30:35,268 --> 01:30:36,536
Five minutes

01:30:36,937 --> 01:30:38,338
ls he breathing okay?

739
01:32:06,893 --> 01:32:07,794

He's been shot

741
01:33:55,602 --> 01:33:57,604
Won't be able to get very far

Spread the word

744
01:34:02,776 --> 01:34:05,312
Put up his sketch everywhere

745
01:34:05,745 --> 01:34:06,846
Yes, sir!

746
01:34:07,847 --> 01:34:09,449
l want this man

747
01:34:10,216 --> 01:34:12,619
Keep looking till you find him

748
01:34:13,720 --> 01:34:15,355
Dead or Alive?

749
01:35:18,618 --> 01:35:23,590
You told the police!!

750
01:36:27,320 --> 01:36:29,489
My friend died because of you

751
01:36:31,224 --> 01:36:33,193
l won't let you die so easy

752
01:36:34,628 --> 01:36:37,530
l didn't think you
had any emotion in you

753
01:36:37,764 --> 01:36:39,633
You still don't know a lot, Pakhi.

754
01:36:40,567 --> 01:36:41,534
Please leave, Varun

755
01:36:41,534 --> 01:36:42,769
l need a place to hide

756
01:36:42,902 --> 01:36:44,237
You wont get it here

757
01:36:46,139 --> 01:36:47,807
Leave or l'll call the police

758
01:36:47,807 --> 01:36:48,808
You won't

759
01:37:03,456 --> 01:37:04,124
Close the door, Shyama

760
01:37:04,491 --> 01:37:05,058
Are you mad, Varun?

761
01:37:05,125 --> 01:37:06,893
Close the door, Shyama

762
01:37:08,828 --> 01:37:10,830
Did the police stop you?

763
01:37:24,311 --> 01:37:26,313
Did they ask you any questions?

764
01:37:27,047 --> 01:37:29,182
About me? - No

765
01:37:29,516 --> 01:37:31,484
Don't try to fool me, Shyama

766
01:37:35,288 --> 01:37:37,624
Your sketch is up everywhere

767
01:37:37,958 --> 01:37:39,526
They're looking for you

768
01:37:40,760 --> 01:37:43,129
You've been accused of
killing a police constable

769
01:37:43,997 --> 01:37:48,535
And they say that
you killed your friend

770
01:37:48,802 --> 01:37:50,403
You killed Deb?

771
01:37:51,638 --> 01:37:53,807
There are shoot-at-sight
orders for you.

772
01:37:58,345 --> 01:37:59,279
Who are you?

773
01:37:59,379 --> 01:38:01,648
He is an avatar of
Lord Vishnu, Shyama?

774
01:38:01,881 --> 01:38:03,350
With ten names and faces.

775
01:38:07,954 --> 01:38:10,156
l didn't kill Deb on purpose

776
01:38:10,457 --> 01:38:12,626
He was my friend, like my brother

777
01:38:12,692 --> 01:38:13,727
And the police constable?

778
01:38:14,261 --> 01:38:18,698
They were firing at me,
So l fired back. lt was a mistake.

779
01:38:18,765 --> 01:38:20,200
l don't believe you

780
01:38:20,433 --> 01:38:21,101
lt's the truth

781
01:38:21,101 --> 01:38:22,335
You should have said the truth then,

782
01:38:22,369 --> 01:38:23,236
a lot would have been saved

783
01:38:23,303 --> 01:38:25,939
l couldn't betray
Deb and Bajpai Uncle

784
01:38:26,373 --> 01:38:29,643
He raised us,
when we were this little.

785
01:38:29,843 --> 01:38:32,612
l couldn'tjust abandon them

786
01:38:33,647 --> 01:38:35,215
But you could abandon me

787
01:38:36,216 --> 01:38:38,251
You could betray my trust

788
01:38:40,320 --> 01:38:41,888
You wouldn't understand

789
01:38:42,322 --> 01:38:43,356
You've seen nothing

790
01:38:43,356 --> 01:38:45,625
You've lived in luxury all your life.

791
01:38:45,692 --> 01:38:47,060
You wouldn't understand anything.

792
01:38:54,601 --> 01:38:55,268
Keep it

793
01:38:55,268 --> 01:38:56,836
Use it in the kitchen

794
01:39:11,318 --> 01:39:13,053
Should l call the police?

795
01:39:13,353 --> 01:39:14,588
No.

796
01:39:16,222 --> 01:39:17,991
Why are you trying to save him?

797
01:39:45,986 --> 01:39:46,987
Hello.

798
01:39:48,655 --> 01:39:49,990
Hello. - Chaubey...?

799
01:39:50,657 --> 01:39:51,658
lt's Nandu

800
01:39:56,363 --> 01:39:57,831
l will leave tomorrow morning

801
01:39:59,432 --> 01:40:00,900
l'll have to spend the night here

802
01:40:02,636 --> 01:40:04,337
You can call the police, if you want

803
01:40:15,115 --> 01:40:15,582
Zamindar Babu...?

804
01:40:15,582 --> 01:40:16,483
ls dead.

805
01:40:22,088 --> 01:40:22,956
How?

806
01:40:26,059 --> 01:40:27,294
You killed him

807
01:40:29,663 --> 01:40:31,231
Like you killed Deb

808
01:40:33,800 --> 01:40:35,201
lt wasn't your fault

809
01:41:38,865 --> 01:41:40,300
l am going home

810
01:41:42,269 --> 01:41:43,703
l won't tell the police anything

811
01:41:59,319 --> 01:42:01,821
l came here to run away from my past

812
01:42:02,222 --> 01:42:03,924
To forget everything

813
01:42:05,058 --> 01:42:07,093
Why did you come back to my life?

814
01:42:07,727 --> 01:42:09,763
Why did l allow you to?

815
01:42:10,130 --> 01:42:14,200
Why don't l just kill you,
when you are asleep?

816
01:42:15,302 --> 01:42:18,738
lt must give you so
much joy to see me like this

817
01:42:21,207 --> 01:42:22,475
You see that tree?

818
01:42:23,143 --> 01:42:25,412
l stare at it, day and night.

819
01:42:26,246 --> 01:42:28,114
As if its that Bheel Raja's parrot...

820
01:42:29,115 --> 01:42:30,483
...with my life inside it.

821
01:42:32,819 --> 01:42:35,488
l stare at its leaves that fall.

822
01:42:37,357 --> 01:42:41,962
The day the last leaf falls...

823
01:42:42,929 --> 01:42:44,731
...is the day l will breathe my last.

824
01:42:46,232 --> 01:42:49,069
This is where you have brought me to

825
01:42:53,840 --> 01:42:57,010
l hope you are ashamed
of living like this.

826
01:42:58,111 --> 01:43:01,181
But l know you don't care

827
01:43:02,282 --> 01:43:04,651
As always, all you will do is hide

828
01:43:27,340 --> 01:43:33,246
''The complaints are fading away.''

829
01:43:33,480 --> 01:43:39,119
''The dawn's untainted.''

830
01:43:39,819 --> 01:43:45,759
''lt's melting the snow.''

831
01:43:45,992 --> 01:43:51,464
''There's a fire burning somewhere.''

832
01:43:51,998 --> 01:43:57,537
''l didn't want to fly this time.''

833
01:43:58,271 --> 01:44:04,044
''Even the birds agreed.''

834
01:44:04,444 --> 01:44:10,016
''With the darkness
tucked in the arms.''

835
01:44:10,617 --> 01:44:14,387
''The light's here to stay.''

836
01:44:16,623 --> 01:44:22,395
''lt has returned that
thing stolen from me.''

837
01:44:22,963 --> 01:44:29,536
''The complaints are fading away.''

838
01:44:43,683 --> 01:44:49,623
''You're my victory.
While l am the defeat.''

839
01:44:49,823 --> 01:44:55,795
''l am the bond that connects us.''

840
01:44:55,996 --> 01:45:01,901
''You're my victory.
While l am the defeat.''

841
01:45:05,805 --> 01:45:11,378
''Tell me my mistakes.''

842
01:45:11,778 --> 01:45:17,417
''The stars can decide my fate.''

843
01:45:17,984 --> 01:45:23,290
''Turn the looters into protectors.''

844
01:45:24,124 --> 01:45:30,463
''lt's all about fate.''

845
01:45:35,268 --> 01:45:40,740
''lt's a story of earth.''

846
01:45:41,308 --> 01:45:47,180
''This is austerity.''

847
01:45:47,547 --> 01:45:53,753
''The complaints are fading away.''

848
01:45:59,593 --> 01:46:05,498
''l didn't want to fly this time.''

849
01:46:05,865 --> 01:46:11,404
''Even the birds agreed.''

850
01:46:11,972 --> 01:46:17,210
''With the darkness
tucked in the arms.''

851
01:46:18,178 --> 01:46:21,715
''The light's here to stay.''

852
01:46:24,351 --> 01:46:27,787
''lt has returned that
thing stolen from me.''

853
01:46:28,021 --> 01:46:29,422
Nandu!

854
01:46:30,624 --> 01:46:36,162
''The complaints are fading away.''

855
01:46:36,429 --> 01:46:40,433
''The dawn's untainted.''

856
01:46:42,602 --> 01:46:45,772
''The dawn's untainted.''

857
01:46:57,284 --> 01:46:58,785
lts still unsafe outside

858
01:47:00,620 --> 01:47:02,155
l will have to stay
here for a few more days

859
01:47:36,489 --> 01:47:37,524
Tea

860
01:47:51,004 --> 01:47:52,539
l don't want

861
01:47:58,979 --> 01:48:00,981
What are you trying to prove?

862
01:48:01,047 --> 01:48:01,948
Nothing

863
01:48:02,315 --> 01:48:04,150
When you should have done...
- l went away, l know.

864
01:48:04,517 --> 01:48:06,419
You were surrounded by people.

865
01:48:09,589 --> 01:48:10,690
l know what you want.

866
01:48:10,790 --> 01:48:11,391
ls it?

867
01:48:11,591 --> 01:48:12,225
What?

868
01:48:12,492 --> 01:48:14,995
Once wasn't enough for you.

869
01:48:15,195 --> 01:48:17,364
Of course, since you're
looking beautiful these days

870
01:48:18,665 --> 01:48:19,799
l am not joking

871
01:48:19,899 --> 01:48:21,534
l don't know how to make jokes

872
01:48:22,836 --> 01:48:24,337
Why don't you eat something,
then we can...

873
01:48:24,938 --> 01:48:25,805
Just leave

874
01:48:25,972 --> 01:48:26,573
Pakhi

875
01:48:26,673 --> 01:48:27,707
Don't say my name!

876
01:48:27,874 --> 01:48:30,210
Don't shout,
you'll get another attack

877
01:48:43,523 --> 01:48:44,624
See, l told you

878
01:48:44,724 --> 01:48:45,825
Why are you... - Shut up

879
01:50:53,587 --> 01:50:56,623
Sometimes l feel like murdering you.

880
01:50:58,959 --> 01:51:01,027
l hate you so much.

881
01:51:03,229 --> 01:51:05,999
But l don't have the strength anymore

882
01:51:08,501 --> 01:51:10,770
l just want to release Varun

883
01:51:13,540 --> 01:51:14,674
from you,

884
01:51:16,776 --> 01:51:17,877
from myself,

885
01:51:18,678 --> 01:51:21,848
from this life

886
01:52:30,984 --> 01:52:37,591
''The springs came and went.''

887
01:52:39,359 --> 01:52:45,465
''But l didn't experience
a single one.''

888
01:52:47,767 --> 01:52:54,474
''My heart was drenched this time.''

889
01:52:56,343 --> 01:53:02,749
''l wonder what you did?''

890
01:53:04,551 --> 01:53:11,658
''The heart's...feeling
intimate again..''

891
01:53:12,092 --> 01:53:18,932
''O tormentor.''

892
01:53:21,268 --> 01:53:24,704
''My stubbornness..''

893
01:53:25,639 --> 01:53:27,908
''Persuaded my innocent heart..''

894
01:53:28,842 --> 01:53:36,116
''O tormentor.''

895
01:53:54,834 --> 01:54:02,175
''Tosses the heart...around
like a coin.''

896
01:54:02,442 --> 01:54:09,082
''O tormentor.''

897
01:54:11,751 --> 01:54:18,258
''My stubbornness..
persuaded my innocent heart.''

898
01:54:19,259 --> 01:54:25,932
''O tormentor.''

899
01:54:32,806 --> 01:54:40,247
''Mannerless, but unique.''

900
01:54:40,347 --> 01:54:46,286
''O tormentor.''

901
01:54:57,931 --> 01:55:04,571
''l lost my conscious.''

902
01:55:05,438 --> 01:55:12,412
''But, still in my
senses.'' ''O tormentor.''

903
01:55:14,648 --> 01:55:21,621
''My stubbornness..
persuaded my innocent heart.''

904
01:55:22,322 --> 01:55:29,162
''O tormentor.''

905
01:57:42,462 --> 01:57:43,830
May l come in?

906
01:57:50,604 --> 01:57:52,272
l tried calling, quite a few times

907
01:57:52,505 --> 01:57:53,940
No one answered

908
01:57:54,808 --> 01:57:56,910
ls everything ok?

909
01:57:58,878 --> 01:58:01,181
Just a little cough

910
01:58:03,283 --> 01:58:05,986
Did you see him or meet him?

911
01:58:06,753 --> 01:58:07,654
Who?

912
01:58:09,389 --> 01:58:10,223
Varun

913
01:58:11,191 --> 01:58:12,792
Why would l meet him?

914
01:58:13,593 --> 01:58:16,296
You said he might come

915
01:58:16,630 --> 01:58:18,098
The guesthouse is still empty

916
01:58:18,465 --> 01:58:20,200
The 'For Rent' board is still there

917
01:58:21,167 --> 01:58:21,968
Yes

918
01:58:25,171 --> 01:58:26,239
Can l look inside?

919
01:58:27,374 --> 01:58:28,742
Do you have a warrant?

920
01:58:28,909 --> 01:58:29,876
Sorry?

921
01:58:30,977 --> 01:58:32,412
Do you have a warrant?

922
01:58:34,547 --> 01:58:35,749
l don't have one right now,

923
01:58:35,916 --> 01:58:38,051
but l can get one tomorrow

924
01:58:38,985 --> 01:58:40,787
Then please come tomorrow

925
01:58:42,756 --> 01:58:44,958
Why are you trying to protect him?

926
01:58:45,158 --> 01:58:47,127
l am not protecting anyone

927
01:58:47,327 --> 01:58:49,562
He's responsible
for your father's death,

928
01:58:49,562 --> 01:58:52,032
and he shot one of my men

929
01:58:52,933 --> 01:58:57,170
He will spend the
rest of his life in jail

930
01:58:57,470 --> 01:58:58,872
He might even hang

931
01:59:02,108 --> 01:59:04,911
l'll be back tomorrow
with the warrant

932
01:59:05,445 --> 01:59:09,115
l'll have ten policemen
with me who l am leaving outside

933
01:59:09,316 --> 01:59:12,319
lf he tries to escape at night,
they will shoot him

934
01:59:12,419 --> 01:59:15,055
lf not, then tomorrow
l will shoot him

935
01:59:15,722 --> 01:59:17,390
l already shot him once,

936
01:59:17,757 --> 01:59:21,161
He's badly injured but he got away

937
01:59:23,063 --> 01:59:24,497
Not this time

938
02:00:10,577 --> 02:00:12,412
Do you know my real name?

939
02:00:15,882 --> 02:00:16,950
What?

940
02:00:21,454 --> 02:00:23,156
Atmanand Tripathi

941
02:00:45,979 --> 02:00:47,881
You look beautiful when you smile

942
02:00:51,851 --> 02:00:54,220
K N Singh is going to kill you

943
02:00:57,190 --> 02:00:59,359
You know what Deb
would have said to that?

944
02:01:00,093 --> 02:01:01,061
What?

945
02:01:02,696 --> 02:01:08,168
There isn't a KN Singh or Rahman
alive who can ruin Dev Anand's hair

946
02:01:10,036 --> 02:01:11,938
You are not a hero

947
02:01:13,540 --> 02:01:15,242
He won't be able to touch me

948
02:01:16,343 --> 02:01:18,378
l have escaped from much worse

949
02:01:20,347 --> 02:01:22,349
He'll bring the warrant tomorrow

950
02:01:23,617 --> 02:01:25,518
l'll leave tonight

951
02:01:35,328 --> 02:01:36,997
Don't look away Pakhi

952
02:01:40,400 --> 02:01:41,534
Look at me

953
02:01:46,273 --> 02:01:47,507
Listen

954
02:01:48,508 --> 02:01:49,509
Listen

955
02:01:54,080 --> 02:01:56,750
l know you don't
believe a word l say,

956
02:01:56,750 --> 02:01:58,919
But today l'm not lying

957
02:01:59,586 --> 02:02:04,624
l cannot forgive myself
for what l did to you

958
02:02:05,558 --> 02:02:08,094
Only you have the right to do that

959
02:02:08,161 --> 02:02:09,930
But l hate myself

960
02:02:10,030 --> 02:02:12,465
and l will keep hating
myself as long as l live

961
02:02:15,635 --> 02:02:18,338
Did you ever love me Varun?

962
02:02:18,805 --> 02:02:21,174
l did

963
02:02:22,142 --> 02:02:23,310
l still do

964
02:02:25,345 --> 02:02:28,448
You were my only chance
to lead a better life

965
02:02:28,615 --> 02:02:30,250
And l threw it away

966
02:02:31,418 --> 02:02:34,054
Everyone in my life used me

967
02:02:35,555 --> 02:02:37,190
Only you loved me

968
02:02:39,092 --> 02:02:40,961
And l couldn't love you back

969
02:02:45,131 --> 02:02:49,569
This isn't the life
you should be living

970
02:02:50,670 --> 02:02:54,708
Depending on that
last leaf isn't right

971
02:02:55,408 --> 02:02:57,177
lt isn't your parrot

972
02:02:57,677 --> 02:02:59,579
And if it falls?

973
02:03:02,849 --> 02:03:04,184
lt won't

974
02:03:05,885 --> 02:03:07,654
That's my promise.

975
02:06:36,529 --> 02:06:41,301
''Let me be.''

976
02:06:41,801 --> 02:06:46,373
''Let me be.''

977
02:06:46,840 --> 02:06:51,077
''l am alive, that's all l need.''

978
02:06:52,112 --> 02:06:56,283
''l am alive, that's all l need.''

979
02:07:00,320 --> 02:07:04,724
''Let me be.''

980
02:07:05,825 --> 02:07:10,597
''Let me be.''

981
02:07:10,797 --> 02:07:15,568
''l am alive, that's all l need.''

982
02:07:16,102 --> 02:07:20,740
''l am alive, that's all l need.''

983
02:07:59,246 --> 02:08:03,316
''l asked the winds for my share.''

984
02:08:04,651 --> 02:08:09,022
''And in return l got my breath.''

985
02:08:09,889 --> 02:08:14,060
''When l struck a conversation
with my loneliness.''

986
02:08:15,161 --> 02:08:19,599
''My heart called out to me.''

987
02:08:20,600 --> 02:08:24,838
''The story l started.''

988
02:08:25,972 --> 02:08:30,443
''l've to complete it.''

989
02:08:30,944 --> 02:08:36,383
''l want life to stand
proud at my grave.''

990
02:08:36,783 --> 02:08:41,354
''That's how l want to die.''

991
02:08:41,821 --> 02:08:46,493
''l've nothing left to wish for.''

992
02:08:47,160 --> 02:08:51,531
''l've nothing left to wish for.''

993
02:08:52,265 --> 02:08:56,937
''l got what l need.''

994
02:08:57,370 --> 02:09:01,908
''l am alive, that's all l need.''

995
02:09:03,176 --> 02:09:05,845
''Let me go.''

996
02:09:08,515 --> 02:09:11,084
''Let me go.''

997
02:09:13,820 --> 02:09:16,623
''Let me be.''

998
02:09:16,623 --> 02:09:19,025
''Let me be.''

999
02:09:19,025 --> 02:09:21,828
''Let me be.''

1000
02:12:41,528 --> 02:12:43,697
l don't know how to paint leaves.

1001
02:12:44,798 --> 02:12:46,299
l always draw it wrong.

1002
02:12:47,100 --> 02:12:48,335
Leaves!

1003
02:12:49,869 --> 02:12:51,071
They are really easy

1004
02:12:52,639 --> 02:12:53,640
Show me.

1005
02:13:01,014 --> 02:13:02,916
This is how it's done in Modern Art.

1006
02:13:10,457 --> 02:13:13,893
l want to paint a masterpiece
that the world will remember.

1007
02:14:04,110 --> 02:14:06,913
''Does the light ever..''

1008
02:14:09,049 --> 02:14:11,918
''Bring darkness with it.''

1009
02:14:14,187 --> 02:14:18,391
''The dried up ink.''

1010
02:14:19,159 --> 02:14:23,163
''Stands witness.''

1011
02:14:24,164 --> 02:14:29,202
''Of an age old story.''

1012
02:14:29,402 --> 02:14:35,175
''That remained untold.''

1013
02:14:37,911 --> 02:14:40,347
''That remained untold.''

1014
02:14:44,517 --> 02:14:48,021
''Does the light ever..''

1015
02:14:49,456 --> 02:14:52,292
''Bring darkness with it.''

1016
02:14:54,561 --> 02:14:58,531
''The dried up ink.''

1017
02:14:59,733 --> 02:15:02,702
''Stands witness.''

1018
02:15:04,638 --> 02:15:09,376
''Of an age old story.''

1019
02:15:09,776 --> 02:15:16,216
''That remained untold.''

1020
02:15:18,285 --> 02:15:20,420
''That remained untold.''

1021
02:15:50,183 --> 02:15:57,157
''Does the spring ever announce..''

1022
02:15:57,791 --> 02:16:02,028
''The coming of the fall?''

1023
02:16:05,398 --> 02:16:12,439
''The rains express their anger..''

1024
02:16:12,939 --> 02:16:16,710
''Of the sky.''

1025
02:16:20,547 --> 02:16:25,051
''The leaves that
fall from the branch.''

1026
02:16:25,719 --> 02:16:29,656
''Don't do so without a reason.''

1027
02:16:29,856 --> 02:16:32,525
''All of them.''

1028
02:16:35,695 --> 02:16:38,164
''A riddle of dreams.''

1029
02:16:40,767 --> 02:16:43,303
''Was it true or false?''

1030
02:16:45,772 --> 02:16:49,009
''Patted my forehead.''

1031
02:16:50,744 --> 02:16:53,413
''And stole my slumber.''

1032
02:16:55,849 --> 02:17:04,190
''Of an age old story.''

1033
02:17:04,524 --> 02:17:06,559
''That remained untold.''

1034
02:17:09,462 --> 02:17:11,932
''That remained untold.''
