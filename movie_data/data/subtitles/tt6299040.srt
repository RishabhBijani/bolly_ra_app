00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:13,925
'India and Pakistan
have fought four battles.'

2
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:21,435
'1947, 1965, 1971 and 1999'

3
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:24,106
'But very few people know that...'

4
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:28,713
'...there was another
battle which was fought.'

5
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:31,279
'Far away...under the sea.'

6
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:50,092
<i>'1971 ...'</i>

7
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:53,898
'When Bangladesh was
known as East Pakistan.'

8
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,971
'For the first time.
the roots of tyrant west Pakistan...'

9
00:04:57,196 --> 00:04:59,301
'...seemed to be loosing
their roots in the east.'

10
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:02,977
'The rebellion by the Bengali
Nationalist revolutionaries...'

11
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:04,577
'...was on a all time high.'

12
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:07,752
'Agitated by their Guerilla
Army 'Mukti Bahini'...

13
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,754
'...the Pakistani government
launched 'Operation Searchlight'.

14
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:15,682
'Soon the roads of Dhaka.
Chittagong, Sylhet, Khulna...

15
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:17,955
...and Jessore were soaked in blood.'

16
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:20,728
'Millions of east
Pakistani refugees...'

17
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:24,365
'...entered the borders
of India expecting help.'

18
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:27,535
'Now India and Pakistan's
attitude towards each other...'

19
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:29,629
'...started getting sterner.'

20
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,571
'But Pakistan's approach was clear.'

21
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,775
'Any Bengali who were suspected...'

22
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:38,509
'...of being Nationalists
or their supporters.'

23
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:44,688
'The Pakistani army would drag them
out of their homes...and kill them.'

24
00:06:04,163 --> 00:06:06,541
"Hello...this is
All India Radio, Delhi."

25
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,273
"I am Anand Trivedi."

26
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:10,038
"And now for the main headlines."

27
00:06:10,336 --> 00:06:14,284
"Tension and violence continues
to build in East Pakistan."

28
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:17,118
"Pakistan's President
Yahya Khan has said..."

29
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:20,018
"..that the opposition groups
are getting open support from India."

30
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:23,292
"in return, Prime Minister
Indira Gandhi clarified that..."

31
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:26,796
"...India has no association with the internal
conflicts of its neighboring country."

32
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:29,626
"But if Pakistan decides
to take any military action..."

33
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:33,062
"...then our armies are capable
of giving a fitting reply."

34
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:37,703
Papa, if there's a
war will you have to go?

35
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:40,135
No, dear. You just heard.

36
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,878
This is between East
Pakistan and West Pakistan.

37
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,946
And Vizag is miles away.

38
00:06:45,037 --> 00:06:46,209
We have nothing to fear.

39
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:06,795
Mr. President's instructions
are absolutely clear.

40
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:12,069
We cannot not lose hold
on the radicals in East Pakistan.

41
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:20,841
Sir, for that...our armies
must keep getting continuous supplies.

42
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:28,816
This is exactly why I was summoned.

43
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:31,392
We have a geographical disadvantage.

44
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:37,457
East Pakistan is landlocked
by India from all three sides.

45
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:41,997
Sending supplies by
road ways is impossible.

46
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,874
By air, the supplies
will be insufficient.

47
00:07:45,698 --> 00:07:48,338
And anyway.
we'll have to enter Indian airspace.

48
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:50,770
In this situation...
we have only one option left.

49
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:54,510
The sea-route.

50
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:58,552
All the way...up here.

51
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:02,754
We can tackle the Indian fleet, but...

52
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:05,387
INS Vikrant!

53
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,828
You know...

54
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:10,925
The elephant of their sea.

55
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:18,173
21 aircrafts, Sea-Hawks,
Aleez, the French Anti-submarine jet.

56
00:08:18,364 --> 00:08:20,401
Long range rocket launchers.

57
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:25,845
And with all that, INS Vikrant
can block this entire area.

58
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:31,650
Sinking it...is very important.

59
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:33,952
It's not going to be easy.

60
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:38,089
I never said it would be.

61
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:41,531
And that's why we
must send our best team.

62
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:44,428
Depute Razzak

63
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:49,105
And if he fails in sinking
INS Vikrant, then...

64
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:51,439
...we must bring plan B into action.

65
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:55,172
Where we'll launch a surprise
attack on any one of the Indian ports.

66
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:58,972
They will shift their focus
on defending that port, and...

67
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:01,741
...open up a sea-route for us.

68
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,312
Mrs. Gandhi has said...
- Sir!

69
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:34,049
Give it to Raman sir.

70
00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:36,015
The intercepted message
has been decoded.

71
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:41,057
"Keep 2075TH hydraulic
oil in ample quantities."

72
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:45,322
2075TH Hydraulic oil?

73
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:49,465
But it's used only in
specialized naval vessels.

74
00:09:51,123 --> 00:09:52,466
When was this message sent?

75
00:09:52,658 --> 00:09:53,932
36 hours back, sir.

76
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:55,131
Karachi to Chittagong.

77
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:57,832
Chittagong?

78
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:04,575
The obvious targets are Paradip.
Visakhapatnam, Madras...

79
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,974
...and Port Blair.

80
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:11,281
And if that's the case, then
they will launch a surprise attack.

81
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:13,588
Swift and from the high sea.

82
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:16,917
We must keep an eye on this area, sir.

83
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:20,990
What is the vessel status out there?

84
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:23,389
All deployed, sir...except S21.

85
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:26,296
Send it immediately...
for recce operation.

86
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:27,694
But sir...

87
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:31,307
S21 is under Capt.
Rann Vijay Singh's command.

88
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:33,636
And you know him pretty well.

89
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:38,012
We don't have time.

90
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,619
We cannot afford another Dwarka.

91
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:45,616
S21 must sail for search.
We've no choice.

92
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:49,285
If enemy presence is detected
in this search operation...

93
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:53,387
...then Capt. Rann Vijay Singh will
not wait for orders before attacking.

94
00:10:55,554 --> 00:10:57,261
Sir, it will trigger a war.

95
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:07,774
Where is Lt. Commander Arjun?

96
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:20,014
500 kms from Visakhapatnam Port.

97
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:23,158
80 degrees east...
600 nautical miles down.

98
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,226
This is our area of operation.

99
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:27,727
Sir. what are my orders sir?

100
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:32,065
Capt. Rann Vijay Singh.
your mission will be passive.

101
00:11:32,224 --> 00:11:33,931
This is just a search operation.

102
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:36,295
If you detect enemy presence.
you must report back.

103
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:38,106
And wait for further instructions.

104
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,534
And if l come face-to-face
with the enemy...

105
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:46,241
...do I 'still' report back.
wait for your instructions?

106
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:50,882
Yes...headquarters will
instruct you what to do next.

107
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,681
You have to follow the orders.

108
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,692
Lt. Commander Arjun will be with you.

109
00:11:58,184 --> 00:12:01,654
The Mission's called
'Operation Sea-Sight'.

110
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:04,794
And this is a classified mission.

111
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:10,939
Sir. if I see a...
- Remember. we're still not at war.

112
00:12:11,697 --> 00:12:12,767
Understand?

113
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,437
This is only a recce mission.

114
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:17,973
We've to wait and watch.

115
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:45,635
Don't worry, I'll be back soon.

116
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:49,273
Finally we're going to be
blessed with this bundle of joy.

117
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,677
Do you have to go?

118
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:57,418
Its duty...l must go.

119
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:01,915
And we must tell him
my stories of bravery too.

120
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:03,626
Love you.

121
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:05,124
Bye.

122
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:13,803
Sorry.

123
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:26,776
Good morning. sir.

124
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:29,780
How's your wife doing, Devaraj?
- Fine, sir.

125
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:31,115
The due date is in four days.

126
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:32,415
Oh, that's good.

127
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:33,788
Yes sir.

128
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:37,924
By the way.
sir...how long do we have to wait?

129
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:39,425
Officer Arjun is coming.

130
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:44,797
Look Arjun, we all know
Rann Vijay Singh very well.

131
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:46,998
And we've strict instructions...

132
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:50,506
Under no circumstances
do we attack first.

133
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,034
And that's your responsibility.

134
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:55,843
Sir.

135
00:14:10,716 --> 00:14:12,286
Pankaj, how are you?
- Fine.

136
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:15,256
See...

137
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:21,566
Where is your officer by the way?
- He's on his way.

138
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:24,163
We're almost ready to go, sir.

139
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:25,502
But we can't leave.

140
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:27,800
Political...

141
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,141
Our officer is coming, you see.

142
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:35,447
So we wait...and wait...wait...

143
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:39,386
Iqbal.
- Ramsagar.

144
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:40,718
How are you?
- Hello.

145
00:14:41,146 --> 00:14:43,490
You're their benefactor
until we all come back.

146
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,987
Apologies for the delay, sir.
- No problem.

147
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:49,799
He's Devaraj. Executive officer.
- Hello, sir.

148
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:52,062
Second in command.
- Sir.

149
00:14:52,124 --> 00:14:54,297
The orders are in your lockers.
- Okay.

150
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:56,667
These are the keys.

151
00:14:58,464 --> 00:14:59,943
Your mission goes as planned.

152
00:15:06,005 --> 00:15:07,006
The torpedo key.

153
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,781
I hope you won't need it.

154
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:26,967
Sir.

155
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:05,566
Cyclone forecasted, sir.

156
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:10,937
Between longitude 85 and latitude 76.

157
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:12,648
Fantastic.

158
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:16,215
So the enemy won't come that way.

159
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:20,213
And if they do show up...

160
00:16:26,218 --> 00:16:27,196
Then they won't go back.

161
00:16:36,628 --> 00:16:37,800
Okay, boys.

162
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:39,665
Check vents.

163
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:43,340
All marked, sir.
- Okay.

164
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:47,113
Depth test.
- Successful, sir.

165
00:16:58,717 --> 00:16:59,718
How is everything?

166
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:01,530
All set, sir.

167
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:03,389
Ready to dive.

168
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:08,031
Okay. Let's submerge the boat.
- Aye, sir.

169
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:13,502
All compartments, prepare to dive.

170
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,509
Diving in one minute.

171
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,137
Crew, alert and at your positions.

172
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:19,714
Switch, diesel to battery!

173
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:24,686
All batteries are running. sir.

174
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:33,988
Half ahead two...Dive to forty meters.

175
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,731
Alt...5 degrees.
- Aye, sir.

176
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:38,696
Half ahead two...Dive to forty meters.

177
00:17:39,024 --> 00:17:40,230
With 5 degrees aft bubble.

178
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:43,472
Sir, half ahead two.

179
00:17:57,176 --> 00:17:58,712
Two going half ahead, sir.

180
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:11,097
Dive to 40 meters with
5 degrees aft bubble.

181
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:12,065
Sir.

182
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:34,482
What's this, Surya?
For drying clothes, I guess.

183
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,078
Underwear...

184
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:37,711
For drying underwear...

185
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:39,778
Only if you wash them this year.

186
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:48,362
How can you dry clothes
on this shaky line?

187
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,957
Son, this 'shaky line' will tell us...

188
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,864
...how deep we've dived in the water.

189
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,261
You didn't get it?

190
00:19:56,662 --> 00:19:58,232
Come here, let me explain you.

191
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:03,703
Training kit for amateurs...
I always keep it handy.

192
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:05,813
Oh, God!

193
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:08,044
<i>Think of this egg as the submarine.</i>

194
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:10,218
And the entire ocean above it.

195
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:13,388
Not just this... the entire ocean.

196
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:15,514
According to the design

197
00:20:15,614 --> 00:20:19,084
...the S21 can dive up to 250 meters.

198
00:20:19,284 --> 00:20:21,924
Rumors say that it can go to 300.

199
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:24,293
But no one': ever dived that deep.

200
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:28,928
Can you imagine the
pressure of water...

201
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:30,837
...on the submarine at that depth?

202
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:37,903
How much?

203
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:41,908
200,000 tons.

204
00:20:48,213 --> 00:20:49,783
All systems are running fine, sir.

205
00:20:51,316 --> 00:20:52,317
Fantastic.

206
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:53,857
Conduct emergency drill.

207
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,192
Now, sir?
- Yes, why?

208
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,403
The crew hasn't completely
settled in, sir.

209
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:02,162
Yes. of course...

210
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:04,768
Before breaking your jaw...

211
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:07,140
...the enemy would like to know
whether you brushed your teeth, or not.

212
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,143
Whether we've settled down or not?

213
00:21:13,972 --> 00:21:15,144
Conduct the drill.

214
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:17,519
Sir.

215
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:19,047
Action stations!

216
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:20,245
Action stations!

217
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:21,449
Action stations!

218
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:22,982
This is a drill.

219
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,319
I repeat, this is a drill.

220
00:21:29,354 --> 00:21:31,391
7th compartment.
auxiliary pipe leaking.

221
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:32,298
Careful.

222
00:21:34,526 --> 00:21:35,504
Not like that.

223
00:21:36,561 --> 00:21:37,699
Fix it manually.

224
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:38,672
Come on hurry up.

225
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:39,900
Get the jack.

226
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,635
Where is the jack?

227
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:55,751
Hold it tight.

228
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:56,656
Fire in the battery unit.

229
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:02,023
Done. Done. Done.

230
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,927
Compartment 4...fire
in the battery unit, fix it.

231
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:12,304
It's stuck...get the hose-pipe
from the 7th compartment.

232
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:23,116
Fast! Fast! Fast!

233
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:25,812
Pull..Hurry up

234
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:35,091
You're not even fit to row a boat.

235
00:22:36,621 --> 00:22:37,759
Bungling buggers!

236
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:44,697
Sir...give them some time.
sir...they will fit in.

237
00:22:45,063 --> 00:22:46,872
Don't tell me what
to do and when to do it.

238
00:22:49,768 --> 00:22:53,341
Terminate this drill...and
train their bottoms off.

239
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:57,217
Yes, sir.
- Didn't hear you.

240
00:22:57,309 --> 00:22:59,050
Yes, sir.
- Didn't hear you.

241
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:00,919
Yes, sir.
- Didn't hear you.

242
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:02,583
<i>Yes...sir!</i>

243
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:25,871
He was suspended for two
years for this tyrant behavior.

244
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:28,381
He slapped two of his subordinates.

245
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:31,914
He hasn't changed yet.

246
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:39,858
Those who he slapped...

247
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:42,492
"also won medals later.

248
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:54,503
Capt. Rann Vijay always
does what's right.

249
00:23:54,966 --> 00:23:56,070
He's always right.

250
00:24:02,407 --> 00:24:03,579
Goodnight, Arjun.

251
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,238
Sir...

252
00:24:30,435 --> 00:24:31,436
Radio message.

253
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:05,747
Order to reach a location, sir.

254
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:09,444
Our first mission, gentlemen.
Let's toast to that.

255
00:25:22,554 --> 00:25:23,589
General Patton.

256
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:27,594
Every soldier's role model.

257
00:25:28,827 --> 00:25:30,033
They even made a movie on him.

258
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:33,637
It won the Oscar this year.
Did you see it?

259
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:35,739
I didn't see the film, sir...

260
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:38,974
...but I think General
Patton was too aggressive.

261
00:25:44,175 --> 00:25:45,210
He was aggressive...

262
00:25:48,013 --> 00:25:49,356
That's why he was successful.

263
00:25:55,020 --> 00:26:01,528
Battles are won by killing
the enemy...and not by dying.

264
00:26:04,496 --> 00:26:05,497
Cheers!

265
00:26:26,818 --> 00:26:29,526
Yes.
- Sir, we got the message.

266
00:26:30,288 --> 00:26:31,926
Everything': proceeding as planned.

267
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:34,133
Razzak is on his way.
- Good.

268
00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:36,806
Sir. this entire area is clear.

269
00:27:23,942 --> 00:27:26,013
Sir. no sonar contact
in this area either.

270
00:27:26,511 --> 00:27:28,752
Sir. we've had no
sonar contacts anywhere.

271
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,921
Shall we consider 'Operation
Sea-Sight a success?

272
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:46,574
Move aside...move...

273
00:27:47,265 --> 00:27:48,869
Good news everyone...

274
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:51,010
Our first mission is a success.

275
00:27:51,302 --> 00:27:53,111
Prepare to head home.

276
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:58,317
Brighten up...you can
go home and get married now.

277
00:27:58,443 --> 00:28:00,719
We'll start celebrating right here,
from hell.

278
00:28:02,247 --> 00:28:03,920
We'll have a ball.

279
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,561
We're keeping a close watch, sir.

280
00:28:12,223 --> 00:28:13,293
<i>Yes. slides. sir.</i>

281
00:28:15,927 --> 00:28:16,632
Sir.

282
00:28:16,895 --> 00:28:18,135
Mr. Girish Kumar from RAW.

283
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:19,674
He has information for us.

284
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:20,641
Hello.
- Hello.

285
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:26,706
Sir, I've classified information.

286
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:29,447
The Director gave me
special instructions...

287
00:28:30,141 --> 00:28:32,280
...that I must convey
this message to you personally.

288
00:28:34,446 --> 00:28:37,757
Sir, our trusted sources
in Karachi have confirmed that...

289
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:42,463
"Pakistan Navy has launched
an offensive mission against India.

290
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:44,458
What is their target?

291
00:28:46,758 --> 00:28:48,066
That's not confirmed yet.

292
00:28:48,426 --> 00:28:50,770
But according to our sources,
it can be Vikrant.

293
00:28:51,129 --> 00:28:53,837
We know that...submarine Ghazi...

294
00:28:54,165 --> 00:28:56,543
...has set sail from
Karachi for this mission.

295
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:58,411
Commander Razzak is leading.

296
00:28:59,604 --> 00:29:00,446
Thank you.

297
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:04,679
Indian Navy will be ready
for the counter operation.

298
00:29:04,809 --> 00:29:06,254
I am sure, sir. Thank you.

299
00:29:09,314 --> 00:29:10,156
Jai Hind, sir.

300
00:29:13,718 --> 00:29:14,423
Ghazi.

301
00:29:16,621 --> 00:29:18,726
Their most decorated submarine.

302
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:27,537
In '65 Ghazi alone gave cover
to all the Pak naval vessels.

303
00:29:28,666 --> 00:29:32,079
Speed...range...endurance...armament!

304
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:37,513
The Indian submarines cannot
equal Ghazi in any respect.

305
00:29:38,576 --> 00:29:40,920
And...a Commander like Razzak.

306
00:30:14,913 --> 00:30:16,688
Sir. the coordinates
we received were wrong.

307
00:30:17,515 --> 00:30:19,290
INS Vikrant is not
on these coordinates.

308
00:30:20,185 --> 00:30:21,755
It's just an Indian merchant ship.

309
00:30:24,756 --> 00:30:27,327
The information doesn't
have to be wrong. No!

310
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,771
The enemy can be swift.

311
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:36,075
Who knows...maybe the Indians
changed Vikrant': course.

312
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:40,981
Sir...now?

313
00:30:44,042 --> 00:30:46,215
Initiate plan B.
- Yes, sir...

314
00:30:46,377 --> 00:30:47,651
But before that...

315
00:30:49,047 --> 00:30:52,859
...we must divert the
Indian Navy's attention.

316
00:30:53,284 --> 00:30:54,194
Yes. sir...

317
00:31:18,977 --> 00:31:20,012
Sir...

318
00:31:20,311 --> 00:31:21,289
Strange echoes.

319
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:33,325
What's wrong?
- Sir, something': wrong.

320
00:31:33,424 --> 00:31:34,926
We can hear strange echoes.

321
00:31:44,102 --> 00:31:45,137
Periscope depth.

322
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:49,741
Go to periscope depth.

323
00:31:49,941 --> 00:31:51,511
Blow alt tank and forward tank. Quick.

324
00:32:08,493 --> 00:32:09,904
Depth 20 meters.

325
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:12,904
15 meters.

326
00:32:19,737 --> 00:32:22,616
Periscope depth...
maintaining depth nine meters, sir.

327
00:32:33,418 --> 00:32:34,726
Bloody cowards!

328
00:32:43,361 --> 00:32:44,669
Sir. survivors.

329
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:49,172
Anything in the sonar range?
- No, sir.

330
00:32:53,204 --> 00:32:55,343
Surface the boat.
- Aye, sir. Surfacing the boat.

331
00:32:55,506 --> 00:32:56,951
Turn off the engine.
- Yes, sir.

332
00:32:57,442 --> 00:32:58,921
Check the surroundings.
- Aye, sir.

333
00:33:16,127 --> 00:33:17,162
Radio room come in.

334
00:33:17,795 --> 00:33:19,069
Sir, Radio room to Control room.

335
00:33:20,198 --> 00:33:24,112
Message headquarters.
Indian Merchant ship sinking.

336
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:24,976
Aye, sir.

337
00:33:41,886 --> 00:33:42,728
Sir...

338
00:33:48,393 --> 00:33:49,701
Damn... Hold it.

339
00:34:05,777 --> 00:34:06,778
Shit.

340
00:34:09,814 --> 00:34:10,758
Merchant ship.

341
00:34:13,651 --> 00:34:15,597
Our enemy is not such a coward.

342
00:34:17,321 --> 00:34:18,459
Why merchant ship?

343
00:34:20,958 --> 00:34:22,699
Sir. no enemy presence.

344
00:34:26,364 --> 00:34:27,206
Come again, Devaraj.

345
00:34:27,265 --> 00:34:29,040
Presence of the enemy
not detected, sir.

346
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:32,245
That doesn't mean that
the enemy doesn't exist, Devaraj.

347
00:34:33,037 --> 00:34:34,846
Close that hatch and prepare to dive.
- Sir...

348
00:34:34,939 --> 00:34:36,976
But officer Arjun is outside.
- What?

349
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:41,982
He jumped in to save some civilians.

350
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:45,057
Oh my bleeding heart.

351
00:34:45,683 --> 00:34:47,720
Emotional bloody fools.

352
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:55,800
Sonar come in.
- Sonar to control room, sir.

353
00:34:56,027 --> 00:34:58,268
Is there anything in
the vicinity of 500 meters?

354
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,073
Negative, sir.
- Roger.

355
00:35:11,876 --> 00:35:12,946
Devaraj.

356
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:17,018
Sir...
- We've precisely 90 seconds.

357
00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:19,659
After that we'll be target
practice...for the enemy.

358
00:35:21,052 --> 00:35:25,125
On the 91st second,
we close the hatch and we dive.

359
00:35:25,423 --> 00:35:26,868
That's a bloody order!

360
00:35:30,261 --> 00:35:31,205
Yes. sir.

361
00:35:37,335 --> 00:35:38,905
Throw the lifebuoy.

362
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,244
Hurry HP-

363
00:35:54,585 --> 00:35:56,531
No, sir. Don't go.

364
00:35:56,787 --> 00:35:58,858
Sir, orders to dive immediately.

365
00:36:11,402 --> 00:36:14,178
Taan Singh, careful.
- Sir.

366
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:30,928
Diving in 30 seconds.

367
00:36:41,966 --> 00:36:42,842
Sir.

368
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:05,432
Sir. we've clearance.
We can move ahead.

369
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:33,461
Kamlakar, take her in.
- Sir.

370
00:37:34,352 --> 00:37:36,855
My beautiful Bengal... I adore you...

371
00:37:36,954 --> 00:37:39,298
Forever and ever. I've been...

372
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:41,495
Ma'am, this is the Indian Navy.
You're safe here.

373
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:43,071
Kamlakar, please take her in.
- Sir

374
00:37:45,896 --> 00:37:47,739
Dive! Dive! 100 meters!

375
00:37:48,966 --> 00:37:51,913
Let's find this enemy and
bury him into the ground, Devaraj.

376
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:55,217
Aye, sir.
- Sir, we cannot attack without clearance.

377
00:37:57,074 --> 00:38:01,181
I forgot...your government clearance.

378
00:38:02,847 --> 00:38:04,849
How many more lives of soldiers...

379
00:38:05,516 --> 00:38:07,689
...does your 'Clearance policy' want?

380
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:09,521
You know what.
make a beautiful bouquet...

381
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,156
...out of your bloody 'Clearance
policy' and send it to Islamabad.

382
00:38:11,822 --> 00:38:14,132
Along with the uniforms
of our martyred soldiers.

383
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:15,101
Gill.

384
00:38:16,427 --> 00:38:17,428
Listen, Mr. Officer.

385
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:22,802
I am not going to wait anymore
for this clearance business.

386
00:38:23,034 --> 00:38:23,774
Okay?

387
00:38:24,568 --> 00:38:25,638
If it comes, fine.

388
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:29,448
If not...I’m going to find my enemy...

389
00:38:29,674 --> 00:38:30,948
...and I am going to kill him.

390
00:38:31,342 --> 00:38:34,050
Sir. we act on conformation
and not assumptions.

391
00:38:34,345 --> 00:38:36,256
Sir, radio message. - How can we
say that this was an act of the enemy?

392
00:38:37,181 --> 00:38:37,818
And not an accident.

393
00:38:37,882 --> 00:38:39,020
Anything can be
responsible for the blast.

394
00:38:39,417 --> 00:38:40,953
Explosives. inflammable cargo.

395
00:38:43,354 --> 00:38:46,335
Sir. we can't act on your instincts.

396
00:38:56,534 --> 00:38:58,480
This is my bloody sub!

397
00:38:59,136 --> 00:39:00,410
Nobody tells me what to do.

398
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:07,389
Sir. message.

399
00:39:27,932 --> 00:39:29,434
Dive to 40 meters and hold.

400
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:31,210
Yes. sir.

401
00:39:32,336 --> 00:39:33,508
Devaraj.
- Sir.

402
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:37,148
<i>Just...just hold...</i>

403
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:39,947
...till the bloody enemy kills you.

404
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,823
Because that's the order.

405
00:39:45,616 --> 00:39:46,788
Politics.

406
00:39:50,821 --> 00:39:52,596
Dive to 40 meters.
- Aye, sir.

407
00:40:16,514 --> 00:40:18,892
Depth 40 meters, holding sir.

408
00:40:29,827 --> 00:40:31,272
We're both refugees.

409
00:40:32,696 --> 00:40:35,006
But, why were you singing
your rebel anthem?

410
00:40:36,567 --> 00:40:41,141
We thought you're...Pakistanis.
that's why.

411
00:40:42,406 --> 00:40:45,250
They can't tolerate our rebel anthem.

412
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:48,485
They shoot immediately.

413
00:40:49,013 --> 00:40:50,959
You mean...you wanted
to commit suicide.

414
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:54,422
At least that way I
could've saved our honor.

415
00:41:03,527 --> 00:41:04,437
Hi.

416
00:41:05,663 --> 00:41:07,267
Congrats, Father Devaraj.

417
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:09,172
How do you... - Ranjan has
already broadcasted this news...

418
00:41:09,266 --> 00:41:10,506
...over the entire submarine.

419
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:13,179
Thank you.

420
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:15,744
Here...

421
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:19,745
Congratulations.
- Thank you.

422
00:41:20,744 --> 00:41:22,314
Your child is very lucky...

423
00:41:24,114 --> 00:41:25,923
...to be born on
this side of the border.

424
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,859
Hey... Here.

425
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:35,761
Your happy birthday?
- No...

426
00:41:37,528 --> 00:41:39,838
My child...he's still very young.

427
00:41:40,231 --> 00:41:41,039
Just born today.

428
00:41:41,532 --> 00:41:45,912
Until now...we've been here,
here and at this point.

429
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:48,416
And the ship was destroyed here.

430
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:50,482
Their intentions are something else.

431
00:41:51,208 --> 00:41:52,209
Sir...

432
00:41:53,644 --> 00:41:54,554
It's a boy.

433
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:58,358
Congratulations!
- Thank you, sir.

434
00:41:58,582 --> 00:41:59,356
Congratulations!
- Thank you.

435
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:02,260
Thank God your wife didn't
keep your son on hold...

436
00:42:02,586 --> 00:42:03,621
Like our government.

437
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:07,368
Devaraj.
- Sir.

438
00:42:08,058 --> 00:42:09,036
Don't let this divert your attention.

439
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:11,070
We still have a lotto do.
- Absolutely not, sir.

440
00:42:21,305 --> 00:42:22,147
Diversion.

441
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:26,518
That's it.
- I didn't get it, sir.

442
00:42:28,279 --> 00:42:31,089
This merchant ship...was a diversion.

443
00:42:32,449 --> 00:42:34,759
They wanted us to focus
entirely on this area.

444
00:42:36,854 --> 00:42:38,731
This means their target
is something else.

445
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:42,799
On the east coast there's Paradip...

446
00:42:44,495 --> 00:42:45,439
"Madras...

447
00:42:47,431 --> 00:42:48,774
..Visakhapatnam...

448
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:52,937
Visakhapatnam!

449
00:42:55,539 --> 00:42:56,711
Target is Visakhapatnam!

450
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:00,817
Plot all coordinates to Vizag.
Let's move west immediately.

451
00:43:00,878 --> 00:43:01,856
Aye, sir.

452
00:43:08,986 --> 00:43:09,862
Rajiv.

453
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:21,042
Did you clean your ears too?
- Sorry, sir.

454
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:25,372
Check 10 degrees west.
- Sir'

455
00:43:41,652 --> 00:43:42,494
No contact, sir.

456
00:43:44,388 --> 00:43:46,334
Change frequency 10 degree west.
- Aye, sir.

457
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:56,777
Negative, sir.

458
00:44:01,271 --> 00:44:03,547
Further change frequency,
10 degrees west. - Aye, sir.

459
00:44:21,859 --> 00:44:23,566
Sir...sonar contact!

460
00:44:29,433 --> 00:44:30,207
One...

461
00:44:31,268 --> 00:44:31,939
Two...

462
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:33,644
Three...

463
00:44:34,538 --> 00:44:35,278
Four...

464
00:44:37,474 --> 00:44:38,282
Seven

465
00:44:39,309 --> 00:44:40,117
Eight...

466
00:44:41,311 --> 00:44:42,085
Nine...

467
00:44:46,784 --> 00:44:48,957
Sir, confirming contact
at 2000 meters...

468
00:44:49,053 --> 00:44:52,091
...bearing red 750, center 900.
- Fantastic!

469
00:44:52,456 --> 00:44:53,560
Keep tracking.
- Yes, sir.

470
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:03,944
Devaraj.
- Yes.

471
00:45:07,004 --> 00:45:09,245
The sonar spotting has been done.
2000 meters.

472
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:12,950
We dive 250...7 degree alt bubble.

473
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:15,988
Heading west...and
we torpedo the enemy.

474
00:45:16,814 --> 00:45:17,758
Sir...

475
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:21,453
...we must stay on hold
until our orders don't change.

476
00:45:23,253 --> 00:45:26,598
Rann Vijay Singh doesn't wait
for any orders, and you know that.

477
00:45:28,292 --> 00:45:29,635
The enemy's been spotted...and
he shouldn't be there.

478
00:45:30,194 --> 00:45:31,138
That's my rule.

479
00:45:31,962 --> 00:45:33,873
And everyone on this
submarine follows my rule.

480
00:45:34,164 --> 00:45:36,701
I've been sent here to follow
the Indian Navy's rules, sir.

481
00:45:36,967 --> 00:45:38,037
Not yours.

482
00:45:39,703 --> 00:45:44,049
Look Arjun...this is
no time for class room theory.

483
00:45:44,708 --> 00:45:47,245
Radio's down...enemy
presence has been confirmed.

484
00:45:47,511 --> 00:45:49,650
In such a situation.
It's the captain's call.

485
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:51,450
I am the captain.

486
00:45:53,283 --> 00:45:56,560
It's my call...that we head west.
full speed.

487
00:45:57,855 --> 00:46:00,927
Sir...you're the senior naval officer.

488
00:46:02,226 --> 00:46:05,230
You know that the discipline
of the armed forces is our identity.

489
00:46:06,830 --> 00:46:09,936
That's the difference...
between us and the rogue forces.

490
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:17,174
One small mistake...
can lead to an lndo-Pak war.

491
00:46:17,908 --> 00:46:23,881
And 650 million civilians
will have to pay for it.

492
00:46:26,650 --> 00:46:27,560
And sir...

493
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:31,262
...you cannot fire
without joint orders, sir.

494
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:37,833
Sir. He's right.

495
00:46:39,263 --> 00:46:40,401
According to the rules...

496
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:45,838
<i>...l</i> cannot proceed
without your joint orders.

497
00:46:53,710 --> 00:46:55,815
So you want to play 'rules'?

498
00:46:57,714 --> 00:46:58,590
Fine.

499
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:03,320
You need both our permission
to fire torpedoes, don't you?

500
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:07,268
Yes, sir.
- How sad... Sad!

501
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:14,640
And do I need anyone's
permission...to conduct a drill?

502
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:18,078
No, sir.

503
00:47:19,102 --> 00:47:22,242
Well then...let's dive 250...

504
00:47:22,806 --> 00:47:25,412
malt <i>7</i> degrees, heading west.

505
00:47:25,876 --> 00:47:29,847
Since we've found the enemy.
let's wrap up 'Operation Sea-Sight'.

506
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:33,893
So let's torpedo the enemy.

507
00:47:34,384 --> 00:47:37,729
But Devaraj, I don't want you to be...

508
00:47:37,788 --> 00:47:39,324
What is that you said?

509
00:47:39,823 --> 00:47:41,825
Rogue force...

510
00:47:44,561 --> 00:47:48,976
This is an emergency practice drill.

511
00:47:55,005 --> 00:47:55,847
Yes. sir.

512
00:48:03,247 --> 00:48:06,126
Action stations!
Action stations! Action stations!

513
00:48:06,516 --> 00:48:07,893
This is an emergency drill.

514
00:48:07,951 --> 00:48:09,589
I repeat, this is an emergency drill.

515
00:48:09,686 --> 00:48:11,029
This is an emergency drill.

516
00:48:12,689 --> 00:48:13,997
Dive to 250 meters.

517
00:48:20,931 --> 00:48:22,501
Boat depth 170 meters.

518
00:48:30,707 --> 00:48:31,947
What you're doing isn't right, sir?

519
00:48:34,611 --> 00:48:36,648
I am just following S21 rules.

520
00:48:38,181 --> 00:48:39,592
Taan Singh.
- Sir.

521
00:48:40,684 --> 00:48:43,824
Prepare to launch torpedo, tube no. 1.
- Sir.

522
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:54,602
Key, sir.

523
00:48:55,799 --> 00:48:57,369
Sir, you know this is wrong.

524
00:48:57,935 --> 00:48:59,437
I can only follow rules.

525
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:03,311
And according to the rules.
It's my duty...

526
00:49:03,707 --> 00:49:07,450
...to implement the captain's
orders during a drill.

527
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:12,324
Please.

528
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:22,668
Sir.

529
00:49:42,446 --> 00:49:44,858
Torpedo in tube no.1...
ready to fire, sir.

530
00:49:45,849 --> 00:49:47,157
Depth 240 meters, sir.

531
00:49:54,891 --> 00:49:56,837
Attention all stations.
this is your captain.

532
00:49:57,961 --> 00:49:59,531
Gentlemen.
don't ever forget this moment.

533
00:50:01,098 --> 00:50:02,941
Not every soldier
lives to see this day.

534
00:50:05,268 --> 00:50:06,042
Victory...

535
00:50:07,104 --> 00:50:10,278
Victory is something that
will never be handed to you.

536
00:50:11,742 --> 00:50:13,517
You have to fight for it.

537
00:50:14,111 --> 00:50:16,557
Which is exactly what
we're going to do now.

538
00:50:17,481 --> 00:50:18,459
I know...

539
00:50:20,083 --> 00:50:24,498
...some of you are scared...

540
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:29,360
...wondering whether this is war,
or just a drill.

541
00:50:30,227 --> 00:50:31,900
Think of life as a drill...

542
00:50:32,963 --> 00:50:34,340
...and you won't be scared anymore.

543
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:38,409
So gentlemen, all stations alert.

544
00:50:40,103 --> 00:50:41,514
This is your captain.

545
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:44,575
Over and out!

546
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:52,049
Depth 250 meters, sir.

547
00:50:53,283 --> 00:50:54,227
Get ready...

548
00:50:54,684 --> 00:50:57,164
3...2...1

549
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:07,940
Four...

550
00:51:13,203 --> 00:51:13,977
Five...

551
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:16,581
Six...

552
00:51:17,974 --> 00:51:18,850
Eight...

553
00:51:27,717 --> 00:51:28,718
S***

554
00:51:29,019 --> 00:51:30,657
Sir, torpedo alert.

555
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,131
Red bearing 270 degrees.

556
00:51:34,691 --> 00:51:37,604
Be alert everyone, take positions.
- Yes, sir.

557
00:51:40,997 --> 00:51:42,442
Sir, the torpedo is at 300 meters.

558
00:51:45,735 --> 00:51:46,679
Nine...

559
00:51:52,576 --> 00:51:55,216
But sir, it's not on target.

560
00:52:20,504 --> 00:52:22,745
Navigation, come in.
- Navigation, copy sir.

561
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:25,051
Turn the boat 30 degrees starboard.

562
00:52:25,408 --> 00:52:26,887
Full speed ahead.
- Aye, sir.

563
00:52:38,421 --> 00:52:39,991
Sonar, report contact.

564
00:52:40,891 --> 00:52:43,064
Sir...no contact. sir.

565
00:52:45,095 --> 00:52:47,132
Do they know about our presence?

566
00:52:47,297 --> 00:52:50,176
Why else would they waste a torpedo?

567
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:53,643
How far off was it?

568
00:52:54,037 --> 00:52:55,141
200 meters, sir.

569
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:57,818
That's not far.

570
00:53:00,043 --> 00:53:03,320
This means...someone in
there is racking his brains.

571
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:06,183
Hold same depth.

572
00:53:07,551 --> 00:53:08,757
What's the range of correction?

573
00:53:13,256 --> 00:53:14,166
200 meters, sir.

574
00:53:16,326 --> 00:53:19,899
Maybe the enemy knows...
that we fired a torpedo.

575
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:21,975
We're right behind them!

576
00:53:22,799 --> 00:53:27,145
Which means we can
only see their tail...

577
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:30,112
...that's why we
didn't hit the target.

578
00:53:30,774 --> 00:53:34,312
Now...if we dive 50 meters more.

579
00:53:36,146 --> 00:53:37,853
Somewhere here.

580
00:53:40,083 --> 00:53:43,326
Then our target area
will be...their entire base.

581
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:46,094
And...we knock the enemy off.

582
00:53:47,958 --> 00:53:50,564
And they won't be able to detect us.
- No, sir.

583
00:53:54,097 --> 00:53:55,075
Dive to 300.

584
00:53:57,534 --> 00:53:58,478
300, sir?

585
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:02,945
Yes...300.

586
00:54:07,177 --> 00:54:08,952
Are you sure...
- I am very sure!

587
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:13,022
Devaraj.
- Sir...

588
00:54:13,850 --> 00:54:16,524
I said dive to 300 meters.

589
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:21,133
Yes. sir.

590
00:54:22,959 --> 00:54:24,563
Dive to 300 meters.

591
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:29,934
Sir.
- Dive...to 300 meters.

592
00:54:30,033 --> 00:54:30,943
Aye, sir.

593
00:54:33,737 --> 00:54:35,842
Sir. you're risking everyone's lives.

594
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:40,747
Program torpedo.

595
00:54:46,316 --> 00:54:48,762
Torpedo in tube no. 2...
ready to fire, sir.

596
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:55,668
Depth 260 meters, sir.

597
00:55:16,112 --> 00:55:17,750
Depth 270 meters, sir.

598
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:39,370
Stay away from the pipes.

599
00:55:39,769 --> 00:55:41,612
The bolts can shoot
out due to the pressure.

600
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:53,221
Compartment seven.
leak in auxiliary pipe!

601
00:55:55,452 --> 00:55:56,954
Close alt six and seven vents.

602
00:55:57,220 --> 00:55:58,858
Close alt six and seven vents. - Okay.

603
00:56:08,231 --> 00:56:11,212
Report damage.
Compartment seven, report damage.

604
00:56:26,282 --> 00:56:28,319
Sir, we need to terminate
this drill immediately.

605
00:56:49,973 --> 00:56:51,509
<i>Fire...fire...</i>

606
00:56:53,676 --> 00:56:54,984
Sanjay, be careful.

607
00:57:01,785 --> 00:57:03,162
Continue the dive.

608
00:57:04,954 --> 00:57:08,060
Sir, if you don't immediately
terminate this drill...

609
00:57:08,124 --> 00:57:09,865
...then according
to contingency rules...

610
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:12,869
I'll have to take
over this submarine now.

611
00:57:14,397 --> 00:57:17,003
What? - Yes sir.
and I will act on it immediately.

612
00:57:28,011 --> 00:57:29,183
Surface the boat.

613
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:32,851
The drill has been terminated.

614
00:57:32,949 --> 00:57:34,326
Surfacing the boat.

615
00:57:34,384 --> 00:57:36,489
I repeat.
the drill has been terminated.

616
00:57:36,553 --> 00:57:37,793
Surfacing the boat.

617
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:43,771
I said surface the boat!

618
00:57:44,427 --> 00:57:45,872
I need the captain's orders, sir.

619
00:57:49,933 --> 00:57:51,412
We won't stop diving.

620
00:58:05,181 --> 00:58:06,888
Depth 285 meters.

621
00:58:12,355 --> 00:58:14,858
Continue the dive.
- Go ahead, shoot me.

622
00:58:22,131 --> 00:58:24,634
Sir...the kitchen
is filled with smoke.

623
00:58:24,968 --> 00:58:27,471
We must surface in
order to clear it out.

624
00:58:32,075 --> 00:58:34,385
Sir, we have to surface.
This is an emergency.

625
00:58:34,444 --> 00:58:35,582
Please, sir.

626
00:58:38,081 --> 00:58:38,957
Sir...

627
00:58:39,582 --> 00:58:40,617
Take the boat up.

628
00:58:45,421 --> 00:58:46,957
Alter we clear the smoke...

629
00:58:49,259 --> 00:58:50,431
...we dive, okay.

630
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:03,874
Empty the tanks.
- Aye, sir.

631
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:14,695
Sir, location has been identified.

632
00:59:14,751 --> 00:59:15,923
It's an Indian submarine.

633
00:59:16,419 --> 00:59:18,092
They are 2000 meters away from us.

634
00:59:18,187 --> 00:59:19,894
Bearing green 90 degrees east.

635
00:59:24,227 --> 00:59:27,902
Sir...they are
currently at this point.

636
00:59:28,498 --> 00:59:29,670
And...

637
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:34,538
...we are exactly here. At this point.

638
00:59:38,541 --> 00:59:42,455
And since we're in
Indian naval waters...

639
00:59:42,979 --> 00:59:46,984
...they will definitely come alter us.
through these hills.

640
00:59:47,951 --> 00:59:51,421
You mean...attack.
- Of course.

641
00:59:52,555 --> 00:59:53,829
But not in their style.

642
00:59:55,959 --> 00:59:58,633
Prepare to welcome
our Indian guests...

643
00:59:59,295 --> 01:00:01,070
With the welcome garlands.

644
01:00:02,298 --> 01:00:03,276
Sir...

645
01:00:05,868 --> 01:00:06,972
Bashir Khan.

646
01:00:07,470 --> 01:00:08,505
Sir.

647
01:00:09,539 --> 01:00:11,746
Plant water mines
alongside these hills.

648
01:00:12,375 --> 01:00:14,582
As soon as the Indians get here...

649
01:00:14,911 --> 01:00:16,891
...they will come in
contact with the mines, and...

650
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:18,081
Game over.

651
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:56,652
Everything is fine, sir.

652
01:01:57,613 --> 01:01:58,785
Ready for action, sir.

653
01:01:58,948 --> 01:01:59,688
Yes. sir.

654
01:01:59,782 --> 01:02:01,955
His blood boils faster
than diesel, sir.

655
01:02:05,722 --> 01:02:07,099
You know how to do first aid?

656
01:02:08,424 --> 01:02:09,425
I am a doctor.

657
01:02:23,339 --> 01:02:25,751
Sir, this is our exact position.

658
01:02:25,842 --> 01:02:27,549
If we turn at 80 degrees...
- Sir.

659
01:02:28,544 --> 01:02:30,649
The Indian submarine
is not heading towards us.

660
01:02:33,683 --> 01:02:35,219
And why will they...

661
01:02:36,185 --> 01:02:38,529
You guys arranged
for the welcome wagon...

662
01:02:39,021 --> 01:02:41,092
...but forgot to invite them properly.

663
01:02:44,527 --> 01:02:48,065
Let them know where we are.

664
01:02:48,998 --> 01:02:52,104
Send clear signals.
- Aye, sir.

665
01:03:07,316 --> 01:03:09,159
Sister, lam hungry

666
01:03:14,257 --> 01:03:16,294
She was hungry, so...

667
01:03:16,592 --> 01:03:19,004
Oh...we completely forgot
about the kid in this emergency.

668
01:03:24,066 --> 01:03:25,136
This is for you.

669
01:03:26,435 --> 01:03:27,413
There was only one.

670
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:28,414
Officer.

671
01:03:29,272 --> 01:03:31,718
Thank you, for saving our lives.

672
01:03:35,311 --> 01:03:36,984
This would've never happened...

673
01:03:37,079 --> 01:03:39,923
...if you had firmly told the captain
to follow head-quarter's orders.

674
01:03:41,217 --> 01:03:44,391
Are all political orders right?
- Right or wrong...

675
01:03:44,687 --> 01:03:46,189
...but following them is our duty.

676
01:03:46,556 --> 01:03:49,935
Chandan Singh followed
them too... Orders.

677
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:52,100
The captain's son.

678
01:03:54,030 --> 01:03:57,375
In the '65 war...
he was deputed in the Poonch Sector.

679
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:01,580
They had information
about enemy mobilization.

680
01:04:03,239 --> 01:04:05,719
All the signs indicated
towards an attack at dawn.

681
01:04:07,710 --> 01:04:09,553
Chandan sent message to headquarters.

682
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:11,683
"Let's plan a surprise
attack at night."

683
01:04:12,281 --> 01:04:13,692
He sent messages repeatedly.

684
01:04:14,951 --> 01:04:16,294
But head quarter's reply was...

685
01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:20,032
"No attack...only defense."

686
01:04:22,325 --> 01:04:23,702
Three days later...

687
01:04:25,328 --> 01:04:27,171
...Chandan's dead body came back.

688
01:04:29,532 --> 01:04:31,409
His body was riddled with bullets.

689
01:04:33,669 --> 01:04:36,878
Later...head quarters
also sent medals.

690
01:05:05,368 --> 01:05:06,540
Devaraj!

691
01:05:07,336 --> 01:05:08,178
We won't head back...

692
01:05:08,237 --> 01:05:09,773
...until this Pakistani
submarine isn't destroyed.

693
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:11,341
Sir, we... - And you, officer...

694
01:05:16,145 --> 01:05:17,419
Stop me if you can.

695
01:05:18,247 --> 01:05:19,351
Full speed ahead.
- Sir, the consequences...

696
01:05:19,448 --> 01:05:21,655
lf you point that
gun at the captain...

697
01:05:22,418 --> 01:05:24,694
...then I'll arrest you for mutiny.

698
01:05:26,055 --> 01:05:27,966
I don't care about
getting court-martialled.

699
01:05:29,659 --> 01:05:30,603
Okay?

700
01:05:32,295 --> 01:05:33,740
Full ahead!
- Aye, sir.

701
01:05:43,873 --> 01:05:44,783
Sir...

702
01:05:47,043 --> 01:05:47,987
Check this.

703
01:05:54,984 --> 01:05:57,396
Sonar contact center
900...left 1100, sir.

704
01:06:01,390 --> 01:06:02,733
Follow it, Devaraj.

705
01:06:04,060 --> 01:06:06,062
Let's chase this Pakistani crocodile.

706
01:06:06,862 --> 01:06:07,966
They should not get away.

707
01:06:08,064 --> 01:06:08,974
Sir...

708
01:06:13,135 --> 01:06:14,739
Sir. communication is broken.

709
01:06:16,238 --> 01:06:17,911
We can't even ask
for interim provisions.

710
01:06:19,375 --> 01:06:21,116
We've very little food left.

711
01:06:23,813 --> 01:06:24,848
If we don't eat for a day or two...

712
01:06:24,914 --> 01:06:27,895
...our poor brave soldiers...
will die of hunger, huh!

713
01:07:18,834 --> 01:07:20,336
How long till we reach port?

714
01:07:24,173 --> 01:07:25,345
26 hours, sir.

715
01:07:26,075 --> 01:07:27,486
Let's head back.

716
01:07:29,779 --> 01:07:32,123
Inform base...about the enemy.

717
01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:35,228
Sir...

718
01:07:40,956 --> 01:07:41,957
Attention stations!

719
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:43,036
Attention stations!

720
01:07:43,092 --> 01:07:45,766
Attention stations!
We're heading back to the port.

721
01:07:45,861 --> 01:07:48,364
I repeat.
we're heading back to the port.

722
01:07:49,365 --> 01:07:50,844
Just keep tracking.
- Aye, sir.

723
01:07:53,736 --> 01:07:54,544
Sir...

724
01:07:58,340 --> 01:08:00,251
We were getting echoes
from between these hills.

725
01:08:02,445 --> 01:08:03,423
And later they faded.

726
01:08:03,879 --> 01:08:04,914
It's unusual.

727
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:09,620
And sir, we should
check this point as well.

728
01:08:16,559 --> 01:08:18,561
It'll take us five
hours to get to that point.

729
01:08:19,195 --> 01:08:21,436
And another 26 hours to
get back to port from there.

730
01:08:22,598 --> 01:08:25,579
We've civilians...as
well as a kid on board.

731
01:08:26,702 --> 01:08:28,147
We don't have enough
food supplies for everyone.

732
01:08:32,041 --> 01:08:33,418
Whatever we have is for the civilians.

733
01:08:34,043 --> 01:08:36,182
We won't die if we
don't eat for 31 hours.

734
01:08:43,319 --> 01:08:44,992
When did he start
speaking our language?

735
01:08:51,594 --> 01:08:53,835
Are you sure?
- Sir, positive.

736
01:08:57,833 --> 01:08:58,675
And sir...

737
01:08:59,635 --> 01:09:02,912
...captain's gun.
should remain with the captain.

738
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:26,499
Sir, we should get echoes
from port or starboard...

739
01:09:26,962 --> 01:09:28,236
...when we pass through the hills.

740
01:09:28,330 --> 01:09:29,638
But we're getting
from the center instead.

741
01:09:34,336 --> 01:09:35,371
Damn...

742
01:09:39,041 --> 01:09:41,043
Devaraj...there are mines.

743
01:09:41,210 --> 01:09:42,917
It's a trap, change course.

744
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:45,420
Tiwari, change of course,
immediately. Come on.

745
01:09:45,514 --> 01:09:46,390
Yes. sir.

746
01:11:21,877 --> 01:11:23,117
Yes...

747
01:11:23,679 --> 01:11:24,885
Sir, mine impact!

748
01:11:24,980 --> 01:11:26,891
X 30, bearing green 45...center 70.

749
01:11:26,982 --> 01:11:29,326
Yes! Yes!
- Hold on.

750
01:11:32,621 --> 01:11:34,794
Sonar...please confirm whether...

751
01:11:34,857 --> 01:11:36,859
...the Indian submarine':
been completely destroyed, or not.

752
01:12:30,612 --> 01:12:31,647
What happened?

753
01:12:32,114 --> 01:12:34,424
This device can locate
till the depth of 300 meters.

754
01:12:34,483 --> 01:12:36,326
And there's nothing till that depth.

755
01:12:36,452 --> 01:12:38,125
Confirmed, there's no signal.

756
01:12:38,220 --> 01:12:40,131
The Indian Submarine has sunk.

757
01:12:40,923 --> 01:12:44,700
Congratulations, sir.
- This is the just the beginning.

758
01:12:46,061 --> 01:12:50,510
The conclusion will
be when Visakhapatnam...

759
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:53,874
"disappears from
the face of India's map.

760
01:12:56,071 --> 01:12:58,642
Long live Pakistan!

761
01:12:59,141 --> 01:13:02,247
Long live Pakistan!

762
01:13:40,449 --> 01:13:41,484
Getup.

763
01:13:42,151 --> 01:13:45,098
Come on ...stand up.

764
01:13:46,188 --> 01:13:47,997
Careful...
It's alright...it's alright.

765
01:13:50,192 --> 01:13:51,262
Are you fine? - Yes, sir.

766
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:52,964
Take him to the cabin.
- Okay, sir.

767
01:14:24,593 --> 01:14:25,469
We must close the hatch.

768
01:14:36,371 --> 01:14:37,873
Sir, come out...quickly.

769
01:14:39,041 --> 01:14:40,645
This torpedo propeller
must be stopped"

770
01:14:40,742 --> 01:14:42,312
...otherwise the
submarine will blow up.

771
01:15:12,107 --> 01:15:13,450
Close the hatch, quickly.

772
01:15:14,943 --> 01:15:15,819
We must do something, quickly.

773
01:15:15,911 --> 01:15:17,913
The torpedo': been fixed...
but the water isn't stopping.

774
01:15:21,250 --> 01:15:23,093
Come on. come on. come boys.
We've no time.

775
01:15:25,521 --> 01:15:26,864
Yeah...go on.

776
01:15:29,658 --> 01:15:31,899
Good. Now remove the jack.

777
01:15:43,038 --> 01:15:46,986
Multiple injuries. Deep incisive
wound in the left shoulder.

778
01:15:48,810 --> 01:15:51,347
We need to wait until
the anesthesia kicks in.

779
01:15:53,015 --> 01:15:53,993
Is he fine?

780
01:15:56,785 --> 01:15:59,766
Arjun ...now you're in command.

781
01:16:02,090 --> 01:16:03,433
The entire submarine...

782
01:16:09,364 --> 01:16:10,342
Sir...

783
01:16:10,899 --> 01:16:12,503
Most of the batteries are damaged.

784
01:16:12,568 --> 01:16:13,876
The pressure pumps are broken as well.

785
01:16:13,936 --> 01:16:16,109
And the battery room
is still filled with water.

786
01:16:18,540 --> 01:16:20,486
Get me the S21's blue prints.

787
01:16:28,684 --> 01:16:31,631
We'll use the ballast pumps...4-7th.

788
01:16:32,220 --> 01:16:33,494
We'll flush out the water
from every compartment...

789
01:16:33,589 --> 01:16:34,966
...through the torpedo tube.

790
01:16:35,123 --> 01:16:36,466
Pump the water outwith high pressure.

791
01:16:36,558 --> 01:16:37,764
Go-go-go.
- Yes, sir.

792
01:16:48,370 --> 01:16:49,508
Quickly-quickly. Here...

793
01:16:49,938 --> 01:16:50,780
Move-move..

794
01:16:50,939 --> 01:16:51,940
Guys, hurry up.

795
01:16:55,177 --> 01:16:56,588
Quickly-quickly.

796
01:17:27,109 --> 01:17:28,019
Sir.

797
01:17:28,443 --> 01:17:30,650
Still no contact with S-21.

798
01:18:07,082 --> 01:18:10,086
Sir...only two battery
units are working.

799
01:18:10,519 --> 01:18:13,500
How long will they last?
- Hardly 20-25 minutes.

800
01:18:13,655 --> 01:18:15,566
Alter that only the
emergency lights will work.

801
01:18:16,358 --> 01:18:19,669
And sir, the port's propeller
is dislodged as well.

802
01:18:20,195 --> 01:18:21,868
Means we can't go back or forth, sir.

803
01:18:24,666 --> 01:18:26,270
But we can go up using
the compressed gas.

804
01:18:26,501 --> 01:18:27,980
Blow all the ballast tanks.
- Sir.

805
01:18:41,783 --> 01:18:43,285
Apply emergency pressure.

806
01:19:23,458 --> 01:19:25,529
Yes...
- One moment guys, wait.

807
01:19:30,899 --> 01:19:32,503
380 meters.

808
01:19:37,506 --> 01:19:38,883
360 meters.

809
01:19:47,783 --> 01:19:48,887
350 meters.

810
01:19:52,654 --> 01:19:53,655
340 meters.

811
01:19:57,492 --> 01:19:58,527
330 meters.

812
01:20:02,798 --> 01:20:03,902
300 meters.

813
01:20:04,666 --> 01:20:06,771
Yes...come on.

814
01:20:07,002 --> 01:20:09,539
Check for mines.
- Aye, sir.

815
01:20:19,881 --> 01:20:20,791
Has the radio been fixed?

816
01:20:21,883 --> 01:20:22,793
Everything': fine in here, sir.

817
01:20:22,884 --> 01:20:24,124
Maybe there's a problem
with the antenna.

818
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:34,362
Sir...another mine.

819
01:20:34,462 --> 01:20:36,738
40 degrees starboard, 15 degrees...
170 meters depth.

820
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:40,141
15 degrees starboard...

821
01:20:41,870 --> 01:20:45,181
15 degrees starboard...means
it's not on our path.

822
01:20:45,473 --> 01:20:47,817
We can go up.
- Aye, sir.

823
01:20:50,846 --> 01:20:52,826
Officer. Devaraj is conscious.

824
01:20:59,955 --> 01:21:01,195
Things are in control now.

825
01:21:03,859 --> 01:21:05,202
But there's bad news.

826
01:21:06,828 --> 01:21:09,968
Our captain...
- I know.

827
01:21:13,034 --> 01:21:14,069
I saw.

828
01:21:21,009 --> 01:21:22,283
He gave us his life...

829
01:21:24,145 --> 01:21:25,647
...while trying to save yours.

830
01:21:46,735 --> 01:21:47,907
We must bid him farewell.

831
01:22:04,819 --> 01:22:11,065
"He who utters the name of Lord..."

832
01:22:11,126 --> 01:22:14,733
"...rises victorious."

833
01:22:15,363 --> 01:22:20,108
"He who utters the name of Lord..."

834
01:22:20,302 --> 01:22:23,681
"...rises victorious."

835
01:22:24,372 --> 01:22:28,514
"He who utters the name of Lord..."

836
01:22:29,678 --> 01:22:33,251
"...rises victorious."

837
01:22:33,515 --> 01:22:38,487
"He who utters the name of Lord..."

838
01:22:38,553 --> 01:22:42,057
"...rises victorious."

839
01:22:42,157 --> 01:22:46,401
"He who utters the name of Lord..."

840
01:22:47,696 --> 01:22:51,041
"...rises victorious."

841
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:54,906
"Praise our Lord!"
"Praise our Lord!"

842
01:22:55,003 --> 01:22:57,847
"Praise our Lord!"
"Praise our Lord!"

843
01:22:58,506 --> 01:23:01,680
"Praise our Lord!"
"Praise our Lord!"

844
01:23:01,743 --> 01:23:04,815
"Praise our Lord!"
"Praise our Lord!"

845
01:23:05,213 --> 01:23:08,217
"Praise our Lord!"
"Praise our Lord!"

846
01:23:08,316 --> 01:23:12,128
"Praise our Lord!"
"Praise our Lord!"

847
01:23:12,187 --> 01:23:18,035
"Praise our Lord!"
"Praise our Lord!"

848
01:23:18,126 --> 01:23:24,168
"Praise our Lord!"
"Praise our Lord!"

849
01:23:25,100 --> 01:23:27,478
"He who is pure at heart..."

850
01:23:27,836 --> 01:23:29,838
"...will attain victory."

851
01:23:29,938 --> 01:23:31,975
"He who is pure at heart..."

852
01:23:32,140 --> 01:23:34,279
"...will attain victory."

853
01:24:40,041 --> 01:24:42,248
He wanted to bury
the enemy in the sea.

854
01:24:44,679 --> 01:24:48,650
But now...he belongs
to the sea instead.

855
01:25:24,018 --> 01:25:25,497
Attention stations.

856
01:25:26,454 --> 01:25:28,297
This is Lt. Commander Arjun Varma.

857
01:25:34,129 --> 01:25:37,133
Capt. Rann Vijay Singh
was a proud Indian soldier.

858
01:25:38,766 --> 01:25:41,770
He knew what it means to be a soldier.

859
01:25:42,971 --> 01:25:44,245
What does it mean to be a soldier?

860
01:25:46,074 --> 01:25:47,644
The farmers of our nation...

861
01:25:47,742 --> 01:25:51,747
...are growing crops in their fields.
without any fear.

862
01:25:52,413 --> 01:25:53,391
Why?

863
01:25:53,715 --> 01:25:56,252
Because he knows...that
we stand guard at the border.

864
01:25:57,285 --> 01:26:01,290
At dawn, mothers happily
take her kids to school.

865
01:26:02,323 --> 01:26:04,132
She has not fear.

866
01:26:04,926 --> 01:26:05,802
Why?

867
01:26:05,860 --> 01:26:08,773
Because he knows...that
we stand guard at the border.

868
01:26:10,098 --> 01:26:14,171
Every resident of this
nation...works hard every day.

869
01:26:15,436 --> 01:26:17,143
For the future of his family.

870
01:26:17,572 --> 01:26:19,142
For the progress of his children.

871
01:26:20,708 --> 01:26:22,710
He's never worried about their safety.

872
01:26:23,144 --> 01:26:24,248
Why?

873
01:26:24,679 --> 01:26:26,784
Because he knows...
that we stand guard at the border.

874
01:26:26,881 --> 01:26:28,053
...and we always will.

875
01:26:29,083 --> 01:26:32,690
Keeping this faith alive...
that's what being a soldier means.

876
01:26:34,722 --> 01:26:36,395
Remember what the captain always said.

877
01:26:36,958 --> 01:26:41,031
Battles are won by slaying the enemy.

878
01:26:43,164 --> 01:26:45,405
This is the moment to
give his sacrifice a meaning.

879
01:26:47,135 --> 01:26:48,512
The enemy's right in front of <i>us...</i>

880
01:26:48,836 --> 01:26:50,543
...and he's got his
eyes on our country.

881
01:26:51,606 --> 01:26:53,017
He wants to step on our pride...

882
01:26:53,107 --> 01:26:54,950
...and set foot in our country.

883
01:26:55,944 --> 01:26:57,981
Will we let it happen?
- No, sir.

884
01:26:58,146 --> 01:27:00,217
We won't let anyone go back.

885
01:27:01,049 --> 01:27:02,926
We'll bury them right here, sir.

886
01:27:03,685 --> 01:27:05,528
Even their dead bodies won't go back.

887
01:27:05,587 --> 01:27:07,533
We'll bury each one
of them in the water.

888
01:27:07,589 --> 01:27:08,897
We're with you, sir.

889
01:27:08,990 --> 01:27:12,437
We won't go back without
avenging our captain's death, sir.

890
01:27:13,928 --> 01:27:15,635
This mission is classified.

891
01:27:17,165 --> 01:27:19,042
We won't get recognition or medals.

892
01:27:20,735 --> 01:27:22,544
Whether history remembers US.
or not...

893
01:27:23,004 --> 01:27:25,610
...but we'll be a
part of India's future.

894
01:27:27,709 --> 01:27:28,449
Jai Hind!

895
01:27:28,509 --> 01:27:29,510
Jai Hind!

896
01:27:29,711 --> 01:27:30,689
Jai Hind!

897
01:27:30,778 --> 01:27:32,086
Jai Hind!

898
01:27:32,146 --> 01:27:33,523
Jai Hind!

899
01:27:33,615 --> 01:27:35,117
Jai Hind!

900
01:27:35,183 --> 01:27:36,321
Jai Hind!

901
01:27:36,417 --> 01:27:37,919
Jai Hind!

902
01:27:38,253 --> 01:27:39,630
Jai Hind!

903
01:27:41,856 --> 01:27:43,130
Sir.

904
01:27:43,658 --> 01:27:45,137
You're senior to officer Arjun.

905
01:27:45,460 --> 01:27:46,803
You should be in command.

906
01:27:50,098 --> 01:27:54,308
Jadhav. That's not our job to decide.

907
01:27:54,569 --> 01:27:57,106
Dismissed.
- Sorry, sir...but I can't follow this.

908
01:27:57,405 --> 01:27:58,975
You know this submarine better.

909
01:27:59,507 --> 01:28:01,612
You've been with our captain longer...
- Jadhav, dismissed.

910
01:28:01,676 --> 01:28:02,677
Sorry, sir.

911
01:28:05,346 --> 01:28:09,692
Headquarters has designated
officer Arjun with special powers.

912
01:28:10,485 --> 01:28:11,691
It's an order.

913
01:28:12,153 --> 01:28:13,757
I accept him as my captain.

914
01:28:14,289 --> 01:28:16,132
And so will you.

915
01:28:17,592 --> 01:28:19,731
I won't tolerate this
insubordination again.

916
01:28:21,296 --> 01:28:22,798
Is that clear?
- Yes, sir.

917
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:27,045
Dismissed.
- Sir.

918
01:28:34,042 --> 01:28:35,885
Our submarine can only go up and down.

919
01:28:36,277 --> 01:28:37,722
How will we follow them?

920
01:28:37,812 --> 01:28:39,758
We'll use their mines on them...

921
01:28:39,847 --> 01:28:42,157
...and they will come
looking for us. - Sir.

922
01:28:42,317 --> 01:28:44,422
This is our submarine.
200 meters depth.

923
01:28:44,886 --> 01:28:47,332
This is the position
of the mine...170 meters.

924
01:28:47,622 --> 01:28:49,898
We've to reach 170 meters
and destroy this mine.

925
01:28:50,558 --> 01:28:54,028
And the enemy...will
come back on this line.

926
01:28:54,329 --> 01:28:55,637
To confirm the damage.

927
01:28:55,830 --> 01:28:57,434
And this is our torpedo': position.

928
01:28:57,832 --> 01:28:59,277
They will be within our firing range.

929
01:29:00,001 --> 01:29:01,844
But sir, we can't wait for too long.

930
01:29:02,370 --> 01:29:03,906
Only two batteries are functioning...

931
01:29:04,005 --> 01:29:05,746
...and the torpedoes
won't launch without power.

932
01:29:06,107 --> 01:29:08,883
We'll generate compressed
air manually and fire the torpedoes.

933
01:29:09,844 --> 01:29:11,221
Depth 200 meters.

934
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:13,525
Depth 190 meters.

935
01:29:14,749 --> 01:29:16,057
180 meters.

936
01:29:17,885 --> 01:29:19,387
170 meters.
- Hold.

937
01:29:22,790 --> 01:29:23,825
Holding, sir.

938
01:29:33,768 --> 01:29:35,907
Compartment seven...crew alert.

939
01:29:36,170 --> 01:29:37,240
Hit it

940
01:30:10,838 --> 01:30:13,842
Attention crew...on
the count of three.

941
01:30:14,375 --> 01:30:17,288
One...Mo...three...

942
01:30:17,812 --> 01:30:19,553
Hum!- Hum!

943
01:30:20,381 --> 01:30:21,655
Hum!

944
01:30:22,383 --> 01:30:23,794
Hum!

945
01:30:24,218 --> 01:30:25,492
Hum!

946
01:30:30,691 --> 01:30:32,034
Hum!

947
01:30:32,593 --> 01:30:33,901
Hum!

948
01:30:38,399 --> 01:30:39,469
Hum!

949
01:30:40,435 --> 01:30:41,470
Hum!

950
01:30:42,470 --> 01:30:43,608
Hum!

951
01:30:44,439 --> 01:30:45,474
Hum!

952
01:30:46,574 --> 01:30:47,917
Hum!

953
01:30:48,409 --> 01:30:49,581
Hum!

954
01:30:52,613 --> 01:30:53,557
Hum!

955
01:30:55,349 --> 01:30:56,453
Hum!

956
01:30:57,752 --> 01:30:58,992
Hum!

957
01:31:23,611 --> 01:31:24,919
Sir, another mine blast...

958
01:31:24,979 --> 01:31:26,720
But within 20 minutes?

959
01:31:32,086 --> 01:31:37,058
That means the Indian submarine
wasn't completely destroyed.

960
01:31:38,726 --> 01:31:41,332
Sir...shall we go
check the submarine...

961
01:31:41,662 --> 01:31:43,699
...or keep heading
towards Visakhapatnam?

962
01:31:46,834 --> 01:31:48,711
That's always been the problem.

963
01:31:49,203 --> 01:31:53,117
Which bug do we crush first?

964
01:32:03,417 --> 01:32:04,657
Will they come?

965
01:32:06,354 --> 01:32:07,355
Don't know.

966
01:32:33,080 --> 01:32:34,252
Yes...

967
01:32:35,182 --> 01:32:36,786
Sir. sonar contact.

968
01:32:38,119 --> 01:32:39,393
Position.

969
01:32:39,787 --> 01:32:41,960
Port 265 degrees west.
center 900, sir.

970
01:32:43,257 --> 01:32:45,066
Program torpedo.
- Aye, sir.

971
01:32:54,235 --> 01:32:55,077
Centre 900.

972
01:33:00,041 --> 01:33:01,315
Centre 865.

973
01:33:03,344 --> 01:33:04,254
Centre 850.

974
01:33:06,948 --> 01:33:07,756
It's not too far.

975
01:33:16,624 --> 01:33:17,625
Centre 800, sir.

976
01:33:19,594 --> 01:33:21,096
You were right.
- 780.

977
01:33:21,295 --> 01:33:22,968
They are coming in our firing line.

978
01:33:23,464 --> 01:33:26,570
Let them come till 700, sir.
It will be a sure shot.

979
01:33:40,648 --> 01:33:43,060
If the second mine
blast was a trick...

980
01:33:44,719 --> 01:33:46,528
...then they must be waiting for us.

981
01:33:48,022 --> 01:33:49,524
And first rule of war...

982
01:33:50,391 --> 01:33:52,496
...never follow the expected line.

983
01:33:52,994 --> 01:33:54,667
XO.
- Sir.

984
01:33:55,696 --> 01:33:57,607
Turn starboard 80 degrees southeast.

985
01:34:16,751 --> 01:34:19,163
Sir...they changed course.

986
01:34:20,321 --> 01:34:21,823
New coordinates, Port 280 degrees.

987
01:34:23,057 --> 01:34:24,297
Port 270 degrees.

988
01:34:25,226 --> 01:34:26,500
Port 260 degrees.

989
01:34:27,495 --> 01:34:28,496
Port 250 degrees.

990
01:34:29,497 --> 01:34:30,498
Port 240 degrees.

991
01:34:37,638 --> 01:34:39,743
This is their approach line.
- 200 degrees, sir.

992
01:34:39,807 --> 01:34:41,343
Meaning they are not
approaching directly.

993
01:34:41,442 --> 01:34:42,284
180 degrees...

994
01:34:42,943 --> 01:34:45,719
The angle of our torpedo
is fixed because we cannot turn.

995
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:48,756
And now the enemy is
outside our firing angle.

996
01:34:49,083 --> 01:34:52,530
But the problem is...
now we're in their firing range.

997
01:35:06,600 --> 01:35:10,275
Sir, the Indian submarine
is at 650 meters... but not moving.

998
01:35:10,838 --> 01:35:13,079
Load torpedo in tube 1.
- Yes, sir.

999
01:35:15,076 --> 01:35:17,147
Compartment seven.
load torpedo in tube 1.

1000
01:35:25,853 --> 01:35:29,130
Program torpedo.
- Sir, programming torpedo.

1001
01:35:34,929 --> 01:35:36,931
Torpedo in tube one...programmed, sir.

1002
01:35:39,667 --> 01:35:40,611
Shoot!

1003
01:35:51,545 --> 01:35:52,683
S***

1004
01:35:53,647 --> 01:35:56,025
Sir, they've launched torpedo, sir.

1005
01:35:56,283 --> 01:35:57,694
Bearing red 50 center 250.

1006
01:35:58,352 --> 01:35:59,695
Dive to 190 immediately.

1007
01:36:00,421 --> 01:36:02,025
Dive to 190 meters.
- Aye, sir.

1008
01:36:02,189 --> 01:36:03,031
Diving to 190 meters.

1009
01:36:03,090 --> 01:36:04,262
Quick! Quick! Quick!

1010
01:36:11,398 --> 01:36:12,877
Impact in 600 meters.

1011
01:36:16,737 --> 01:36:17,875
550 meters.

1012
01:36:25,946 --> 01:36:27,016
450 meters, sir.

1013
01:36:41,662 --> 01:36:42,640
300 meters.

1014
01:37:03,617 --> 01:37:05,858
Sir...sir...80 meters.

1015
01:37:24,271 --> 01:37:27,150
Sir, the torpedo missed us.

1016
01:37:35,749 --> 01:37:38,127
Sir, the torpedo missed.

1017
01:37:41,255 --> 01:37:42,529
<i>Bas****,</i>

1018
01:37:43,824 --> 01:37:45,929
What is their current depth?
- 200 meters, sir.

1019
01:37:46,060 --> 01:37:47,300
And still diving down.

1020
01:37:48,963 --> 01:37:51,204
Bashir, come in.
- Bashir, copying sir.

1021
01:37:51,432 --> 01:37:52,968
Launch two torpedoes.

1022
01:37:54,034 --> 01:37:57,208
Depth 210 and 260 meters, over.

1023
01:38:03,844 --> 01:38:04,914
<i>Oh S***</i>

1024
01:38:05,112 --> 01:38:08,093
Sir, torpedo.
Bearing red 40...center 21 O, sir.

1025
01:38:09,049 --> 01:38:09,959
Sir, our depth?

1026
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:13,698
Fine. we can dive.

1027
01:38:22,930 --> 01:38:24,637
Sir, they've launched another torpedo.

1028
01:38:25,199 --> 01:38:26,507
Bearing red 40 center 260.

1029
01:38:26,567 --> 01:38:28,069
It's at a variation of 50 meters.

1030
01:38:29,670 --> 01:38:31,946
Reverse direction.
Take the submarine up, at 150.

1031
01:38:32,373 --> 01:38:33,613
Sir. only one pressure
unit is working.

1032
01:38:33,674 --> 01:38:34,812
It will take us time to go up.

1033
01:38:34,875 --> 01:38:36,855
We don't have a choice, Jadhav.
Just do it.

1034
01:38:37,244 --> 01:38:38,086
Yes. sir.

1035
01:38:58,232 --> 01:38:59,905
Impact distance 550 meters.

1036
01:39:24,658 --> 01:39:25,898
Sir. submarine is rising up.

1037
01:39:26,327 --> 01:39:27,362
Up-up-up...

1038
01:39:30,230 --> 01:39:31,709
Sir, they are heading upwards.

1039
01:39:31,765 --> 01:39:34,439
But our first torpedo
at 210 meters...on target.

1040
01:39:40,374 --> 01:39:41,546
150 meters.

1041
01:40:06,667 --> 01:40:08,772
Sir...the torpedoes missed.

1042
01:40:08,836 --> 01:40:09,906
Yes.

1043
01:40:23,784 --> 01:40:27,891
Sir...both the torpedoes missed.

1044
01:40:34,661 --> 01:40:35,537
What's the depth?

1045
01:40:35,829 --> 01:40:38,673
170 meters.
sir...but they are still going up.

1046
01:40:39,767 --> 01:40:40,677
It's the right direction...

1047
01:40:42,403 --> 01:40:43,882
That's exactly where
I want to send them.

1048
01:40:47,374 --> 01:40:48,216
Okay...

1049
01:40:49,543 --> 01:40:50,647
Pakistan

1050
01:40:51,979 --> 01:40:53,014
India...

1051
01:40:54,181 --> 01:40:56,183
They are at 170...

1052
01:40:57,317 --> 01:40:59,160
And if they keep going
up at the same rate...

1053
01:41:00,687 --> 01:41:03,133
...then they will go maximum at 150.

1054
01:41:03,957 --> 01:41:05,027
Torpedo one.

1055
01:41:05,692 --> 01:41:09,162
And if they ascend at
full speed...then 100 meters.

1056
01:41:10,731 --> 01:41:11,903
Torpedo two.

1057
01:41:12,199 --> 01:41:14,770
And if they reverse their
direction and dive instead.

1058
01:41:16,203 --> 01:41:21,084
Then they cannot escape
the speed of our third torpedo.

1059
01:41:21,341 --> 01:41:25,881
We'll hit the Indian submarine
at a depth of 200 meters.

1060
01:41:26,513 --> 01:41:27,548
Game over.

1061
01:41:28,682 --> 01:41:32,152
Launch torpedoes from tube 4, 5 and 6

1062
01:41:32,419 --> 01:41:33,295
Sir.

1063
01:41:34,121 --> 01:41:35,429
Compartment seven!

1064
01:41:35,622 --> 01:41:36,760
Compartment seven!

1065
01:41:47,134 --> 01:41:47,805
Sir...

1066
01:41:49,203 --> 01:41:50,580
They've launched three torpedoes.

1067
01:41:51,105 --> 01:41:53,016
Depth 100, 150, 200, sir.

1068
01:41:59,613 --> 01:42:00,353
Dammit.

1069
01:42:07,421 --> 01:42:08,832
Dive to 125 and hold.

1070
01:42:13,127 --> 01:42:15,471
It's very close...anything can happen.

1071
01:42:25,772 --> 01:42:27,308
Impact in 350 meters.

1072
01:42:33,881 --> 01:42:35,360
Sir, depth 125 meters.

1073
01:42:39,253 --> 01:42:41,563
Sir, they stopped at 125 meters depth.

1074
01:42:45,726 --> 01:42:47,171
Impact in 250 meters.

1075
01:42:47,728 --> 01:42:50,072
All compartments, hold for impact.

1076
01:42:54,568 --> 01:42:55,308
200 meters.

1077
01:42:55,369 --> 01:42:56,313
Hold for support.

1078
01:43:04,578 --> 01:43:05,886
Alright boys, hold.

1079
01:43:08,048 --> 01:43:09,026
100 meters.

1080
01:43:48,222 --> 01:43:49,929
Sir, all three torpedoes missed.

1081
01:44:01,335 --> 01:44:04,179
Sir...all three torpedoes missed.

1082
01:44:08,842 --> 01:44:10,822
Up-down-up-down...

1083
01:44:10,911 --> 01:44:12,948
ls he a commander or a bloody liftman?

1084
01:44:19,886 --> 01:44:21,092
Well done.

1085
01:44:22,656 --> 01:44:23,896
Hold on...hold on, guys.

1086
01:44:26,960 --> 01:44:28,132
This is not over, yet.

1087
01:44:30,297 --> 01:44:32,709
All compartments.
report for damage if any.

1088
01:44:33,467 --> 01:44:35,105
Compartment 2, okay sir.

1089
01:44:35,836 --> 01:44:37,577
Compartment 4 okay sir.

1090
01:44:37,904 --> 01:44:39,884
Compartment 5, okay sir.

1091
01:44:40,207 --> 01:44:42,050
Compartment 6, okay sir.

1092
01:44:42,276 --> 01:44:43,983
Compartment 7, okay sir.

1093
01:44:46,079 --> 01:44:48,252
Alright boys, listen up.
This isn't over yet.

1094
01:44:48,348 --> 01:44:49,258
We're still at war.

1095
01:44:49,750 --> 01:44:51,195
We're diving to 350, sir.

1096
01:44:52,286 --> 01:44:53,890
They cannot locate us at that depth.

1097
01:44:54,855 --> 01:44:58,359
Arjun...350 meters means the seabed.

1098
01:44:59,026 --> 01:45:00,869
The battery unit can fail at any time.

1099
01:45:02,129 --> 01:45:04,109
I hope you're aware of that.
- Sir.

1100
01:45:18,512 --> 01:45:20,321
Sir, Indian submarine diving.

1101
01:45:22,416 --> 01:45:23,656
250 meters.

1102
01:45:26,119 --> 01:45:27,154
260 meters.

1103
01:45:42,502 --> 01:45:43,640
300, sir.

1104
01:45:48,508 --> 01:45:49,680
They are still diving...

1105
01:46:29,783 --> 01:46:30,955
Depth 350 meters, sir.

1106
01:46:56,176 --> 01:46:59,988
Sir...all our alt
torpedoes are exhausted.

1107
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:03,086
We must turn around
at 180 to launch again.

1108
01:47:04,151 --> 01:47:05,186
Engines off...

1109
01:47:06,420 --> 01:47:08,559
...we wait and watch.
- Yes, sir.

1110
01:47:08,688 --> 01:47:09,564
Engines off.

1111
01:47:10,290 --> 01:47:11,735
Engines off.
- Yes.

1112
01:47:16,430 --> 01:47:19,104
Arjun, I think they know
that we can't move back and forth.

1113
01:47:19,433 --> 01:47:20,776
Only upwards and downwards.

1114
01:47:21,635 --> 01:47:23,911
It will be difficult to
get them in our firing line now.

1115
01:47:28,041 --> 01:47:29,179
Enemy position.

1116
01:47:31,144 --> 01:47:33,954
150 meters depth.
their engines are off.

1117
01:47:36,483 --> 01:47:39,089
Sir, they've exhausted
their Wont torpedoes.

1118
01:47:39,352 --> 01:47:41,195
And in order to attack
us with the rear torpedoes...

1119
01:47:41,455 --> 01:47:43,298
...they must make a 180 degree turn.

1120
01:47:43,490 --> 01:47:46,994
In this line...they
will be in our firing range.

1121
01:47:47,160 --> 01:47:48,468
We can take a clear shot.

1122
01:47:51,998 --> 01:47:53,602
There's another possibility, Arjun.

1123
01:47:54,301 --> 01:47:58,113
What if they take a 180 degree
turn on starboard and come here?

1124
01:47:59,105 --> 01:48:03,315
Then...we'll have to fire from first
compartment, which isn't possible.

1125
01:48:03,977 --> 01:48:05,615
That compartment is filled with water.

1126
01:48:06,046 --> 01:48:06,888
We...

1127
01:48:07,113 --> 01:48:10,117
Sir, we're running out
of power-supply and oxygen.

1128
01:48:15,989 --> 01:48:21,302
Arjun...we've very...little time left.

1129
01:48:23,730 --> 01:48:25,573
We know that, but they don't.

1130
01:48:34,307 --> 01:48:37,413
Any movement?
- No, sir. Still engines are off.

1131
01:50:02,028 --> 01:50:03,735
The British were right about them.

1132
01:50:03,930 --> 01:50:05,637
These Indians!

1133
01:51:02,789 --> 01:51:05,167
Long live...
- Mother India!

1134
01:51:05,225 --> 01:51:07,330
Long live...
- Mother India!

1135
01:51:07,427 --> 01:51:09,634
Long live...
- Mother India!

1136
01:51:10,797 --> 01:51:12,299
What is their depth?

1137
01:51:13,299 --> 01:51:15,074
350 meters, sir.

1138
01:51:15,969 --> 01:51:18,575
Enough of this hide-n-seek.

1139
01:51:18,638 --> 01:51:20,345
Program the forward torpedoes.

1140
01:51:20,440 --> 01:51:22,317
Programming forward torpedoes, sir.

1141
01:51:22,409 --> 01:51:25,549
Turn the boat 180 degrees starboard, now.
- Aye, sir.

1142
01:51:25,612 --> 01:51:27,250
Turning 180 degrees starboard.

1143
01:51:27,547 --> 01:51:29,652
Before they can think of anything...

1144
01:51:30,250 --> 01:51:34,130
...we'll tilt the boat at 20 degrees
and attack from front. - Sir.

1145
01:51:34,220 --> 01:51:34,721
Head on.

1146
01:51:43,430 --> 01:51:46,070
Sir, they are turning...180 starboard.

1147
01:51:47,367 --> 01:51:48,368
Sir, you were right.

1148
01:51:48,468 --> 01:51:49,378
180 starboard.

1149
01:51:49,469 --> 01:51:51,574
Surface the boat.
- Surface the boat immediately.

1150
01:51:51,671 --> 01:51:54,652
Program forward torpedoes.
- Forward torpedoes?

1151
01:51:55,175 --> 01:51:56,415
But how will we launch them?

1152
01:52:00,613 --> 01:52:02,149
No, Arjun.
- Yes, sir.

1153
01:52:04,250 --> 01:52:05,456
Alright boys, hurry up.

1154
01:52:12,025 --> 01:52:13,868
Program forward torpedoes.
- Sir.

1155
01:52:20,333 --> 01:52:22,404
Sir, Indian submarine
rising very fast.

1156
01:52:23,536 --> 01:52:25,675
Reprogram torpedo to our depth, quick!

1157
01:52:25,739 --> 01:52:27,480
Reprogramming torpedo, sir.

1158
01:52:27,841 --> 01:52:30,344
Move fast,
take firing position quickly.

1159
01:52:30,410 --> 01:52:32,014
On the double.

1160
01:52:32,112 --> 01:52:33,056
Come on, fast.

1161
01:52:33,146 --> 01:52:34,216
Taan Singh, hurry up.

1162
01:52:34,447 --> 01:52:35,721
Torpedo, programmed sir.

1163
01:52:37,050 --> 01:52:38,188
Depth 300 meters.

1164
01:52:48,828 --> 01:52:50,000
Boys, quickly.

1165
01:52:51,064 --> 01:52:51,667
Kamlakar.
- Sir.

1166
01:52:51,765 --> 01:52:52,766
Close the hatch immediately.

1167
01:52:52,832 --> 01:52:54,505
But, sir. - Don't open
it before we reach the surface.

1168
01:52:54,901 --> 01:52:55,879
250 meters.

1169
01:52:55,935 --> 01:52:57,107
Sir, rising...

1170
01:52:57,170 --> 01:52:58,979
In two minutes we'll be
at the same depth as the enemy.

1171
01:52:59,072 --> 01:53:00,676
Sir, if you stay inside...your
life can be in danger.

1172
01:53:00,740 --> 01:53:02,014
Without that...
this submarine won't make it.

1173
01:53:02,075 --> 01:53:04,612
Open the hatch.
Come, quick-quick-quick.

1174
01:53:53,026 --> 01:53:54,699
Ready to shoot, sir.
- Shoot!

1175
01:54:02,735 --> 01:54:03,440
S***

1176
01:54:03,970 --> 01:54:05,278
Enemy has launched torpedo, sir.

1177
01:54:36,302 --> 01:54:38,373
Sir...the enemy has launched torpedo.

1178
01:55:31,157 --> 01:55:32,158
Yes.

1179
01:55:32,258 --> 01:55:33,566
Yes, we did it...
- Yes!

1180
01:55:35,228 --> 01:55:36,298
Yes!

1181
01:55:36,562 --> 01:55:38,064
Yeah!

1182
01:55:49,842 --> 01:55:51,913
Take it to the surface.
Fast...fast...fast...

1183
01:55:58,151 --> 01:55:59,528
Can we open the hatch, sir?
- Depth.

1184
01:55:59,619 --> 01:56:01,826
130 meters, sir.
- No, not now. Wait...

1185
01:56:29,682 --> 01:56:31,753
Now...now boys, open it.

1186
01:56:47,333 --> 01:56:49,973
Sir...sir...sir...

1187
01:57:18,931 --> 01:57:19,932
We hit them.

1188
01:57:27,840 --> 01:57:29,513
If our captain had still been alive...

1189
01:57:30,743 --> 01:57:34,088
...he would've been proud
of this 'classroom-theory' officer.
