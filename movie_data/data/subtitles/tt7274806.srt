1
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:31,540
Sir, I wonder why he does that?

2
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:34,540
He's always rubbing that
spoon against the wall.

3
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:35,790
It's good.

4
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:37,370
Keeps himself engaged.

5
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,910
Doesn't create any nonsense.

6
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:59,290
"OM, we worship the Three-Eyed one"

7
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:02,620
"whose scent nourishes and
strengthens the spiritual core"

8
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,870
"From the bondage,
freed from the captivity"

9
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:09,290
"Liberated from the
cycles of life and death'

10
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:10,290
All Hail.

11
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:12,040
All Hail.

12
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:14,000
All Hail Mahadev.

13
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:19,040
You reside on the banks of Ganga.

14
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:24,330
With his eyes on every danger.

15
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:28,040
You reside on the banks of Ganga.

16
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,910
With his eyes on every danger.

17
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,040
O lord with unkempt hair.

18
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,200
One wielding his trident.

19
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:37,950
One who is with you at every step.

20
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:41,660
Glory be to Lord Mahadev.

21
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,290
Prays Kaashi.

22
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:47,120
Glory be to Goddess Ganga.

23
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,120
Prays Kaashi.

24
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:52,580
Glory be to Lord Mahadev.

25
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:54,580
Prays Kaashi.

26
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:57,910
Glory be to Goddess Ganga.

27
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,000
Prays Kaashi

28
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:03,160
Our Lord is benevolent.

29
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,750
He doesn't let anything wrong happen.

30
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:08,700
But if he is provoked.

31
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,370
He can slash open the oceans.

32
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,950
Sing Shankar's praises on
the top of your voice

33
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:19,450
So he doesn't open his third eye.

34
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:22,580
Glory be to lord Mahadev.

35
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,870
Prays Kaashi.

36
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:28,040
Glory be to Goddess Ganga.

37
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,250
Prays Kaashi.

38
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:32,870
This is Kaashi's holi.

39
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,660
This is Kaashi's holi.

40
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:38,450
This is Kaashi's holi.

41
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,580
This is Kaashi's holi.

42
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:44,120
Praise Shankar, glory be to him.

43
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,870
The one who created this world.

44
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:49,870
Spirits and ghosts dance around

45
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:52,330
When Holi is celebrated in Kaashi.

46
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,290
I will rub red colour on your rosy cheeks.

47
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:58,000
And drench you with colours
from head to toe.

48
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,750
I'll get high and get
everyone else high too.

49
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:03,040
I'm going to smear colours
which won't come off.

50
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,620
This is Kaashi's holi.

51
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:08,450
This is Kaashi's holi.

52
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:10,290
[gunshot]

53
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,500
He laced my drinks with intoxicants.

54
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:22,750
And got me high too.

55
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:27,080
I am feeling ecstatic.

56
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:30,160
What is this state I'm in.

57
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,200
The festival of colours is here

58
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:37,620
Time to get drenched in
colours of love by your beloved.

59
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:40,200
The festival of colours is here

60
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,910
Time to get drenched in
colours of love by beloved.

61
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:44,160
Holi is here.

62
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,000
Holi is here.

63
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:50,040
Don't mind, it's holi.

64
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:53,080
The festival of colours is here.

65
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,080
and your beloved's drenching
you in colours.

66
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,660
Your beloved, yes your beloved.

67
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:02,660
With colours red, yellow and blue,

68
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,500
your beloved's smearing colour on you.

69
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,330
Your beloved, yes your beloved.

70
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:10,250
Kaashi!

71
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:10,830
Kaashi!

72
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:15,250
This is too much, Kaashi.

73
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:17,790
I'll chop your hands some day.

74
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,950
You perverts don't have the
balls to chop off my hands.

75
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,580
You and your friends should wear bangles.

76
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,500
You won't stop provoking me.

77
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,330
Next time you will pay.

78
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,700
If you misbehave with anyone
again I swear to Mahadev,

79
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:35,580
I'll turn you to ashes.

80
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:39,000
-Come madam.
-Come madam.

81
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,500
I'll turn you to ashes.

82
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:47,870
[grunts]

83
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,750
-You want to say something?
-No, nothing.

84
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:54,830
Thank you.

85
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,290
Why are so impolite?

86
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:01,500
If the girl is thanking you,
then you should say 'weklum'

87
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:05,620
-Not 'weklum' that is welcome.
-He should say something.

88
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,450
-Tell me something?
-Yes.

89
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,700
Is your friend always so uptight?

90
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,000
Ma'am this is Benares.

91
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:14,040
Even the crows here are colourful.

92
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,790
Long live Balwant Pandey.

93
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,200
Long live Balwant Pandey.

94
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:22,040
Long live Balwant Pandey.

95
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:25,040
Long live Balwant Pandey.

96
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:27,950
Long live Balwant Pandey.

97
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:30,450
Who is he?

98
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,000
Long live Balwant Pandey.

99
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:33,790
He is a multimillionaire.

100
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:35,790
He is trying his hands in politics.

101
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,250
His name is Balwant Pandey.

102
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:38,750
You have no idea Madam.

103
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,870
During demonetisation he
dumped loads of Cash into Ganga.

104
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,870
I believe he even smuggles
diamonds by hiding them in fish.

105
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:47,330
What are you whispering to her?

106
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,500
Don't believe everything he says.

107
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:53,120
He has lost his mind watching movies.

108
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,160
Kaashi, I'm from 'Nayi Khabar' newspaper.

109
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:02,790
-I want to publish your interview.
-My Interview? Why?

110
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:07,540
I feel that you are the person who
can help me explore the soul of Banares.

111
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,250
I don't have time for an interview madam.

112
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:13,290
I mean I've got a lot of chores at home
and I'm already running late.

113
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,160
Maybe some other time.

114
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:15,200
Okay.

115
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:18,620
Dear Rampyari, why don't you
start without having me break my back?

116
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:20,660
What chores do you have at home.

117
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:21,830
-Go with her.
-Hop on.

118
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,080
-Go with her.
-I said Hop on Rangeela.

119
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,580
-See you madam.
-Okay.

120
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:29,950
Why don't you talk to her?
She wants to take your interview.

121
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:31,040
See you soon.

122
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:09,000
Hi Kaashi!

123
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:11,040
Oh!

124
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:12,750
You and here?

125
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:15,290
Hold this kid.

126
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:18,000
Come

127
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:25,290
-Hey kid.
-Do it properly.

128
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:26,660
Don't laze away.

129
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,000
Your work is very difficult, isn't it?

130
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,000
Burning a human being.

131
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:33,450
Not a human being, a dead body.

132
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:37,160
Once the soul dissipates there is
no meaning to the body.

133
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,160
Kaashi I want to mention
you in my article.

134
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,250
About me or a 'Dom'?

135
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:45,330
About you.

136
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,790
There are many 'Doms' here.

137
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:50,870
But there is only one Kaashi!

138
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:56,950
Tell me about your family?

139
00:09:59,040 --> 00:09:59,370
Come in.

140
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:00,410
Come in.

141
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:04,620
This is my father.

142
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:08,410
What took you so long today?

143
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,660
Today there was a lot of work.

144
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,700
Okay.

145
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:12,790
Welcome back.

146
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,040
And this is my mother.

147
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,370
Where is the monkey of the house?

148
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:16,910
She's inside.

149
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:17,750
Ganga.

150
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:19,040
Hey Ganga.

151
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:20,620
Yes brother.

152
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:21,790
There she is.

153
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:24,660
This is my dear sister Ganga.

154
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,290
-And she is Devina madam.
-I see.

155
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:29,040
She is a renowned journalist from Lucknow.

156
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:31,790
She is going to write about
Benares in the newspaper.

157
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,500
Will you have some tea madam?

158
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:36,000
-I'll make tea.
-Forget about it.

159
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,120
Anyone who tastes your tea
will not wake up.

160
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:42,620
Never mind, Kaashi.

161
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,120
I'll have tea some other time.

162
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:45,790
Okay madam.

163
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:49,580
You have a very nice family Kaashi.

164
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,290
No madam this is a zoo house

165
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,750
And Ganga is the monkey of this zoo.

166
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:54,950
Brother!

167
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:58,910
Kaashi, can I click a
picture of all of you?

168
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,660
Yes, why not.

169
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:04,160
Hold on a minute let me at least
wear my new shirt.

170
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:06,700
Get me that new shirt.

171
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:08,330
Let it be father,

172
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:09,200
why do you want new clothes?

173
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:12,330
Even I should make my hair.

174
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:15,700
Doing your hair won't
turn you into Sri Devi.

175
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:16,370
Come on.

176
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,160
You'll look exactly how
God has meant you to look.

177
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,000
Everyone quickly.

178
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,870
Come Ganga let's click a picture.

179
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:23,790
We aren't making a movie.

180
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:25,660
-Carry on madam.
-Kaashi smile.

181
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:30,620
Okay Kaashi I'll leave now.

182
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:32,790
Okay madam.

183
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,000
When will you take me around Banares?

184
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:35,950
Whenever you say.

185
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:39,370
Tomorrow morning at ten on the Ghat.

186
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:41,000
Okay?

187
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:42,040
Bye.

188
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:52,540
Hey hero,

189
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:56,080
Don't look around.

190
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:57,790
I am talking to you.

191
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,620
-Yes brother you look really good today.
-Really?

192
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:02,790
Yes.

193
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:06,250
You are only taking madam on a tour.

194
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:08,250
Why do you need to put on all this makeup?

195
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,290
You are always negative.

196
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,290
Want me to put oil and look like a joker.

197
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:16,080
There is no need to get angry.

198
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,120
Go on now madam must
be waiting for you son.

199
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,200
Go.

200
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:28,700
Sohail Khan is disappointed
with the response for Tube light.

201
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:31,660
What are you reading in the newspaper?

202
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,700
-Today's breaking news is coming to us.
-Who the hell...

203
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,000
Kaashi!

204
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:39,910
Hey handsome.

205
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:41,540
What's up brother?

206
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:44,000
You look really handsome today.

207
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:46,830
All the cats in Banaras on one side

208
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:49,660
and you bloody cats on the other side.

209
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:52,450
Whenever I set out for something good,
you'll cross my path.

210
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,040
What's the matter?

211
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,370
Why have you transformed from
black and white movie star to a rock star.

212
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:57,870
Are you going somewhere?
I'll tag along too.

213
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:59,250
No I have to go alone.

214
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:02,750
My friend, turning down
your friend for a girl.

215
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:05,540
I'll slap you really hard.

216
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:06,910
-Get down quickly.
-I won't.

217
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,830
-Get down now.
-I swear on mother I won't.

218
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,080
I swore on my mother.

219
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:13,200
If anything happens to my mother,
how will you face my father?

220
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:16,080
No need to be so dramatic you jinxers.

221
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:16,750
Come on.

222
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,410
Do you guys want to hop on too?

223
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,120
-Yes, why not.
-Go mind your own business.

224
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:20,660
Get lost.

225
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:21,370
Good for nothing.

226
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,250
Let's have Paan first and then move ahead.

227
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:35,700
Get two Paans.

228
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:38,120
But I swore on my mother.
How do I get off the bike?

229
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:40,700
I'll punch you so hard all the
screws in your brains will get fixed.

230
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,290
Hop, skip and jump and get it quick.

231
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,830
Want it with tobacco or plain?

232
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:47,290
Today is a special day, make it tobacco.

233
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:49,120
-And give this to me.
-Take it.

234
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:51,830
Make a special paan today.

235
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:54,290
With all the fancy assortments.

236
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,370
What's special today Rangeela?

237
00:13:57,410 --> 00:13:58,450
I've won the lottery.

238
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:01,000
Stop asking questions like
the police and make paan.

239
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:02,450
Hey!

240
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:05,370
I was getting the paan and
he made me a fool.

241
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:07,410
You are bad luck.

242
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,080
Monkey!

243
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:21,910
Hello Madam.

244
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,040
Oh my god, Kaashi.

245
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:31,080
Looking too cool.

246
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:32,660
Thank you madam.

247
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,160
Please, don't call me madam.

248
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:37,790
I am your friend now.

249
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:39,450
You can call me Devina.

250
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:41,370
Okay madam.

251
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,450
Okay...Devina.

252
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:45,040
That's better.

253
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:47,250
So from where do we start?

254
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:51,120
In Banaras we start all our endeavours
from 'Ganga Ghaat'.

255
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:54,660
Oh shit!

256
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:58,830
My Saree is ruined and you are laughing.

257
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,040
What do I do now?

258
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:01,790
What's there to worry about it?

259
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:05,540
Ganga washes the sins of all
people this is just pigeon shit.

260
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,120
Ganga is in front, clean up.

261
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:12,830
Watch your step Madam.

262
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:47,830
Give me a little smile every day.

263
00:15:49,000 --> 00:16:00,750
And a new lease of life.

264
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:07,160
The bond that binds us
without any conditions.

265
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:14,370
That relationship you bring.

266
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:20,290
That relationship that you bring.

267
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:27,330
You must bring that relationship.

268
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:33,000
You must bring that relationship.

269
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:52,910
The day that I don't dream about you.

270
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,250
my sleep is upset.

271
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:06,040
You fill life in me

272
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:11,000
I feel alive again

273
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:17,370
The path that leads to you

274
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:30,160
You must bring that path to me.

275
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:36,330
You must bring that relationship.

276
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:42,580
You must bring that relationship.

277
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:49,200
You must bring that relationship.

278
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:24,620
I am like colourless still water.

279
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:29,910
But you create ripples of life in me,

280
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:37,000
Beneath your feet lay paradise.

281
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,950
If you are willing to bless me.

282
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:48,620
One that doesn't separate me from you.

283
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:52,580
Time floes quickly, doesn't it Kaashi?

284
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,910
Yesterday we were strangers

285
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:58,830
Today in the whole of Kaashi
this Kaashi is mine.

286
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,660
What happened?
Why are you quiet?

287
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:05,450
No, it's nothing.

288
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:12,540
Will you have dinner with me tonight?

289
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:16,910
Maybe some other time.

290
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,290
No today, come on.

291
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,910
Let it be, Mum and Dad
must be waiting for me at home.

292
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,870
I will never invite you to dinner again.

293
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:04,620
I knew you'll come.

294
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:08,790
Come.

295
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:19,120
When you wanted to stay,
why were you talking nonsense?

296
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:20,120
What's this?

297
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:23,910
I am learning your vernacular.

298
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:26,790
That's nice.

299
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:28,200
How about some wine?

300
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:30,620
Desi?

301
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,290
I don't have any of those.

302
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,330
I've never had this.

303
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:37,330
Will I get too high?

304
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:38,660
It'll be less.

305
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,160
The effect will be slow.

306
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:43,790
Try it.

307
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:46,040
Cheers.

308
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:53,580
Can I ask something?

309
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:54,580
Go on.

310
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:58,290
Girls don't look nice consuming alcohol.

311
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:00,700
What can I do?

312
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,410
This is my companion for loneliness.

313
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:06,580
What about your family?

314
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:09,200
No one.

315
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:13,160
My dad and brother passed
when I was a kid.

316
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:19,160
My mother, passed away a month back.

317
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:23,410
I'm all alone now.

318
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,450
You're not alone now.

319
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:27,700
I'm your friend.

320
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:36,580
To live one needs a life
partner not a friend.

321
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,200
Will you be my life partner?

322
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:45,830
I...

323
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:53,500
I was just joking, stupid.

324
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,700
I got shit scared.

325
00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:00,620
Tell me, did you never go to school?

326
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:04,910
No father didn't have enough
money to educate both children.

327
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:06,410
Only one could study,

328
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:08,830
So we decided Ganga.

329
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:11,370
I anyway wanted to carry
my forefather's work forward.

330
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,790
You love Ganga a lot, don't you?

331
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,910
Ganga is the reason I live.

332
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:23,330
Talking to you, the food will get burnt.

333
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:24,370
I'll be right back.

334
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,700
Ahh! Kaashi!

335
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:47,830
-What happened?
-My hands burnt.

336
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:52,410
I don't know why I put
my hands into the oven.

337
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,830
-One minute.
-But I

338
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:17,540
You must bring that relationship.

339
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:23,910
You must bring that relationship.

340
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:30,290
You must bring that relationship.

341
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:36,120
You must bring that relationship.

342
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:56,040
When my fingers touch you

343
00:23:56,040 --> 00:24:01,500
They are overjoyed.

344
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:14,290
They feel at peace when
they hold your hands.

345
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:20,120
What brings us closer.

346
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:27,000
You must bring that distance.

347
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:33,750
You must bring that relationship.

348
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:51,910
Kaashi.

349
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,620
Hey, I was just thinking about you.

350
00:24:56,950 --> 00:25:00,120
By the way, what brings you
to this part in the morning.

351
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:03,120
I was passing by so
I thought I'll drop in.

352
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:06,540
Do you see, how sweetly
he talks to the girl?

353
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:09,160
While talking to me he is always rude.

354
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,120
Bloody turncoat.

355
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:13,580
Who speaks like that in front of a guest?

356
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:14,290
What?

357
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:16,080
You have no manners.

358
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:17,910
Don't pay attention to him.

359
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,790
-He's lost it in his old age.
-Oh.

360
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,080
No worries.

361
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:25,000
Actually I came by to drop a
present for Ganga.

362
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:26,160
Ganga.

363
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:27,910
-Hey Ganga.
-Coming brother.

364
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:29,790
Don't run or you'll fall down
stumbling on the utensil.

365
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,290
-Devina you didn't need to do this.
-Come on.

366
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:34,290
Don't be jealous because
she has brought me a gift.

367
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:36,790
Wait a minute.

368
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:38,120
Hello.

369
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,200
This is so nice, I'm going to
wear this to college today.

370
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:45,200
Kaashi I have an important meeting.

371
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:46,000
I got to go.

372
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:47,370
Okay.

373
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:51,250
You'll wear.

374
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,500
-Yes.
-Behave nicely with me.

375
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:55,790
Otherwise I won't give you,
I'll burn it down.

376
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,250
You are a professional
at this brother Babina.

377
00:25:58,370 --> 00:25:59,450
What a long drag.

378
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:01,450
Makes my heart skip a beat.

379
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:03,120
Fantastic!

380
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:06,700
You need to have a big set of lungs.

381
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:08,580
-True.
-Take Pappu.

382
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:11,370
Hail the glorious lord.

383
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:12,660
Come to take a drag if you wish.

384
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:14,120
Stay in your place otherwise.

385
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,750
Glory to Mahadev.

386
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:18,790
I'll take a puff on this
side of the shore.

387
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:19,950
And release it on the other.

388
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,540
Take a long drag Lallu,

389
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:24,200
Doesn't matter how hard you try

390
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,120
You won't be able to set the
stage on fire like Babina.

391
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,910
-True.
-Look there!

392
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:32,830
-Burns bodies all day and earns 500.
-Yes.

393
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:35,160
I make more than that by
selling only ten packets.

394
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:38,040
If I am lucky then I make even more.

395
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:40,330
The fact is that his life is not worth it.

396
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:42,120
-Crazy guy.
-Look.

397
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:45,950
He's cleaning Rampyari
like it is his wife.

398
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,950
That's not the only female in his life,

399
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,750
there is someone else too.

400
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:53,910
Who?

401
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:56,330
That female journalist.

402
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:58,790
Day and night they are together.

403
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:02,540
No matter what you say Babina.

404
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:07,500
The scoundrel is an
expert at defeating you

405
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:12,330
The day I defeat him

406
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:14,450
He won't want to live or die.

407
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:19,080
He'll be like a fish out of water.

408
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,410
'Oh goddess Ganga'

409
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:33,580
Rangeela, Rangeela,
have you seen Kaashi anywhere?

410
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,450
-I see Kaashi everyday.
-Have you seen him today?

411
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:38,790
No, not right now. Must be by the Ghaat.

412
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:42,450
What happened? Anything urgent?

413
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:46,790
"You wash all our sins Goddess Ganga"

414
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:48,660
"Goddess Ganga"

415
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,540
"Goddess Ganga"

416
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:05,160
"We worship you, Bhagirathi!"

417
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,660
"Goddess Ganga"

418
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:15,500
"Goddess Ganga"

419
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:18,540
Wow Chuman uncle, your tea is fantastic.

420
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:26,410
Kaashi, I've been looking
for you everywhere.

421
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:27,040
What happened?

422
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,660
And why are you so scared?

423
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,910
I'm coming from your house.

424
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:39,950
-Ganga has not home from college.
-What?

425
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:41,950
She's never so late.

426
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:43,000
Let's go.

427
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:47,830
-What happened Kashi?
-Nothing uncle.

428
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,370
-Where are you going?
-I'll be back.

429
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:55,950
Her mobile is also switched off.

430
00:28:57,410 --> 00:28:59,290
She never had a mobile phone.

431
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:02,290
She had one but your
parents hid that from you.

432
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:12,450
Be careful.

433
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:15,330
Father,

434
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:18,620
Ganga's not back yet.

435
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,750
No son.

436
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:23,830
Can't understand where she must have gone.

437
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:27,040
-Mother, didn't she
say anything while going?

438
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:28,080
-No son.

439
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:30,330
She didn't tell me anything.

440
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:33,410
Why didn't you tell me
she had a mobile phone?

441
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,450
You guys lie to me too.

442
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:39,000
If something goes wrong with her than
you guys will be responsible.

443
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:42,040
Let's go to her college and find out.

444
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:43,040
Let's go.

445
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:44,450
Fantastic you guys.

446
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:45,500
I'll be back.

447
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:53,120
"Glory to be Lord Shiva"

448
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,540
"Glory be to Lord Bhole"

449
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:57,040
"Glory to be Lord Shiva"

450
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,750
"Glory be to Lord Bhole"

451
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:09,160
Stop! Where do you think you're going?

452
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:10,450
We're finding Ganga.

453
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:14,540
Brother this is Kashi, you'll
find Ganga everywhere.

454
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:16,370
Not the river Ganga, my sister.

455
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:19,200
-She studies here and
hasn't returned since morning.

456
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:20,040
-Brother.

457
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:24,290
the college closes at four, and it
is ten of the night now.

458
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:27,660
-She might have got locked in by mistake.
-Madam.

459
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,700
How will she get locked inside by mistake!

460
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,500
-Please leave.
-Mister.

461
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,200
-Please check once.
-Hmm.

462
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:34,620
Great.

463
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:38,450
You look like decent folks
so I'm keeping this.

464
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:41,040
Don't tell anyone else
or I'll lose my job.

465
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:43,330
-Come let's check.
-Let's go.

466
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:47,200
Come, come.

467
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:51,790
How is this light still on?

468
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:52,870
I switched it off.

469
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:54,000
Let us check.

470
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,790
All the girls do it.

471
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,500
If you want good grades you have to.

472
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:14,830
Ganga?

473
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,540
You, watchman?

474
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:19,580
Have you no shame professor?

475
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:20,750
I didn't do anything.

476
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,160
I don't know anything.

477
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:24,040
This girl is responsible for everything.

478
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:24,910
Ganga!

479
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,160
Get out.

480
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:44,250
What's the problem?

481
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:46,370
Sir, my sister went to college,

482
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:48,410
But she hasn't returned yet.
It's late now.

483
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:49,910
And we wonder where she is.

484
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:52,790
That's the problem with girls these days.

485
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:55,080
She must be out with one of
her friends having fun.

486
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:57,290
That is a rotten thing to say.

487
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,250
-Rotten?
-What's the matter, Shyam Sundar?

488
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:00,950
What happened?

489
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:02,830
Listen to his problem sir.

490
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:03,700
Stand aside.

491
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:05,370
I'll take over.

492
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:07,910
What will you do?

493
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:08,540
Sit.

494
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:10,370
Sit down!

495
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:15,410
What is your name?

496
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:17,450
Kaashi.

497
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:18,540
Full name?

498
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:19,660
Kaashi Chaudhary.

499
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,200
I'll hit you so hard here
you'll shit your pants at home.

500
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:24,660
You've got too much attitude.

501
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:26,000
Idiot.

502
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:28,830
Look inspector I'm a journalist.

503
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:31,040
And you can't talk to anyone like this.

504
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:34,580
It is your duty to help citizens.

505
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:38,160
Look, another smarty, meet her.

506
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:41,790
Madam if you are a journalist

507
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:45,790
What article are you publishing
with this Dom so late?

508
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:47,910
That's none of your business inspector.

509
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:49,790
Miss English.

510
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:57,040
Take this paper and pen,

511
00:32:57,370 --> 00:32:58,660
And jot down your complaint.

512
00:32:58,870 --> 00:32:59,660
Listen.

513
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:01,120
But in Hindi.

514
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:11,080
Yes, tell me?

515
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Madam my sister came to college yesterday,

516
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:15,620
but she didn't come back home.

517
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,120
Which department?

518
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,410
That I don't know clearly.

519
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:21,580
What is her name?

520
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:22,410
Ganga Chaudhary.

521
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:24,410
Okay. One minute.

522
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:29,250
Kindly check the records,

523
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:32,790
Which department does
Ganga Chaudhary belong to?

524
00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:35,200
Okay.

525
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:41,910
I wonder what's wrong
with girls these days.

526
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,330
They are really spoiled.

527
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:53,700
Are you sure?

528
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:56,200
Okay.

529
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:03,370
We just checked the
records right in front of you.

530
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:07,410
There is no student named
Ganga Chaudary in our college.

531
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:08,910
How is that possible madam?

532
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,200
-She studies in this college.
-Yes.

533
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,580
There is some confusion.

534
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:19,410
Let alone Ganga Chaudhary we don't have
anyone named Ganga enrolled in our college.

535
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:23,080
Madam, she used to leave
home everyday to come to college.

536
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:28,910
It is your duty to make sure whether
she would go to college or elsewhere.

537
00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:29,790
What are you saying?

538
00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:31,330
What nonsense is this.

539
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,950
There is definitely something
illegal going on here.

540
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:35,500
I will see you.

541
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:43,250
How is this possible?

542
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:44,910
Ganga studies in this very college.

543
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,290
On so many occasions I dropped her here.

544
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:49,450
There is something wrong.

545
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:51,580
I will get to the its root.

546
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,080
Tell me one thing,

547
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,370
Did she go anywhere else except college?

548
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:00,830
I don't understand.

549
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:02,830
Someone's playing games with us.

550
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:04,500
Who could be playing with us?

551
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:07,450
Do you have an old enemy?

552
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:30,830
Hey Pappu, throw that away quickly.

553
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:31,750
Yes throw it.

554
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:33,290
Where is my sister?

555
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:38,000
Why are you laughing?

556
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:39,120
What?

557
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:40,950
What did you say?
I didn't understand.

558
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:42,040
Your sister?

559
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:42,910
Hey.

560
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:45,200
Where is Ganga?

561
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,660
You were studying to be a crackpot,

562
00:35:48,370 --> 00:35:50,120
But now I think you've completed
your diploma in being a mental.

563
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:51,830
Keep your dialogues to yourself.

564
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:53,830
And tell me.

565
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:56,750
I know where she is but I won't say.

566
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:59,870
Do whatever you want.

567
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:08,540
Kaashi!

568
00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:12,950
"Glory to lord"

569
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:15,250
"Says Kaashi"

570
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:20,080
"Glory to lord"

571
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:22,120
"Says Kaashi"

572
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:25,750
No Kaashi!

573
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,250
"Glory...Glory to Lord"

574
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:32,330
"Glory...Glory to Lord"

575
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:35,660
"Glory...Glory to Lord"

576
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:36,330
Stop Kaashi!

577
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:37,200
Stop!

578
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:39,290
"Says Kaashi" - Kaashi.

579
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,500
-Run away.
-Please.

580
00:36:57,870 --> 00:36:58,870
Kaashi.

581
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:00,330
Stop.

582
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,370
"Lord Mahadev" - Run quickly.

583
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:03,160
Run.

584
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:05,370
"Lord Mahadev" - Run, run.

585
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:09,660
Run.

586
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:11,910
"Lord Mahadev"

587
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:16,160
"Lord Mahadev"

588
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:20,790
"Glory to the lord."

589
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:23,660
"Says Kaashi"

590
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:28,160
"Glory to the lord"

591
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:30,540
"Says Kaashi"

592
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:35,290
"Glory to the lord".

593
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,620
"Says Kaashi"

594
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:42,120
"Glory to the lord".

595
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:44,410
"Says Kaashi" - Kaashi.

596
00:37:45,290 --> 00:37:45,910
Kaashi.

597
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:47,500
Kaashi wait.

598
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:50,870
Please Kaashi he'll die.

599
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,080
I'll find out in my own way.

600
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:04,660
I swear on Mahadev, I will not spare him.

601
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:06,700
That's fine.

602
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:09,830
But yesterday if Madam had not intervened

603
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:12,370
That madman would've burnt you alive.

604
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,080
I can fight a man, not a madman,

605
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:18,000
You're right on point.

606
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:21,500
It's hard to predict when
he'll go bat shit crazy.

607
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:23,250
Who is that.

608
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:24,250
Where?

609
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:25,000
There.

610
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:29,830
Why is madam coming here?

611
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:33,290
-Don't know.
-Why, are you shitting your pants?

612
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:34,370
Not shitting my pants.

613
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:38,200
It is not scary when a girl walks away
but when she comes close that is scary.

614
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:39,290
Babina.

615
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,410
I want to talk to you about something.

616
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:45,830
What?

617
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:47,040
Me?

618
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:48,450
Yes, you.

619
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:49,750
What happened, madam?

620
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:51,580
Have you lost interest in Kaashi,

621
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:52,950
that you come looking for
Babina in his neighbourhood?

622
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:54,700
Shut up.

623
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:57,620
Can I talk to you for two minutes?

624
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,500
Yes, come on.

625
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:05,910
What is the matter?

626
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:08,700
Changed sides.

627
00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:24,120
You don't think of us as friends at all.

628
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:28,410
Thanks to madam we know what happened.

629
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:32,200
Look buddy I know these are tough times.

630
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:34,160
But what good will come
of losing your temper.

631
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,330
Destiny will play out how our lord wants.

632
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:39,660
And look at your face.

633
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:43,330
Kaashi, I want to talk to you alone.

634
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:45,750
Yes sure.

635
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:51,330
He is very stressed.

636
00:39:51,870 --> 00:39:55,660
I spoke to Babina,
He does not know about Ganga.

637
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:57,410
He is a godamn liar.

638
00:39:57,950 --> 00:39:59,830
This time he isn't lying.

639
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:01,870
I paid him to tell the truth.

640
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:04,410
Can't make out who is
lying or telling the truth.

641
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:06,500
Kaashi I went to Ganga's college.

642
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:09,450
Her friend Shruti might
be able to help us.

643
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,500
We will go and meet her tomorrow morning.

644
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,660
We've reached. Where is your room?

645
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:18,160
Six?

646
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:18,500
Here.

647
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:19,080
Okay.

648
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:25,700
Welcome.

649
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,500
I'd seen you two in college.

650
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,540
Since then I've been
trying to make contact.

651
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:35,200
You're Ganga's friend, right?

652
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:37,160
Hmm, yes.

653
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:42,290
-Ganga and I are in the same class.
-See, I told you Ganga studies in that college.

654
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,330
Where is Ganga?

655
00:40:45,290 --> 00:40:46,500
That I don't know,

656
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:51,540
But she has been very
upset for the past few days.

657
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:53,450
Why, upset?

658
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:57,160
There is a boy in our class,

659
00:40:58,500 --> 00:40:59,250
Abhimanyu.

660
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:33,580
Come to me.

661
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:38,080
And I'll get the moon for you.

662
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:46,290
And conquer the skies for you.

663
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:56,040
And wander like the clouds and
follow you everywhere.

664
00:41:56,330 --> 00:41:59,750
And I'll love you unconditionally.

665
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:08,450
And I'll love you unconditionally.

666
00:42:09,290 --> 00:42:17,950
And I'll love you more than ever.

667
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:21,870
I love you.

668
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:39,870
When you smile why do I feel happy.

669
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:48,330
When you cry I feel like
I'm going to cry too.

670
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:55,040
Like the bright rays of the sun.

671
00:42:55,330 --> 00:42:59,330
Come in my life like the dawn.

672
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:10,250
And I'll love you unconditionally.

673
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:13,040
You know he's a big flirt.

674
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:16,830
Don't fall for him. He doesn't love you.

675
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:21,290
Shruti, stop with your dark fairy tales.

676
00:43:21,410 --> 00:43:23,580
This is why your scores
in Literature are poor.

677
00:43:24,370 --> 00:43:27,700
I know Abhimnayu loves me a lot.

678
00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:31,370
And I'll love you unconditionally.

679
00:43:32,330 --> 00:43:40,040
And I'll love you unconditionally.

680
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:45,200
And I'll love you unconditionally.

681
00:43:45,370 --> 00:43:49,620
More than ever.

682
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:58,790
And I'll love you unconditionally.

683
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:01,540
Who is that girl?

684
00:44:02,370 --> 00:44:03,580
Ga...Ganga.

685
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:07,000
You want to humiliate me in society?

686
00:44:07,450 --> 00:44:07,750
Hmm?

687
00:44:08,950 --> 00:44:10,370
I'm contesting in the elections next year.

688
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:14,450
It is not right to be friends with a girl
who comes from the Dom family.

689
00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:18,790
The opposition will create a huge ruckus.
Don't you understand?

690
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:21,080
But Dad she is a really nice girl.

691
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:23,330
Every girl seems nice at this age.

692
00:44:24,450 --> 00:44:26,870
I am not stopping you from having fun.

693
00:44:26,910 --> 00:44:29,500
But at least have fun with
the people who are of our stature.

694
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:35,370
If you meet Ganga again you'll regret it.

695
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:38,000
and so will Ganga.

696
00:44:38,330 --> 00:44:39,830
-But papa please meet--
-Shut up

697
00:44:40,330 --> 00:44:44,410
Even after Balwant uncle's warning
Ganga and Abhimanyu kept meeting.

698
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:47,370
What are you doing?

699
00:44:47,410 --> 00:44:49,910
-My heart would have failed.
-Why do you worry?

700
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,870
Won't let you die so until I am alive.

701
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,080
Now hop on quickly let's go for a ride.

702
00:44:54,790 --> 00:44:56,450
No, I have a class now.

703
00:44:57,450 --> 00:44:59,910
Then let's go to Sharma sir
to get a printout of the notes.

704
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:03,540
Get lost.

705
00:45:05,950 --> 00:45:07,790
Hey! Who will attend class?

706
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:10,080
If I am late, you go.

707
00:45:13,370 --> 00:45:14,790
Sometimes in Daffodil restaurant,

708
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:16,620
Sometimes in some friend's house.

709
00:45:17,450 --> 00:45:20,160
And sometimes in uncle's farmhouse itself.

710
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:22,660
But...

711
00:45:24,910 --> 00:45:25,750
But one day...

712
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:27,540
What happened?

713
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:29,500
Tell Shruti.

714
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:41,790
Ganga, why aren't you drinking your tea?

715
00:45:42,290 --> 00:45:44,290
Why do you look so serious today?

716
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:48,200
Shruti, I've made a huge mistake.

717
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:49,160
Mistake!

718
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:51,160
What happened Ganga?

719
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:52,330
I...

720
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:57,200
-I'm pregnant.
-What?

721
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:02,700
Are you sure?

722
00:46:03,830 --> 00:46:05,700
Yes. I've checked again and again.

723
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:07,540
The result was always positive.

724
00:46:11,370 --> 00:46:12,750
Control yourself, Kaashi.

725
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:16,950
All this was happening and
I was lost in my own world.

726
00:46:18,370 --> 00:46:19,540
I will kill that boy.

727
00:46:21,290 --> 00:46:22,330
What happened next?

728
00:46:23,870 --> 00:46:24,870
I don't know.

729
00:46:25,330 --> 00:46:27,080
I haven't met Ganga after that.

730
00:46:28,370 --> 00:46:31,160
It's getting late Devina ji, I have to go.

731
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:32,330
Okay thanks.

732
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,040
If I need help I'll get in touch with you.

733
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:40,330
I swear to Mahadev.

734
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:44,620
If anything happens to Ganga...

735
00:46:45,450 --> 00:46:50,330
[Sanskrit chants]

736
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:56,410
-Kaashi!
-Hey Hey Hey.

737
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:59,580
What's the matter?
You want to break the gate.

738
00:46:59,790 --> 00:47:00,540
You work here?

739
00:47:01,410 --> 00:47:03,410
No, I am their son-in-law.

740
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:05,330
And I love wearing uniforms.

741
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:06,620
Is anyone at home?

742
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:09,750
Everyone's at home but they
are playing Hide and Seek.

743
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:10,950
That is why there is a lock here.

744
00:47:11,750 --> 00:47:13,290
I don't need your sarcasm.

745
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:13,790
Hmm?

746
00:47:14,410 --> 00:47:16,450
No one's at home, everyone has gone out.

747
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:17,200
Where?

748
00:47:17,790 --> 00:47:21,160
They're wealthy people they don't
tell this poor man where they go.

749
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:23,620
-When did they go?
-One week back.

750
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:44,660
[Gunshot]

751
00:47:47,450 --> 00:47:48,370
Hey!

752
00:47:48,870 --> 00:47:49,870
No Kaashi.

753
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:51,330
Kaashi wait.

754
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:53,580
He has a pistol Kaashi.

755
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:01,000
Kaashi.

756
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:04,120
Are you okay?

757
00:48:04,450 --> 00:48:05,330
Yes. And you?

758
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:06,450
Yes, I'm okay.

759
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:07,620
The scoundrels got away.

760
00:48:08,950 --> 00:48:09,580
Wonder who they were.

761
00:48:10,330 --> 00:48:11,660
They must be Balwant's men.

762
00:48:12,870 --> 00:48:14,080
Once I get my hands on them,

763
00:48:14,950 --> 00:48:15,950
I'll cut them to pieces.

764
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:36,660
Any news son?

765
00:48:41,290 --> 00:48:45,000
Where has our child disappeared?

766
00:48:45,950 --> 00:48:46,370
Don't cry mother.

767
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:52,580
Ganga may disappear from
prying eyes, but not from Kaashi's.

768
00:48:55,910 --> 00:48:56,580
I will find her.

769
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:31,500
I kept treading down all the way.

770
00:49:32,750 --> 00:49:41,790
I accepted every pain that came my way.

771
00:49:42,950 --> 00:49:51,620
I kept treading down all the way.

772
00:49:52,910 --> 00:50:01,500
I accepted all the pain I got.

773
00:50:02,950 --> 00:50:07,700
My path has faded.

774
00:50:07,830 --> 00:50:11,620
So has my destination.

775
00:50:12,330 --> 00:50:16,620
My heart's searching for you.

776
00:50:17,410 --> 00:50:21,870
My heart's searching for you.

777
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:26,830
My heart's searching for you.

My heart's searching for you.

781
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:46,700
My heart's searching for you.

782
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:52,750
My heart's searching for you.

783
00:50:54,580 --> 00:50:55,000
Thank you.

784
00:50:59,410 --> 00:51:02,580
I spoke to Shruti after
you went home last night.

785
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:07,160
She hid quite a few things
because you looked mad.

786
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:09,660
Like what?

787
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:14,200
Kaashi,

788
00:51:15,870 --> 00:51:20,870
Abhimanyu's dad, Balwant
would never approve of the relationship.

789
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,700
That is why they both
opted for a court marriage.

790
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:27,370
Marriage?

791
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:34,120
I'm going to Lucknow for some office work,

792
00:51:34,830 --> 00:51:36,000
I'll be back late.

793
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:38,500
You go to court and find out.

794
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:43,120
If that indeed happened
it could be easy to find Ganga.

795
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:47,540
Okay.

796
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:03,620
Sir, I need some information
on newly wed couples.

797
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,750
-You guys can go, come tomorrow.
-Thank you sir.

798
00:52:10,830 --> 00:52:11,580
Okay.

799
00:52:16,290 --> 00:52:19,370
Sir, I need some information
about married couples.

800
00:52:20,450 --> 00:52:22,000
You look old,

801
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:23,620
What is the age of the girl?

802
00:52:23,870 --> 00:52:25,580
Twenty years. My sister, Ganga.

803
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,750
I wanted to know
whether she got married.

804
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:31,540
Please go, go.

805
00:52:31,870 --> 00:52:33,580
-Go, Go.
-Please listen to me sir.

806
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:37,290
My sister has been missing
this is very important.

807
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:40,000
What am I supposed to do?
I haven't taken her.

808
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:43,250
I can't reveal confidential information.
You please go, get out.

809
00:52:43,830 --> 00:52:44,450
Listen sir,

810
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:46,290
My sister is missing,

811
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:49,620
I can give up my life for her,
I can also kill for her.

812
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:52,620
Will you give me an answer or
should I create a scene?

813
00:52:53,450 --> 00:52:55,160
I won't say. Get lost.

814
00:52:58,370 --> 00:52:59,330
What was the name again?

815
00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:01,370
Ganga Chaudhary.

816
00:53:15,370 --> 00:53:15,750
Here it is.

817
00:53:16,750 --> 00:53:17,620
Ganga Chaudhary,

818
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:20,750
They had come five days back to
give a marriage application.

819
00:53:21,370 --> 00:53:23,120
But, they aren't married.

820
00:53:27,790 --> 00:53:28,830
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

821
00:53:30,580 --> 00:53:31,540
Where are you going brother?

822
00:53:31,790 --> 00:53:33,160
You've come back again.

823
00:53:33,250 --> 00:53:35,250
-Where are you going?
-To meet your boss.

824
00:53:35,370 --> 00:53:38,250
Brother please don't create a
ruckus otherwise I'll lose my job.

825
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:50,540
Who is he?

826
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:53,040
He is a madman boss,
says he wants to meet you.

827
00:53:53,370 --> 00:53:56,950
Sir, your son and my sister
study in the same college.

828
00:53:58,370 --> 00:53:59,790
Both love each other.

829
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:07,410
What is your name?

830
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:08,450
Kaashi.

831
00:54:09,330 --> 00:54:10,250
Look Kaashi.

832
00:54:11,410 --> 00:54:14,410
My son has my blood flowing through
his veins not the water from Ganga.

833
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:16,500
Only Mine.

834
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:18,000
He...

835
00:54:20,290 --> 00:54:22,870
He will never fall in love
with a Dome's sister.

836
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:24,660
Domes aren't human?

837
00:54:25,790 --> 00:54:27,620
Until someone like us don't
provide woods for pyre

838
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:30,080
Your type won't see either heaven or hell.

839
00:54:33,250 --> 00:54:36,500
-Your tongue is razor sharp.
-Look sir I don't want an argument.

840
00:54:37,660 --> 00:54:39,370
My sister is missing since
the past few days.

841
00:54:39,950 --> 00:54:42,450
She and Abhimanyu went to
the court to register their application.

842
00:54:43,250 --> 00:54:45,250
Abhimanyu will definitely know about her.

843
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:48,660
My son has gone to Mussoorie for vacation.

844
00:54:48,750 --> 00:54:49,750
He'll be back in a week.

845
00:54:49,790 --> 00:54:51,790
Once he comes back
I'll ask him about the whole matter.

846
00:54:52,250 --> 00:54:53,830
I'm dying every second sir,

847
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:55,910
I won't be able to wait a week.

848
00:54:56,580 --> 00:54:57,580
I want an answer now.

849
00:54:58,250 --> 00:55:00,250
Bloody dome.

850
00:55:01,450 --> 00:55:03,450
Now I understand your agenda.

851
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:08,160
Your sister must have gone with
her guy friends to have a good time.

852
00:55:08,250 --> 00:55:10,660
And you want to put that on my son's head.

853
00:55:10,830 --> 00:55:11,500
Hey Balwant!

854
00:55:13,250 --> 00:55:14,410
Don't act over smart.

855
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:17,120
-I'll dismantle your organs.
-Get out.

856
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:20,040
I'm going now.

857
00:55:20,870 --> 00:55:22,080
To prepare two funeral pyres.

858
00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:24,910
If Ganga is harmed in the slightest way

859
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:27,410
I'll perform your final
rites with my own hands.

860
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:29,660
-Get lost.
-Shut up.

861
00:56:01,410 --> 00:56:01,750
Hello.

862
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:02,700
Yes it's me.

863
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:05,120
Did you find anything Kaashi?

864
00:56:05,370 --> 00:56:06,790
She had given an application
to register for marriage.

865
00:56:07,620 --> 00:56:08,370
Along with Abhimanyu.

866
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:11,540
We have to find Abhimanyu
as soon as possible.

867
00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:12,580
I'd gone to his house.

868
00:56:13,330 --> 00:56:14,290
His dad is a big jerk.

869
00:56:14,870 --> 00:56:17,200
-Was being very vulgar.
-And Abhimanyu?

870
00:56:17,370 --> 00:56:19,200
He said he's gone on a
vacation to Mussoorie.

871
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:20,910
Kaashi, Ganga has to be with him.

872
00:56:21,370 --> 00:56:22,750
We have to go to Mussoorie.

873
00:56:23,450 --> 00:56:24,700
Yes, alright.

874
00:56:44,450 --> 00:56:48,750
Don't let me so loose
that I get totally spolied.

875
00:56:49,410 --> 00:56:51,410
You pan your eyes on me.

876
00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:53,700
And I fly away with somebody else.

877
00:56:54,250 --> 00:56:54,870
Get it?

878
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:56,040
Tell me!

879
00:56:58,830 --> 00:57:00,500
Intoxicating night.

880
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:02,290
Intoxicating voice.

881
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:06,580
Let me take a few puffs with you tonight.

882
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:11,830

Intoxicating voice.

00:57:13,870 --> 00:57:17,500
Let me take a few puffs with you tonight.

885
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:21,330
You keep hopping from one club to another.

and falls on down on the floor.

887
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:27,700
I am a kite and you are its string.

String!

889
00:57:32,830 --> 00:57:34,500

Blow away your problems with the smoke.

I know this is wrong
but still let me do it.

899
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:13,790
I'm already spoiled so it doesn't matter.

900
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:17,500
Your arms is the place
where I forget ny attitude.

901
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:21,330
You were spoiled and you spoilt me too.

902
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:23,450
You are the kite and I'm the string.

903
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:28,950

904
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,700

Blow away your problems with the smoke.

909
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:49,410
Drag a puff and enjoy the ecstasy.

910
00:58:49,870 --> 00:58:53,540
Blow away your problems with the smoke.

911
00:58:53,660 --> 00:58:56,950
Drag a puff and enjoy the ecstasy.

912
00:58:57,040 --> 00:59:00,910
Blow away your problems with the smoke.

913
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:25,160
-Hi.
-Hi.

914
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:26,500
How can I help you?

915
00:59:26,790 --> 00:59:30,250
Actually we are looking for our
friend, Abhimanyu, Abhimanyu Pandey.

916
00:59:30,790 --> 00:59:32,910
Can you tell me whether
he is staying in this hotel?

917
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:36,500
Sorry ma'am.
I can't leak customer's information.

918
00:59:37,580 --> 00:59:40,580
Look I am a journalist and
Abhimanyu is our friend.

919
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:43,370
-It's his birthday tomorrow,
we've come to surprise him.

920
00:59:43,370 --> 00:59:44,040
-Ohh.

921
00:59:44,370 --> 00:59:45,750
-Surprise!
-Yeah.

922
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:49,750
Since this is the reason,
Let me check the records.

923
00:59:54,790 --> 00:59:56,410
-Abhimanyu Pandey?
-Yes.

924
00:59:56,450 --> 01:00:00,700
Ma'am he is in room no. 605.

925
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:03,500
There is also a madam with him.

926
01:00:42,370 --> 01:00:42,700
Yes?

927
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:43,580
Where is Ganga?

928
01:00:44,290 --> 01:00:44,870
Ganga who?

929
01:00:46,870 --> 01:00:47,700
Who are you brother?

930
01:00:48,250 --> 01:00:49,160
What is this nonsense?

931
01:00:49,330 --> 01:00:50,290
Where is Ganga?

932
01:00:50,290 --> 01:00:52,410
I don't know of any Ganga.

933
01:00:54,950 --> 01:00:55,950
Tell me where is Ganga?

934
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:57,750
I don't know of any Ganga.

935
01:00:58,080 --> 01:00:59,160
What is all this?

936
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:05,540
You're cheating on my sister.

937
01:01:06,370 --> 01:01:07,330
What cheating?

938
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:19,620
Kaashi

939
01:01:20,910 --> 01:01:21,660
Wait Kaashi.

940
01:01:27,370 --> 01:01:28,160
Kaashi!

941
01:01:36,910 --> 01:01:37,540
Kaashi.

942
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:42,830
-Where is my sister?
-I don't know brother.

943
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:57,290
I don't fear the game of life and death.

944
01:01:57,830 --> 01:02:01,200
You decide, life or death?

945
01:02:01,790 --> 01:02:04,450
I really don't know anyone named Ganga.

946
01:02:04,540 --> 01:02:06,040
-One.
-Kaashi. No.

947
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:08,080
-Two.
-I don't know.

948
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:11,540
-Kaashi.
-Please let him go.

949
01:02:11,540 --> 01:02:15,540
-3.
-No!

950
01:02:22,250 --> 01:02:28,500
[Sanskrit chants]

951
01:02:31,620 --> 01:02:35,580
Kaashi, Mussoorie police is after us.

952
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:36,620
I know.

953
01:02:37,830 --> 01:02:38,830
I don't fear anybody.

954
01:02:40,290 --> 01:02:41,290
I did the right thing.

955
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Let me go to Banares and
tell my parents everything,

956
01:02:45,830 --> 01:02:48,660
After that I accept whatever fate
Mahadev has in store for me.

957
01:02:56,250 --> 01:02:56,750
Hello?

958
01:02:58,160 --> 01:02:58,580
Yes.

959
01:03:00,410 --> 01:03:01,660
Tell me Inspector.

960
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:07,540
Okay, alright.

961
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:10,120
Who was it?

962
01:03:10,790 --> 01:03:15,830
I think Varanasi police has
found some information about Ganga.

963
01:03:16,620 --> 01:03:17,540
They've asked to meet.

964
01:03:19,540 --> 01:03:22,000
All hail Godesses Bhagirathi.

965
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:29,040
All hail Godesses Ganga.

966
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:51,200
-Can't recognize her face at all.
-Kaashi.

967
01:03:52,290 --> 01:03:55,330
This is the same dress I gifted Ganga.

968
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:05,330
-You'll wear this?
-Yes.

969
01:04:05,450 --> 01:04:08,040
Treat me nicely otherwise I won't give.

970
01:04:08,250 --> 01:04:08,910
I'll burn it out there.

971
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:18,700
Life sometimes come to an abrupt end.

972
01:04:19,370 --> 01:04:28,540
But the memories never do cease to exist.

973
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:38,910
Why did you leave us at this point in life?

974
01:04:39,330 --> 01:04:48,950
Look what has happened to
me because of you.

975
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:53,120
Life is but a burden.

976
01:04:53,870 --> 01:04:58,160
My heart's seaching for you.

977
01:04:58,620 --> 01:05:03,290
My heart's seaching for you.

978
01:05:03,870 --> 01:05:08,040
My heart's seaching for you.

979
01:05:08,870 --> 01:05:13,370
My heart's seaching for you.

980
01:05:34,330 --> 01:05:38,790
We were like the two shores of the river.

981
01:05:39,290 --> 01:05:43,700
Always together but always apart.

982
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:53,620
There prevailed a huge
distance between us.

983
01:05:54,290 --> 01:06:03,950
I am completly broken a
prisoner to my own confinemetns.

984
01:06:04,290 --> 01:06:14,120
My whole life feels buried
in the ruins of a crematoium.

985
01:06:14,290 --> 01:06:17,500
Nothing to be achieved.

986
01:06:18,790 --> 01:06:23,080
My heart's searching for you.

987
01:06:23,660 --> 01:06:28,080
My heart's searching for you.

988
01:06:28,660 --> 01:06:33,370
My heart's searching for you.

989
01:06:33,790 --> 01:06:38,910
My heart's searching for you.

990
01:06:39,290 --> 01:06:45,500
Why did you kill Abhimanyu Pandey?

991
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:47,500
Why did you kill Abhimnayu?

992
01:06:48,370 --> 01:06:50,370
He pretended to love my sister,

993
01:06:51,830 --> 01:06:52,540
then cheated on her,

994
01:06:53,910 --> 01:06:55,200
and probably killed her.

995
01:06:56,500 --> 01:06:57,500
Do you have any proof?

996
01:07:00,660 --> 01:07:02,660
Are you a weather forecaster?

997
01:07:03,830 --> 01:07:04,120
Hmm?

998
01:07:04,700 --> 01:07:06,580
You'll do anything
based on your prediction.

999
01:07:06,620 --> 01:07:08,330
I can do anything for my sister.

1000
01:07:08,580 --> 01:07:10,580
Shut your trap.

1001
01:07:11,750 --> 01:07:13,950
What you sow shall you reap.

1002
01:07:14,450 --> 01:07:19,620
The sister for whom you killed
that innocent man is also dead.

1003
01:07:20,450 --> 01:07:21,370
Case closed.

1004
01:07:21,870 --> 01:07:24,660
Even God knows how to give tit for tat.

1005
01:07:25,370 --> 01:07:28,410
Now you'll suffer in jail for the
rest of your life you scoundrel.

1006
01:07:30,290 --> 01:07:33,120
Deewan ji take his statement.

1007
01:07:33,910 --> 01:07:39,200
If he disobeys then beat him Red.

1008
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:41,540
Give.

1009
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:53,330
We did so much for her...

1010
01:07:54,910 --> 01:07:55,830
but she left us.

1011
01:07:57,700 --> 01:07:59,370
Now rounds of police and the court.

1012
01:08:00,620 --> 01:08:01,160
There will be no rounds.

1013
01:08:03,370 --> 01:08:04,080
I want to stay here.

1014
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:07,870
Ganga is dead.

1015
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:11,450
My parents have lived their life.

1016
01:08:15,290 --> 01:08:16,370
You get married to someone else.

1017
01:08:19,330 --> 01:08:21,200
My life has no meaning.

1018
01:08:21,750 --> 01:08:22,910
There is meaning Kaashi.

1019
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:27,830
-We've made a mistake.
-Mistake!

1020
01:08:28,950 --> 01:08:29,410
What mistake?

1021
01:08:29,910 --> 01:08:33,950
If Abhimanyu was in Mussorrorie
for the past few days,

1022
01:08:34,700 --> 01:08:36,790
How did Ganga's body show up in Banaras?

1023
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:42,500
What does this mean?

1024
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:46,040
This means only one thing
someone else murdered Ganga.

1025
01:08:46,790 --> 01:08:48,370
And the murderer is in the city.

1026
01:08:49,370 --> 01:08:50,040
But who?

1027
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:55,040
I've told my co-worker of the Banaras
Crime Bureau to find out everything

1028
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:57,040
whoever it is I'm not going to spare them

1029
01:08:57,660 --> 01:08:58,500
You just find out.

1030
01:08:59,950 --> 01:09:01,000
Bare in mind Kaashi,

1031
01:09:01,620 --> 01:09:05,910
If you are locked up we won't
be able to get justice for Ganga.

1032
01:09:06,910 --> 01:09:09,370
So under no circumstances
agree to what you've done.

1033
01:09:09,540 --> 01:09:11,080
I've already said yes.

1034
01:09:11,830 --> 01:09:15,750
Say no. Police FIR is
not admissible in court.

1035
01:09:18,410 --> 01:09:20,950
Madam, your time is up. Go now.

1036
01:09:32,870 --> 01:09:36,870
Balwant pandey ji I never back
down from my commitment.

1037
01:09:37,700 --> 01:09:42,750
You stay committed, keep
sending the money from time to time.

1038
01:09:42,950 --> 01:09:46,540
-and see my gameplay.
-I want to see Kashi hanged.

1039
01:09:46,910 --> 01:09:48,040
You'll get whatever your heart craves.

1040
01:09:48,700 --> 01:09:50,370
He will be hanged.

1041
01:09:50,660 --> 01:09:54,410
First let the case get
shifted to Banaras court.

1042
01:10:14,750 --> 01:10:15,200
Sit down.

1043
01:10:23,370 --> 01:10:25,080
Start the court proceedings.

1044
01:10:25,830 --> 01:10:26,370
Proceed.

1045
01:10:27,580 --> 01:10:29,040
-Your honour.
-What?

1046
01:10:29,660 --> 01:10:31,500
This criminal in front of us.

1047
01:10:32,620 --> 01:10:35,580
Is a dangerous and moraless killer.

1048
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:36,700
Bhatyara?

1049
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:38,830
Yes Bhatyara, Bhatyara.

1050
01:10:41,540 --> 01:10:41,950
Mishraji,

1051
01:10:43,370 --> 01:10:45,290
You are one of the renowned
lawyers in the city.

1052
01:10:45,830 --> 01:10:46,700
Thank you sir.

1053
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:49,160
Let thank you go listen to what I say.

1054
01:10:50,250 --> 01:10:52,950
At least don't eat paan in the courtroom.

1055
01:10:54,120 --> 01:10:55,250
Even I eat paan.

1056
01:10:56,290 --> 01:10:58,290
God forbid a day should come
when I eat Paan

1057
01:10:58,370 --> 01:11:01,290
And the judgement delivered
is not to your liking.

1058
01:11:01,870 --> 01:11:04,700
Forgive me your honour, forgive me.

1059
01:11:09,950 --> 01:11:11,790
Don't worry Pandey ji.

1060
01:11:12,790 --> 01:11:16,500
Forgive me your highness,
I am a creature of habit.

1061
01:11:16,790 --> 01:11:17,580
Mend your ways.

1062
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:18,830
Let's start.

1063
01:11:19,250 --> 01:11:20,000
Your honour,

1064
01:11:21,290 --> 01:11:25,250
This criminal, is a dangerous
and immoral killer.

1065
01:11:26,750 --> 01:11:29,290
For no reason, in the light of the day,

1066
01:11:30,250 --> 01:11:32,950
He killed my client's son.

1067
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:38,330
And in this murder this
madam here was his accomplice.

1068
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:41,370
-Miss Devina Khanna.
-Your highness.

1069
01:11:41,870 --> 01:11:44,540
This allegation is false and baseless.

1070
01:11:45,330 --> 01:11:47,540
First of all this is not a case of murder.

1071
01:11:47,950 --> 01:11:50,370
Abhimanyu death was an accident.

1072
01:11:51,410 --> 01:11:54,080
Kaashi had only gone
there to inquire about Ganga.

1073
01:11:54,870 --> 01:11:56,450
But a guilty's conscience
needs no accuser.

1074
01:11:57,160 --> 01:12:01,750
Abhimanyu was guilt ridden
so he jumped off the terrace.

1075
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:08,830
My lord the truth will be
before everyone's eyes now.

1076
01:12:10,250 --> 01:12:10,910
Your honour,

1077
01:12:11,950 --> 01:12:17,160
With your permission, I'd like to
ask the accused a few questions.

1078
01:12:18,290 --> 01:12:19,080
Permission granted.

1079
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:25,250
Kaashiji, tell me one thing,

1080
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:30,580
Did your sister Ganga
run away with anyone?

1081
01:12:30,700 --> 01:12:31,200
Hey lawyer.

1082
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:33,580
Why are you getting mad?

1083
01:12:34,950 --> 01:12:38,450
What I mean is, did your sister Ganga,

1084
01:12:38,700 --> 01:12:40,870
Go out with anyone.

1085
01:12:42,870 --> 01:12:44,080
Yes that is why I went out to find her.

1086
01:12:45,950 --> 01:12:47,250
But you didn't find her.

1087
01:12:48,040 --> 01:12:51,410
-And you killed Abhimnayu.
-Objection sir.

1088
01:12:52,790 --> 01:12:55,870
He is accusing my client of his fantasies.

1089
01:12:56,450 --> 01:12:57,580
Objection overruled.

1090
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:01,410
-Sinha sahab let him finish his statement.
-Thank you sir.

1091
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:05,040
Kaashi tell me one more thing.

1092
01:13:05,410 --> 01:13:07,750
Did you go to Abhimanyu's house?

1093
01:13:09,160 --> 01:13:09,660
Yes.

1094
01:13:10,540 --> 01:13:13,290
Did you threaten his father?

1095
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:18,620
Don't look left and right.
Give me the right answer.

1096
01:13:19,830 --> 01:13:20,830
Your honour,

1097
01:13:20,830 --> 01:13:23,500
I would now like to call Abhimanyu's dad

1098
01:13:23,660 --> 01:13:27,250
Mr Balwant Pandey to the witness box.

1099
01:13:28,410 --> 01:13:29,080
Permission granted.

1100
01:13:37,370 --> 01:13:38,290
Balwant Pandeyji,

1101
01:13:38,950 --> 01:13:41,750
Did, Kaashi come to your house?

1102
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:44,580
Yes.

1103
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:46,000
What did he say?

1104
01:13:47,080 --> 01:13:48,330
He threatened saying,

1105
01:13:49,750 --> 01:13:53,290
If he doesn't find Ganga,
he would kill me and Abhimanyu..

1106
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:56,370
Note this down your honour.

1107
01:13:58,120 --> 01:14:00,370
If he doesn't find Ganga,

1108
01:14:01,250 --> 01:14:04,250
He would kill him and Abhimanyu.

1109
01:14:04,950 --> 01:14:12,330
And he didn't find Ganga so
he murdered Abhimanyu.

1110
01:14:12,700 --> 01:14:13,200
Sir...

1111
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:16,250
I would like to ask a few
questions to Mr Balwant.

1112
01:14:16,750 --> 01:14:17,410
Permission granted.

1113
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:18,580
Thank you.

1114
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:24,500
Do you know Balwant,

1115
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:27,910
He would've killed your son,

1116
01:14:28,660 --> 01:14:31,450
But your son died before that.

1117
01:14:33,700 --> 01:14:36,910
What your son did to Ganga,

1118
01:14:37,370 --> 01:14:41,040
For that he deserves
the capital punishment.

1119
01:14:41,540 --> 01:14:44,040
Stay in your limits Mr Lawyer.

1120
01:14:44,120 --> 01:14:45,450
Don't talk about my limits.

1121
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:53,790
If the truth doesn't come out
your entire lineage will be destroyed.

1122
01:14:53,950 --> 01:14:55,660
You vile man.

1123
01:14:56,540 --> 01:14:58,200
-I will kill you.
-Mr Balwant.

1124
01:14:58,250 --> 01:14:59,580
-I will kill you.
-Mr Balwant.

1125
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,500
Mr Balwant, Mr Sinha.

1126
01:15:01,540 --> 01:15:04,830
-I will kill you.
-This is contempt of court.

1127
01:15:08,410 --> 01:15:08,910
What did you say?

1128
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,950
Please repeat once again.

1129
01:15:16,750 --> 01:15:17,580
Sorry Your highness..

1130
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:21,450
For the language I used in front of court,

1131
01:15:22,660 --> 01:15:23,830
I am extremely sorry.

1132
01:15:25,450 --> 01:15:29,830
But I wanted to prove that a few of my
sharp words could create such an impact.

1133
01:15:31,450 --> 01:15:35,620
That even a renowned man like
Balwant Pandey would lose his cool.

1134
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:38,450
And he threatens to kill me.

1135
01:15:39,250 --> 01:15:40,120
Then Your highness.,

1136
01:15:40,620 --> 01:15:45,580
Then when his sister is kidnapped in
rage if illiterate Kaashi says that

1137
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:50,000
We shouldn't take him seriously.

1138
01:15:50,660 --> 01:15:51,870
-That's all.
-Your highness..

1139
01:15:52,200 --> 01:15:54,370
Can I present a few witness?

1140
01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:55,830
Permission granted.

1141
01:15:56,040 --> 01:15:57,500
Kaashi admitted himself your highness.

1142
01:15:58,950 --> 01:16:02,080
-He murdered Abhimanyu.
-Objection sir.

1143
01:16:03,200 --> 01:16:06,500
The baton of police is enough to change
the truth to lies and lies to truth.

1144
01:16:07,080 --> 01:16:10,000
But the ink of the law
works only by the truth.

1145
01:16:10,450 --> 01:16:14,000
The ink by which the pen of the law works

1146
01:16:14,620 --> 01:16:19,620
will make sure Kashi is hanged to death.

1147
01:16:20,540 --> 01:16:24,160
Your highness., permission to
bring forth a few more witnesses.

1148
01:16:24,950 --> 01:16:26,950
Sir he had come to our
hotel on 26th October.

1149
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:28,950
This madam accompanied him.

1150
01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:29,950
How long did they stay?

1151
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:31,950
Around one hour.

1152
01:16:32,410 --> 01:16:34,200
And during that time
Abhimanyu sir was murdered.

1153
01:16:34,290 --> 01:16:35,910
Point to be noted sir.

1154
01:16:36,200 --> 01:16:40,790
Sahab I saw with my own eyes
he was running after Abhimanyu sir.

1155
01:16:41,250 --> 01:16:42,410
And kept hitting him.

1156
01:16:42,950 --> 01:16:46,160
This madam here tried stopping him.

1157
01:16:46,830 --> 01:16:48,830
But he didn't stop at all.

1158
01:16:49,330 --> 01:16:53,330
He threw the sir from
room no. 605 off the roof.

1159
01:16:53,790 --> 01:16:57,910
Sir, in front of me first he
hit Abhimnayu in the room.

1160
01:16:58,790 --> 01:17:00,040
He kept yelling,

1161
01:17:00,330 --> 01:17:01,910
"Where is Ganga?" "Where is my sister?"

1162
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:04,660
But sir, Abhimanyu did
not really know Ganga.

1163
01:17:05,370 --> 01:17:08,910
Abhimanyu kept saying no but
he did not listen he took him to the roof.

1164
01:17:09,330 --> 01:17:10,750
And he threw him off the roof.

1165
01:17:11,830 --> 01:17:15,290
I and Devina tried hard to
stop him but he did not.

1166
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:17,370
Son Maninder, tell me one thing.

1167
01:17:18,330 --> 01:17:21,120
When Kaashi went to the roof,
where were you?

1168
01:17:21,370 --> 01:17:22,120
Reception desk.

1169
01:17:22,290 --> 01:17:22,790
Reception!

1170
01:17:23,750 --> 01:17:28,160
When Kaashi and Abhimanyu were fighting,
where were you?

1171
01:17:28,620 --> 01:17:29,540
On the reception sir.

1172
01:17:29,580 --> 01:17:30,370
Reception!

1173
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:32,870
And according to them,

1174
01:17:33,410 --> 01:17:37,700
When Kaashi threw Abhimanyu
off the terrace, where were you?

1175
01:17:38,040 --> 01:17:39,000
Reception desk sir.

1176
01:17:39,370 --> 01:17:40,830
Reception!

1177
01:17:41,330 --> 01:17:44,290
Do you think you are
Sanjay from Mahabharat?

1178
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:49,250
That your divine vision allows you to
see everything from the reception desk.

1179
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,200
You tell me,

1180
01:17:52,950 --> 01:17:57,450
Did you see Kaashi throw
Abhimanyu off the terrace?

1181
01:17:57,790 --> 01:18:00,410
-Sir this guy was in a fit of rage.
-Oh.

1182
01:18:00,450 --> 01:18:02,160
I was afraid of his madness.

1183
01:18:02,500 --> 01:18:05,370
I got scared and ran away
least he kills me.

1184
01:18:05,700 --> 01:18:06,660
And this madam?

1185
01:18:06,830 --> 01:18:11,040
This madam, was running after
him trying to stop him.

1186
01:18:12,370 --> 01:18:14,870
When did you first see Kaashi?

1187
01:18:15,450 --> 01:18:18,000
When he first entered our room.

1188
01:18:18,500 --> 01:18:18,830
Okay.

1189
01:18:19,910 --> 01:18:21,450
What were you doing at that time?

1190
01:18:21,750 --> 01:18:22,660
I was taking a shower.

1191
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:23,750
Okay.

1192
01:18:24,370 --> 01:18:26,500
And what was Abhimanyu doing?

1193
01:18:26,750 --> 01:18:28,700
-He was also showering.
-He was also showering?

1194
01:18:29,620 --> 01:18:32,660
Did you have two bathrooms
in your hotel room?

1195
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:34,330
No, the one.

1196
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:39,040
You two were taking shower in the
same bathroom at the same time?

1197
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:39,910
Okay.

1198
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:41,450
Save water initiative.

1199
01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:46,580
Your honour, what sort of
questions is my able friend asking?

1200
01:18:46,830 --> 01:18:49,950
Are we discussing a case on
Government policy and initiatives here?

1201
01:18:50,410 --> 01:18:51,540
Mishra ji, Mishra ji.

1202
01:18:51,700 --> 01:18:54,620
These questions are an insult to
the sanctity of the court.

1203
01:18:54,660 --> 01:18:58,330
-And an insult to the female fraternitiy.
-You are not a judge.

1204
01:18:58,450 --> 01:18:59,370
I'm here for that.

1205
01:18:59,620 --> 01:19:01,620
-Mr Sinha please continue.
-Thank you sir.

1206
01:19:02,500 --> 01:19:07,290
Then it is obvious that you did
not see Kaashi from the bathroom.

1207
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:08,870
Right?

1208
01:19:09,290 --> 01:19:13,750
When you came out of the bathroom
you must have seen Kaashi?

1209
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:14,500
Correct?

1210
01:19:14,620 --> 01:19:15,120
Yes.

1211
01:19:15,790 --> 01:19:20,620
Now tell me when you came out of the
bathroom what were you wearing?

1212
01:19:22,620 --> 01:19:23,620
-Towel.
-Towel!

1213
01:19:24,870 --> 01:19:27,950
Did you go to the terrace
wearing only a towel?

1214
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:29,620
No.

1215
01:19:30,750 --> 01:19:34,870
When, you went to the
terrace what had you worn?

1216
01:19:35,700 --> 01:19:36,120
Kurta.

1217
01:19:36,620 --> 01:19:37,370
Only Kurta.

1218
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:42,080
-Did you not wear anything inside?
-What sort of questions are these?

1219
01:19:42,370 --> 01:19:44,500
Mr Sinha was sort of question is this.

1220
01:19:44,910 --> 01:19:49,620
Sir, this question is related to this
case, please give me two minutes.

1221
01:19:49,700 --> 01:19:51,700
Go on, ask her what she had worn.

1222
01:19:52,450 --> 01:19:54,750
What had you worn on the inside?

1223
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,080
-Churidar, pyjama.
-Churidar, pyjama!

1224
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:03,040
You came out of the bathroom in a towel.

1225
01:20:03,620 --> 01:20:08,410
Removed the towel,
wore a kurta then wore a pyjama.

1226
01:20:08,790 --> 01:20:15,000
For so long Your highness Kaashi
waited for this women on the terrace.

1227
01:20:15,450 --> 01:20:19,080
That you come there and
watch him push Abhimanyu.

1228
01:20:19,540 --> 01:20:24,080
And then come to court as Nagendar
witness and testify against him.

1229
01:20:24,700 --> 01:20:27,000
So Kaashi can be adjudged a criminal.

1230
01:20:28,450 --> 01:20:28,950
Silence.

1231
01:20:29,450 --> 01:20:30,580
Silence in the court.

1232
01:20:31,700 --> 01:20:32,660
Order, order.

1233
01:20:33,080 --> 01:20:38,330
Sir, my friend is wasting
precious time of the court.

1234
01:20:39,160 --> 01:20:41,160
And this why I want to say,

1235
01:20:41,450 --> 01:20:45,870
The allegations laid on Kashi are
baseless and lies.

1236
01:20:46,700 --> 01:20:49,580
Mishra ji, you want to say something?

1237
01:20:52,290 --> 01:20:53,040
Now,

1238
01:20:54,290 --> 01:20:57,950
I want to show you the CCTV
footage of Hotel Highland.

1239
01:20:58,700 --> 01:20:59,660
Sure, let's watch.

1240
01:21:30,700 --> 01:21:31,540
Your honour,

1241
01:21:33,250 --> 01:21:36,910
This CCTV footage proves,

1242
01:21:38,200 --> 01:21:42,660
Abhimanyu was being chased and hit
by Kaashi all the way to the terrace.

1243
01:21:42,830 --> 01:21:46,120
-And killed by throwing him off the terrace.
-Sir.

1244
01:21:47,290 --> 01:21:51,410
It's true you can see Kaashi and Devina
in this footage.

1245
01:21:51,790 --> 01:21:53,250
This a case to prove murder.

1246
01:21:53,620 --> 01:21:58,410
Now the Hindu ceremony of Kaashi and Devina
showing their faces to each other.

1247
01:21:59,540 --> 01:22:00,500
Silence please.

1248
01:22:01,290 --> 01:22:03,290
And sir this footage doesn't show

1249
01:22:03,290 --> 01:22:09,200
Kaashi killing Abhimanyu by
throwing him off the terrace.

1250
01:22:09,700 --> 01:22:12,540
Please tell the court in simple
terms what you want to say.

1251
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:19,540
Sir at that moment Devina, Priya
and Kaashi were on the terrace.

1252
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:23,330
How can my lawyer friend say so surely

1253
01:22:23,910 --> 01:22:26,250
that Kaashi has killed Abhimanyu.

1254
01:22:26,870 --> 01:22:32,870
And 2nd thing Your highness.,
the CCTV footage does show Kaashi chasing Abhimanyu.

1255
01:22:33,910 --> 01:22:40,250
This footage fails to show Kaashi
throwing Abhimanyu off the terrace.

1256
01:22:40,620 --> 01:22:41,910
To murder him.

1257
01:22:42,290 --> 01:22:46,500
Only on the basis of doubt
everyone is adjudging Kaashi a criminal.

1258
01:22:48,540 --> 01:22:51,790
No one denies the fact that
Abhimanyu is murdered.

1259
01:22:52,120 --> 01:22:53,750
But everything else presented is a lie.

1260
01:22:59,870 --> 01:23:02,910
The next date of the court
will be after two days.

1261
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:08,080
Till then the court is adjourned.

1262
01:23:11,370 --> 01:23:15,500
You keep chewing paan Mishraji
Mr Sinha will win the case.

1263
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:21,660
Before taking the case you were acting like
a lion but today you turned into a cat.

1264
01:23:23,250 --> 01:23:24,620
How will we win this case?

1265
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:27,830
Patience Mr Balwant pandey.

1266
01:23:28,660 --> 01:23:30,750
The game has just begun.

1267
01:23:31,620 --> 01:23:32,830
Why are you stressing out?

1268
01:23:33,910 --> 01:23:37,540
There is something called good graft.

1269
01:23:37,950 --> 01:23:39,950
Eye for an eye.

1270
01:23:41,160 --> 01:23:43,500
I want to see Kashi hanged.

1271
01:23:43,750 --> 01:23:48,660
Balwant Pandeyji,
money has a lot of power.

1272
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:50,750
Spend as much money as you want,

1273
01:23:51,370 --> 01:23:52,950
Burn as much money as you want,

1274
01:23:53,370 --> 01:23:56,330
Buy the whole system,
show the power of money.

1275
01:24:41,370 --> 01:24:42,000
Start the court proceedings,

1276
01:24:42,910 --> 01:24:43,700
Your honour,

1277
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:50,410
For the past two days I have been
trying to know everything about Kaashi.

1278
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:54,000
And the facts that I've
assembled during my investigation,

1279
01:24:54,410 --> 01:24:56,830
is going to surprise the court.

1280
01:24:58,370 --> 01:24:59,120
Your highness.,

1281
01:24:59,370 --> 01:25:01,620
The people in Kaashi's locality,

1282
01:25:02,250 --> 01:25:03,500
his neighbours,

1283
01:25:03,870 --> 01:25:07,620
told us that the Ganga who he
was searching everywhere,

1284
01:25:08,450 --> 01:25:11,580
the Ganga for whom he killed Abhimanyu,

1285
01:25:12,620 --> 01:25:14,620
she isn't Ganga at all.

1286
01:25:15,870 --> 01:25:19,830
[indistinct voices]

1287
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:21,200
Order, order.

1288
01:25:21,870 --> 01:25:22,950
Silence in the court.

1289
01:25:24,040 --> 01:25:26,200
-What are you saying Mishraji?
-Your honour.

1290
01:25:27,910 --> 01:25:32,660
In reality, no girl lived with Kaashi.

1291
01:25:34,410 --> 01:25:38,870
-Kaashi had no sister named Ganga.
-Objection, my lord.

1292
01:25:39,450 --> 01:25:44,040
My clever lawyer friend is
trying to spin a new story.

1293
01:25:44,290 --> 01:25:46,330
Your highness, if you give me permission,

1294
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:52,200
to prove my point, I'd like
to present my witness.

1295
01:25:52,700 --> 01:25:53,200
Hmm.

1296
01:25:55,370 --> 01:25:56,790
Sir this man is crazy.

1297
01:25:57,830 --> 01:25:58,830
Keeps talking to himself.

1298
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,750
He started hitting me all of a sudden
accusing me of teasing his sister.

1299
01:26:02,620 --> 01:26:05,790
If he doesn't have a sister,
how can I tease her?

1300
01:26:06,330 --> 01:26:10,250
To summarise sir Kaashi has gone crazy.

1301
01:26:10,790 --> 01:26:14,120
He talks the whole day as if he
is talking to someone

1302
01:26:14,620 --> 01:26:16,540
but there is no one standing next to him.

1303
01:26:17,160 --> 01:26:19,660
Sir this man has gone crazy.

1304
01:26:20,580 --> 01:26:23,080
I think he has fallen in the ghost circle.

1305
01:26:23,370 --> 01:26:28,000
Because of him I'm wearing
Baba Guru Ghantal's locket.

1306
01:26:28,370 --> 01:26:32,040
Ganga Chaudhary was never
admitted to our college.

1307
01:26:33,500 --> 01:26:37,330
But Abhimanyu was a
talented student of our college.

1308
01:26:37,580 --> 01:26:39,580
Sir all these witnesses have been bought,

1309
01:26:39,620 --> 01:26:43,450
their stories have been fabricated.
I want to present my witnesses too.

1310
01:26:44,370 --> 01:26:45,450
Yes, permission granted.

1311
01:26:46,580 --> 01:26:48,750
Your highnessthis is nonsense.

1312
01:26:49,290 --> 01:26:51,290
Ganga has tied me rakhi every year.

1313
01:26:51,950 --> 01:26:53,750
Their stories have been
fabricated by this lawyer.

1314
01:26:54,660 --> 01:26:56,870
These guys will lie for
Mariijuana worth five bucks.

1315
01:26:57,200 --> 01:26:59,200
Your highnessGanga was a dear to all of us.

1316
01:26:59,950 --> 01:27:01,040
All of these guys are liars,

1317
01:27:01,620 --> 01:27:05,950
Especially that Munna and Babina.

1318
01:27:06,580 --> 01:27:09,410
Your highnessI used to
drop Ganga to college.

1319
01:27:09,950 --> 01:27:13,250
All of them, have sold their
soul to the devil for some money.

1320
01:27:13,620 --> 01:27:14,080
Shame.

1321
01:27:14,450 --> 01:27:17,160
Sir, Ganga was my classmate,

1322
01:27:18,410 --> 01:27:20,410
She was involved in an
affair with Abhimanyu,

1323
01:27:23,160 --> 01:27:24,910
And she had got pregnant,

1324
01:27:26,330 --> 01:27:28,330
this had caused her a lot stress,

1325
01:27:29,580 --> 01:27:32,160
The day she revealed this to me,

1326
01:27:33,580 --> 01:27:35,250
was the day I last saw her.

1327
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:38,330
Sir I've met Ganga,

1328
01:27:38,910 --> 01:27:42,540
So no one can claim Ganga
doesn't exist at all.

1329
01:27:43,540 --> 01:27:45,080
Food for thought here is,

1330
01:27:45,790 --> 01:27:47,410
If Ganga did not exist,

1331
01:27:47,870 --> 01:27:51,040
Who does the body that
police found belong to?

1332
01:27:51,370 --> 01:27:52,620
[indistinct chatter]

1333
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:54,040
Silence, silence.

1334
01:27:54,250 --> 01:27:56,330
It is now my humble request
to you sir that you don't allow

1335
01:27:57,160 --> 01:28:01,250
Abhimanyu's murder tale to be
led astray in another direction.

1336
01:28:01,330 --> 01:28:02,330
Your honour.

1337
01:28:03,250 --> 01:28:06,120
The court isn't being led astray

1338
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:12,250
-but is discovering the truth behind a psychotic criminal.
-But Msihraji,

1339
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,750
If Ganga does not exist
whose body is that?

1340
01:28:16,080 --> 01:28:18,250
-The madam is right.
-Your highness..

1341
01:28:18,540 --> 01:28:24,330
To uncover more information about this
I'd like to call Inspector Ghanshyam.

1342
01:28:24,620 --> 01:28:25,500
Hmm.

1343
01:28:26,370 --> 01:28:27,450
Inspector Ghanshyam?

1344
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:32,410
How did you come to know
this was Ganga's dead body?

1345
01:28:33,410 --> 01:28:35,660
Kaashi and Devina verified.

1346
01:28:35,790 --> 01:28:36,410
How?

1347
01:28:36,830 --> 01:28:39,370
Her face was badly burnt,

1348
01:28:40,080 --> 01:28:43,500
But these two recognized her
by the clothes she had worn.

1349
01:28:44,620 --> 01:28:46,620
Pay attention Your highness..

1350
01:28:47,040 --> 01:28:47,580
You can go.

1351
01:28:48,160 --> 01:28:48,500
Yes.

1352
01:28:48,540 --> 01:28:52,080
Your honour, I'd like to ask
Devinaji a few questions?

1353
01:28:52,790 --> 01:28:54,040
If you give me permission.

1354
01:28:54,790 --> 01:28:55,950
Hmm. Permission granted.

1355
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:56,500
Devina ji,

1356
01:28:57,790 --> 01:29:01,660
How did you, recognize Ganga's dead body?

1357
01:29:02,250 --> 01:29:05,040
Ganga had worn the dress I gifted her.

1358
01:29:05,580 --> 01:29:06,200
Oh!

1359
01:29:07,250 --> 01:29:10,160
The dress Ganga wore was gifted by you?

1360
01:29:11,370 --> 01:29:14,700
I have a gift Your highness.,
even I have a gift.

1361
01:29:17,290 --> 01:29:17,700
This!

1362
01:29:20,830 --> 01:29:23,830
Is this the same dress you gifted Ganga?

1363
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:25,370
Yes...

1364
01:29:26,580 --> 01:29:27,290
Your highness.,

1365
01:29:28,500 --> 01:29:33,330
On Vmart you can find these
dresses for 550 bucks.

1366
01:29:33,580 --> 01:29:37,200
Only in Banaras we have 200
pieces of this dress sold.

1367
01:29:37,790 --> 01:29:38,410
Hmm.

1368
01:29:39,250 --> 01:29:40,000
Devinaji,

1369
01:29:41,330 --> 01:29:43,700
How can you be so sure,

1370
01:29:43,910 --> 01:29:46,200
that the dress the dead body wore,

1371
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
was a gift from you?

1372
01:29:55,580 --> 01:29:59,250
Guess your highness this was
a wild guess by Devinaji.

1373
01:30:00,580 --> 01:30:02,910
Our law does not accept guesses,

1374
01:30:03,370 --> 01:30:05,250
The law recognizes facts.

1375
01:30:05,370 --> 01:30:08,120
But I'm sure that dead body
belonged to Ganga.

1376
01:30:09,160 --> 01:30:11,160
Clothes can be replicated a dime a dozen,

1377
01:30:11,870 --> 01:30:14,620
But every human has a different shape
and size which is unique.

1378
01:30:15,370 --> 01:30:16,250
[indistinct chatter]

1379
01:30:16,540 --> 01:30:18,540
Sir, I've met Ganga on numerous occasions.

1380
01:30:19,290 --> 01:30:21,450
I can never be wrong in identifying her.

1381
01:30:23,410 --> 01:30:24,160
Your highness.,

1382
01:30:24,580 --> 01:30:28,290
Now I'd like Ganga herself to
walk into the court,

1383
01:30:28,910 --> 01:30:32,000
And make everything crystal clear
and reveal the truth herself.

1384
01:30:32,580 --> 01:30:32,870
What?

1385
01:30:35,080 --> 01:30:37,080
Silence, silence in the court.

1386
01:30:37,370 --> 01:30:40,040
What, what is wrong with you Mishra ji?

1387
01:30:40,370 --> 01:30:42,080
I'm right on the money Your highness..

1388
01:30:42,910 --> 01:30:44,660
On the count of three,

1389
01:30:45,450 --> 01:30:49,500
Ganga will enter this courtroom
from that door.

1390
01:30:54,790 --> 01:30:55,330
One,

1391
01:30:59,700 --> 01:31:00,540
Two,

1392
01:31:08,750 --> 01:31:09,830
Three.

1393
01:31:21,700 --> 01:31:23,580
Your magic trick failed Mishra ji.

1394
01:31:23,950 --> 01:31:27,620
-Where is Ganga?
-This is exactly what I wanted.

1395
01:31:27,700 --> 01:31:28,080
What?

1396
01:31:28,450 --> 01:31:30,700
I wanted my trick to fail.

1397
01:31:31,910 --> 01:31:36,410
Didn't you notice that you,
Kaashi and Devina

1398
01:31:36,870 --> 01:31:40,620
and everyone in this court
were staring at that door

1399
01:31:40,620 --> 01:31:44,040
-That Ganga will appear.
-That is because you asked us to.

1400
01:31:44,290 --> 01:31:46,120
-I asked.
-Yes.

1401
01:31:46,120 --> 01:31:52,950
But Ganga didn't come because
not everyone here believes

1402
01:31:53,120 --> 01:31:55,370
that the dead body found
belonged to Ganga.

1403
01:31:56,620 --> 01:31:59,540
That is why all of us were
staring at that door.

1404
01:32:00,370 --> 01:32:02,200
that maybe Ganga will appear.

1405
01:32:03,450 --> 01:32:05,580
Even Kashi and Devina even
after they identified her body.

1406
01:32:06,500 --> 01:32:07,290
Your honour,

1407
01:32:08,040 --> 01:32:11,660
The fact is there is no Ganga

1408
01:32:12,120 --> 01:32:14,120
Because she does not exist,

1409
01:32:14,580 --> 01:32:16,580
where will her dead
body come into existence from?

1410
01:32:17,620 --> 01:32:18,290
Enough is enough.

1411
01:32:19,580 --> 01:32:22,160
Please free us from the
madness that is this case.

1412
01:32:23,200 --> 01:32:28,290
And please find Kaashi guilty
and sentence me to a punishment.

1413
01:32:28,410 --> 01:32:29,580
Don't teach what I have to do.

1414
01:32:33,080 --> 01:32:36,540
The hearings till now have been inconclusive
for the court to reach a conclusion.

1415
01:32:37,330 --> 01:32:41,160
In the next hearing the court asks
the parents of Kaashi to be present

1416
01:32:41,540 --> 01:32:43,540
So the court can reach a conclusion.

1417
01:32:44,370 --> 01:32:47,040
Till then, court is adjourned.

1418
01:32:50,450 --> 01:32:52,660
Kaashi they are playing mind games.

1419
01:32:52,870 --> 01:32:54,870
They want the strictest
punishment for you.

1420
01:32:55,500 --> 01:32:56,500
That doesn't matter,

1421
01:32:57,410 --> 01:32:59,660
You please find out the name of
Ganga's murderer.

1422
01:33:00,540 --> 01:33:04,410
After that these handcuffs, the lock-up
or the court together won't be able to stop me.

1423
01:33:05,040 --> 01:33:06,660
Everything will be over soon.

1424
01:33:07,620 --> 01:33:11,450
But you have to control
your emotions Kaashi.

1425
01:33:16,330 --> 01:33:16,830
Mr Sinha,

1426
01:33:17,370 --> 01:33:22,000
In the last hearing the court ordered
Kaashi's parents to be present.

1427
01:33:22,330 --> 01:33:24,410
-Are they present?
-Sir, they are on the way.

1428
01:33:26,410 --> 01:33:26,950
[inaudible]

1429
01:33:30,790 --> 01:33:32,200
Order, order. Silence, please.

1430
01:33:32,660 --> 01:33:35,160
What is happening in my court!
Will somebody explain?

1431
01:33:38,500 --> 01:33:41,000
Your highness., I'm coming
from Kaashi's house

1432
01:33:41,450 --> 01:33:45,200
Uncle and aunty are not at home,
I couldn't find them anywhere.

1433
01:33:45,910 --> 01:33:46,830
They're missing.

1434
01:33:47,290 --> 01:33:53,410
Sir, I fear this a pre-planned
move to kidnap Kaashi's parents.

1435
01:33:53,870 --> 01:33:58,330
And I'm pretty sure the brains behind
this operation is Balwant Pandey.

1436
01:33:58,410 --> 01:34:02,700
And for that I request the court to
arrest Mr Balwant Pandey.

1437
01:34:07,080 --> 01:34:10,290
-Mishraji.
-I am extremely sorry sir.

1438
01:34:11,040 --> 01:34:13,040
Kashi's parents are not at home,

1439
01:34:13,950 --> 01:34:16,040
they could've run away.

1440
01:34:16,790 --> 01:34:21,080
Your honour this statement
is a bit offensive.

1441
01:34:21,580 --> 01:34:21,950
Sir,

1442
01:34:22,700 --> 01:34:24,250
If my parents are hurt,

1443
01:34:24,950 --> 01:34:26,120
I swear to Mahadev,

1444
01:34:26,200 --> 01:34:29,620
I'll turn the entire city of Kaashi
into a crematorium.

1445
01:34:29,830 --> 01:34:31,540
Kaashi, Kaashi, Kaashi.

1446
01:34:31,540 --> 01:34:34,200
I'm present here to decide
what is wrong and right.

1447
01:34:34,750 --> 01:34:35,660
Your honour,

1448
01:34:36,200 --> 01:34:41,540
Now let me call on the most
important witness of this case.

1449
01:34:43,540 --> 01:34:44,330
Permission granted.

1450
01:34:47,580 --> 01:34:48,410
Chuman uncle?

1451
01:34:49,040 --> 01:34:49,450
Please come.

1452
01:34:52,370 --> 01:34:53,200
What is your name?

1453
01:34:54,160 --> 01:34:56,160
My name is Chuman.

1454
01:34:56,660 --> 01:35:00,700
Myself and Kaashi's dad were
the closest of friends.

1455
01:35:01,370 --> 01:35:02,410
Were close friends?

1456
01:35:03,870 --> 01:35:05,370
What does this mean?

1457
01:35:06,290 --> 01:35:09,950
It means Kaashi's dad
has long passed away.

1458
01:35:12,830 --> 01:35:14,450
Why are you lying uncle?

1459
01:35:14,580 --> 01:35:16,290
Kaashi, Kaashi, Calm down.

1460
01:35:17,370 --> 01:35:18,830
Silence, silence in the court.

1461
01:35:19,160 --> 01:35:19,700
Continue.

1462
01:35:19,910 --> 01:35:24,120
A plague was rampant in the city.

1463
01:35:25,120 --> 01:35:27,750
Which consumed Kaashi's entire family.

1464
01:35:29,330 --> 01:35:31,250
I'm sorry they are no more.

1465
01:35:40,620 --> 01:35:41,080
Ganga.

1466
01:35:42,790 --> 01:35:43,120
Ganga.

1467
01:35:43,950 --> 01:35:45,250
Hey Ganga, catch me.

1468
01:35:47,540 --> 01:35:48,200
Catch me if you can.

1469
01:35:48,290 --> 01:35:52,830
Even after his family passed
away he could see them.

1470
01:35:53,330 --> 01:35:56,870
We never told anything
about this to Kaashi.

1471
01:35:57,120 --> 01:35:58,330
He's lying Your highness..

1472
01:35:59,250 --> 01:36:00,330
You sold your soul too.

1473
01:36:00,580 --> 01:36:03,250
Sir, all the witnesses
have been manipulated.

1474
01:36:03,750 --> 01:36:05,580
The court will decide that, Mr Sinha.

1475
01:36:05,870 --> 01:36:06,660
You sit down.

1476
01:36:08,160 --> 01:36:09,290
In light of the recent testimonies,

1477
01:36:11,120 --> 01:36:12,500
The court orders,

1478
01:36:13,370 --> 01:36:15,120
Before the next hearing,

1479
01:36:15,790 --> 01:36:17,790
Kaashi's mental faculties
should be tested.

1480
01:36:21,950 --> 01:36:24,950
And for now, the court is adjourned.

1481
01:36:32,080 --> 01:36:34,200
-You've come to prove I'm crazy.
-No.

1482
01:36:35,660 --> 01:36:37,660
I've come to make sure
you are perfectly alright.

1483
01:36:38,870 --> 01:36:42,620
-I can't trust anyone sir.
-But you will have to trust me.

1484
01:36:43,330 --> 01:36:45,950
You know quite well you
have no other alternative.

1485
01:36:46,790 --> 01:36:47,700
I'm not crazy.

1486
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:49,330
I'm poor.

1487
01:36:50,910 --> 01:36:53,660
And that is why they are using wealth
to buy off everyone and prove I'm crazy.

1488
01:36:53,870 --> 01:36:54,330
I know.

1489
01:36:56,080 --> 01:36:58,080
That is why I've come to help you.

1490
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:01,700
Just answer a few of my questions.

1491
01:37:03,080 --> 01:37:05,950
-And truth will be revealed to everyone.
-Even you'll be bought by them.

1492
01:37:07,160 --> 01:37:08,080
I can't be bought Kaashi.

1493
01:37:10,370 --> 01:37:11,120
It's my job.

1494
01:37:11,450 --> 01:37:13,750
-Let's get started.
-Yes sir.

1495
01:37:18,370 --> 01:37:20,370
[inaudible]

1496
01:37:39,950 --> 01:37:41,540
Tell the court doctor,

1497
01:37:42,700 --> 01:37:43,870
What does your report say?

1498
01:37:44,450 --> 01:37:47,160
Your highness, I spoke to Kaashi
alone and in confidence.

1499
01:37:48,660 --> 01:37:51,410
What I found out was shocking,

1500
01:37:52,450 --> 01:37:56,120
With your permission,
I'd like to ask him a few questions.

1501
01:37:56,540 --> 01:37:58,370
-Permission granted.
-Thank you sir.

1502
01:38:00,620 --> 01:38:04,750
Kaashi, tell me who cooks
your food at home?

1503
01:38:06,500 --> 01:38:08,120
I make my own food.

1504
01:38:09,120 --> 01:38:09,330
Why?

1505
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:12,620
My stomach doesn't agree
with my Mother's food,

1506
01:38:13,250 --> 01:38:14,580
She makes spicy food,

1507
01:38:16,160 --> 01:38:17,120
What about your sister,

1508
01:38:18,120 --> 01:38:19,120
Even she can cook food?

1509
01:38:19,950 --> 01:38:22,250
She is busy with her college and tuitions.

1510
01:38:25,700 --> 01:38:26,620
Your dad's profession?

1511
01:38:27,410 --> 01:38:29,000
He taunts me all day, every day.

1512
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:31,200
Why?

1513
01:38:33,160 --> 01:38:36,040
Does your dad not work
at the crematorium now?

1514
01:38:37,200 --> 01:38:39,200
I can't let my dad work in his old age.

1515
01:38:40,160 --> 01:38:41,200
I'm poor not unfit.

1516
01:38:42,910 --> 01:38:43,910
Okay tell me one thing.

1517
01:38:46,250 --> 01:38:49,500
How is your relationship with your sister?

1518
01:38:50,410 --> 01:38:51,450
She was my life,

1519
01:38:53,370 --> 01:38:53,790
but...

1520
01:38:56,160 --> 01:38:57,080
I couldn't...

1521
01:38:59,410 --> 01:39:00,040
Get a grip.

1522
01:39:01,950 --> 01:39:02,620
Tell me one more thing,

1523
01:39:04,620 --> 01:39:07,200
Your sister would tie you rakhi.

1524
01:39:07,540 --> 01:39:08,450
First she would.

1525
01:39:10,080 --> 01:39:11,540
Then I stopped her myself.

1526
01:39:12,080 --> 01:39:12,410
Why?

1527
01:39:13,200 --> 01:39:15,200
We had a big fight on Rakshabandhan,

1528
01:39:16,290 --> 01:39:18,250
I swore on my mother,
I would never allow her to tie Rakhi

1529
01:39:20,290 --> 01:39:22,290
I could never break that promise.

1530
01:39:23,370 --> 01:39:23,910
Okay.

1531
01:39:26,200 --> 01:39:27,000
When you come home,

1532
01:39:28,250 --> 01:39:29,410
who opens the door for you?

1533
01:39:29,950 --> 01:39:30,870
It is open

1534
01:39:32,160 --> 01:39:33,870
who is poor enough to steal
from a Domes house, your highness?

1535
01:39:35,750 --> 01:39:36,910
When you reach home,

1536
01:39:37,870 --> 01:39:39,620
Who serves you a glass of Water?

1537
01:39:40,370 --> 01:39:43,120
Your sister Ganga or your mother.

1538
01:39:43,700 --> 01:39:45,700
We don't drink water from a female.

1539
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:48,200
Point to be noted, your honour.

1540
01:39:49,750 --> 01:39:51,410
All these people in Kaashi's life,

1541
01:39:52,700 --> 01:39:53,950
His parents,

1542
01:39:55,080 --> 01:39:56,080
Sister Ganga,

1543
01:39:57,250 --> 01:39:59,540
these people don't exist in reality.

1544
01:40:02,830 --> 01:40:04,160
Silence ladies and gentlemen.

1545
01:40:04,950 --> 01:40:06,080
Let him complete,

1546
01:40:07,580 --> 01:40:08,290
They don't exist?

1547
01:40:08,870 --> 01:40:10,870
All the questions I've asked Kaashi,

1548
01:40:11,620 --> 01:40:14,830
Led me to believe that the people he sees,

1549
01:40:15,660 --> 01:40:17,950
Don't play any active role in his life.

1550
01:40:18,910 --> 01:40:20,580
For e.g he prepares his own food,

1551
01:40:20,910 --> 01:40:21,830
He drinks water himself.

1552
01:40:23,120 --> 01:40:25,160
No one opens the door for him
when he reaches home,

1553
01:40:26,370 --> 01:40:30,580
However when you talk about
his passive tasks, all these characters are involved.

1554
01:40:31,790 --> 01:40:34,120
In fights, arguments.

1555
01:40:35,080 --> 01:40:37,790
Kaashi has created a world full
of fantasy around him.

1556
01:40:38,540 --> 01:40:39,540
Fantasy characters,

1557
01:40:41,290 --> 01:40:42,700
who he grew up with,

1558
01:40:43,830 --> 01:40:46,330
and in all probabilities,
will grow older too.

1559
01:40:47,790 --> 01:40:50,410
Your highness these are
Kaashi's hallucinations.

1560
01:40:50,700 --> 01:40:52,450
Balwant bribed even you.

1561
01:40:53,580 --> 01:40:54,580
I am not going to leave you.

1562
01:40:54,950 --> 01:40:56,830
-Kaashi.
-Objection my lord.

1563
01:40:57,450 --> 01:40:58,830
His testimony is wrong.

1564
01:40:59,410 --> 01:41:02,750
I think he is a mental patient
not a psychiatrist.

1565
01:41:03,250 --> 01:41:04,450
Objection overruled.

1566
01:41:04,910 --> 01:41:06,410
Sit down, you sit down.

1567
01:41:06,580 --> 01:41:08,160
Mr Balwant, you sit down too.

1568
01:41:08,330 --> 01:41:10,290
-You please continue.
-Your honour.

1569
01:41:11,790 --> 01:41:13,950
This is a serious case of Schizophrenia.

1570
01:41:14,040 --> 01:41:16,080
Called paranoid psychosis.

1571
01:41:17,040 --> 01:41:21,040
In extreme cases of this disease
the patient can get extremely violent,

1572
01:41:21,040 --> 01:41:23,540
if someone interferes in
the slightest way in their fantasy world.

1573
01:41:25,370 --> 01:41:27,620
He can do anything to anyone,

1574
01:41:28,450 --> 01:41:31,000
And this is probably why
he killled Abhimanyu.

1575
01:41:31,750 --> 01:41:32,750
Your honour,

1576
01:41:34,040 --> 01:41:36,160
How many more witnesses
does the court require?

1577
01:41:37,160 --> 01:41:40,160
We are done now please pass
the judgment, your honour.

1578
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:44,750
-He is a pyschopath and his sentence is death.
-Objection.

1579
01:41:45,290 --> 01:41:46,450
Objection, my lord.

1580
01:41:47,080 --> 01:41:51,250
It is still not proved that Kaashi
has killed Abhimanyu.

1581
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,160
-Objection overruled.
-How much did Balwant pay you?

1582
01:41:54,540 --> 01:41:57,580
I can't be bought, it's my job.

1583
01:41:58,450 --> 01:42:01,160
Kaashi, do you want to say
anything in your defence?

1584
01:42:01,370 --> 01:42:07,370
Yes I killed Abhimanyu and threw him
off the terrace because he cheated on my sister.

1585
01:42:08,370 --> 01:42:10,540
But I did commit one mistake.

1586
01:42:11,370 --> 01:42:16,910
Abhimanyu didn't kill my sister
it was Balwant who did.

1587
01:42:17,580 --> 01:42:20,790
Brother Kaashi, Ganga had come to
meet Balwant the other day.

1588
01:42:21,370 --> 01:42:24,410
He called her, I was standing outside.

1589
01:42:25,580 --> 01:42:28,540
I could hear violent screams from inside.

1590
01:42:29,620 --> 01:42:33,160
Then I saw Balwant sir
pushing her off the balcony.

1591
01:42:33,750 --> 01:42:35,040
Then he hid the body,

1592
01:42:36,250 --> 01:42:39,500
It also looked like he raped her.

1593
01:42:40,580 --> 01:42:42,370
Balwant is a disgusting man.

1594
01:42:43,870 --> 01:42:47,120
Brother Kaashi, don't tell this to anyone.

1595
01:42:47,450 --> 01:42:49,000
If Balwant finds out I told you,

1596
01:42:49,870 --> 01:42:51,830
He'll kill me as well.

1597
01:42:54,950 --> 01:42:59,410
You kill my son and then blame me?

1598
01:42:59,500 --> 01:43:01,120
Not blaming you but telling the truth.

1599
01:43:01,500 --> 01:43:05,250
Till I don't kill you I won't be
able to sleep in peace.

1600
01:43:05,410 --> 01:43:06,370
Order, order.

1601
01:43:06,750 --> 01:43:08,160
You'll kill me?

1602
01:43:08,750 --> 01:43:10,080
You crazy man.

1603
01:43:10,580 --> 01:43:11,580
You dare.

1604
01:43:12,750 --> 01:43:14,660
It's good your sister is dead.

1605
01:43:14,660 --> 01:43:19,700
If she was alive I'd kill her and
make an example out of her.

1606
01:43:19,790 --> 01:43:20,950
Hey Balwant!

1607
01:43:24,500 --> 01:43:26,500
Police! Stop hm!

1608
01:43:28,830 --> 01:43:31,160
-Kaashi!
-Stop him!

1609
01:43:32,450 --> 01:43:33,950
Order, order.

1610
01:43:36,750 --> 01:43:37,950
Pistol?

1611
01:43:38,660 --> 01:43:40,000
He got a pistol.

1612
01:43:40,080 --> 01:43:41,620
Kaashi, order!

1613
01:43:41,790 --> 01:43:43,790
-Kaashi, don't shoot him.
-Kaashi don't take the law in your hands.

1614
01:43:44,200 --> 01:43:45,290
He'll die.

1615
01:43:45,370 --> 01:43:46,160
[Gunshot]

1616
01:43:53,540 --> 01:43:56,870
[Bum bum bhole]

1617
01:44:01,120 --> 01:44:03,120
Says Kaashi.

1618
01:44:15,620 --> 01:44:17,580
-What happened?
-Hey, I'll be back.

1619
01:44:17,580 --> 01:44:18,830
Have your breakfast.

1620
01:44:20,910 --> 01:44:25,500
-Sir where are you going?
-Don't worry, I've got permission.

1621
01:44:25,830 --> 01:44:26,160
Okay.

1622
01:44:35,290 --> 01:44:35,870
Work is done?

1623
01:44:37,370 --> 01:44:37,870
Okay.

1624
01:44:47,750 --> 01:44:49,910
Kaashi, hey Kaashi!

1625
01:44:52,200 --> 01:44:55,000
Wonderful, you look like Radhe
from Tere Naam

1626
01:44:55,200 --> 01:44:55,910
Ditto.

1627
01:44:58,830 --> 01:45:00,750
They turned a good man into a freak.

1628
01:45:02,910 --> 01:45:04,160
What's the word he used in English?

1629
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:06,910
Psycho killer.

1630
01:45:08,200 --> 01:45:12,330
You should be happy, big movie
stars don't get this title.

1631
01:45:13,830 --> 01:45:15,250
Any news on my parents?

1632
01:45:15,950 --> 01:45:20,120
Your parents were visiting temple to
pray for you, they're home now.

1633
01:45:22,540 --> 01:45:24,620
Can I ask you one question?

1634
01:45:25,120 --> 01:45:26,790
If I say no will you not ask!

1635
01:45:33,580 --> 01:45:34,750
-Tell me one thing,
-Yes.

1636
01:45:35,830 --> 01:45:40,830
You've met mum, Ganga and daddy?

1637
01:45:41,540 --> 01:45:43,250
Of course I've met them.

1638
01:45:43,790 --> 01:45:47,410
-I'm doubting things.
-Hey Kaashi.

1639
01:45:48,040 --> 01:45:50,040
Don't let the mental asylum
turn you mental.

1640
01:45:53,750 --> 01:45:54,160
Tell me,

1641
01:45:56,450 --> 01:45:57,450
How does mum look?

1642
01:45:57,910 --> 01:45:58,450
Mum?

1643
01:45:59,910 --> 01:46:01,620
-What sort of question are you asking.
-Tell me,

1644
01:46:03,040 --> 01:46:03,950
How does mum look?

1645
01:46:04,200 --> 01:46:09,330
Mum is old, her hair in the
front are white and is fair.

1646
01:46:09,620 --> 01:46:10,950
-You are right.
-Yes.

1647
01:46:11,290 --> 01:46:14,120
But her two front teeth are
missing, you know that right?

1648
01:46:14,370 --> 01:46:17,910
-Teeth fall as you grow older--
-But have you seen them or not?

1649
01:46:19,750 --> 01:46:20,700
Of course I have seen them.

1650
01:46:26,120 --> 01:46:27,580
Mum has all her teeth, Rangeela.

1651
01:46:50,450 --> 01:46:54,500
Hey brother, your sister Ganga
who you're trying to find is here.

1652
01:46:55,040 --> 01:46:55,660
Have a look.

1653
01:46:56,290 --> 01:46:58,290
You've beaten me black and blue.

1654
01:46:59,040 --> 01:47:03,040
You're getting it wrong this is
not Ganga this is Devina.

1655
01:47:03,250 --> 01:47:08,040
I'm not mistaken this is
your sister Ganga.

1656
01:47:08,200 --> 01:47:12,160
She had come to me to apply for
her and Abhimanyu's wedding.

1657
01:47:12,580 --> 01:47:14,040
And told me her name is Ganga.

1658
01:47:32,950 --> 01:47:34,950
I've never been so happy.

1659
01:47:36,450 --> 01:47:37,450
It is funny.

1660
01:47:40,700 --> 01:47:44,330
For the first time
I'm celebrating my loss.

1661
01:47:45,500 --> 01:47:50,120
Sir, if we feel like winners after a
loss it does call for a celebration.

1662
01:47:50,790 --> 01:47:52,040
-Devina.
-Sister,

1663
01:47:52,160 --> 01:47:53,040
-What are you thinking?
-Come here.

1664
01:47:53,160 --> 01:47:54,830
Let's celebrate our victory.

1665
01:47:55,830 --> 01:47:56,250
Take.

1666
01:48:00,910 --> 01:48:03,620
-Cheers to our victory.
-Yay! Cheers!

1667
01:48:07,080 --> 01:48:09,080
I feel like a loser even after we've won.

1668
01:48:10,910 --> 01:48:12,000
Why sister?

1669
01:48:12,950 --> 01:48:13,580
Kaashi!

1670
01:48:16,200 --> 01:48:18,830
-I don't know I feel bad for him.
-Look, Devina,

1671
01:48:20,540 --> 01:48:24,950
In a war it is always the
pawn who is sacrificed.

1672
01:48:25,580 --> 01:48:28,250
-Kaashi wasn't a pawn.
-Then what was he?

1673
01:48:28,950 --> 01:48:30,950
Didi, are you in love with him?

1674
01:48:36,080 --> 01:48:40,200
Devina, don't be an emotional fool
and fall in love.

1675
01:48:41,370 --> 01:48:44,080
You've escaped charges very narrowly.

1676
01:48:45,790 --> 01:48:48,370
A little sloppiness on your part
will sink all of our boats.

1677
01:48:51,950 --> 01:48:54,450
I was never emotionally attached
like this to anyone before.

1678
01:48:56,700 --> 01:49:00,540
I never realised when I got so
attached to Kaashi.

1679
01:49:00,620 --> 01:49:02,160
But what will you do now?

1680
01:49:02,660 --> 01:49:04,750
Kaashi is locked behind bars forever.

1681
01:49:05,500 --> 01:49:10,200
I'll get him out and get him treated
by the world's best doctors.

1682
01:49:11,080 --> 01:49:12,500
It's too late sis.

1683
01:49:12,790 --> 01:49:14,790
You can't do anything--have you thought

1684
01:49:15,500 --> 01:49:17,250
What will happen when
Kaashi learns of the truth?

1685
01:49:17,790 --> 01:49:18,950
I'll tell him myself.

1686
01:49:21,330 --> 01:49:22,410
He'll forgive me.

1687
01:49:27,660 --> 01:49:28,620
Kaashi,

1688
01:49:29,790 --> 01:49:30,870
Someone's come to meet you.

1689
01:50:10,500 --> 01:50:11,500
How are you Kaashi?

1690
01:50:12,790 --> 01:50:13,290
How am I?

1691
01:50:15,660 --> 01:50:16,040
The same,

1692
01:50:17,950 --> 01:50:18,370
A crazy freak.

1693
01:50:26,370 --> 01:50:27,410
You knew it all along.

1694
01:50:35,500 --> 01:50:36,370
I'm sorry Kaashi!

1695
01:50:41,500 --> 01:50:43,660
I tried everything to save you.

1696
01:50:46,500 --> 01:50:47,660
I loved you.

1697
01:50:50,950 --> 01:50:51,700
This is what I get in return?

1698
01:50:55,330 --> 01:50:56,580
I was leading a good life.

1699
01:50:59,500 --> 01:51:01,000
You destroyed my life.

1700
01:51:02,700 --> 01:51:03,450
Why!

1701
01:51:08,330 --> 01:51:09,040
Why?

1702
01:51:11,660 --> 01:51:14,160
I'd come to Banaras with a purpose,

1703
01:51:15,160 --> 01:51:16,330
and then I saw you.

1704
01:51:22,750 --> 01:51:24,330
My interview. Why?

1705
01:51:24,910 --> 01:51:28,080
Because with you I can
explore the soul of Banaras.

1706
01:51:30,580 --> 01:51:31,330
This is my father.

1707
01:51:34,370 --> 01:51:36,080
There was a lot of work today.

1708
01:51:38,160 --> 01:51:40,910
I understood that very day
what problem you had.

1709
01:51:41,660 --> 01:51:44,830
I decided you were the perfect
man for my mission.

1710
01:51:45,540 --> 01:51:49,160
And like a psychoanalyst I
got control over you.

1711
01:51:53,200 --> 01:51:56,370
I saw you loved Ganga deeply.

1712
01:51:56,620 --> 01:51:58,620
You love Ganga a lot, don't you?

1713
01:51:59,500 --> 01:52:01,250
She is my whole life.

1714
01:52:01,330 --> 01:52:03,330
I turned your brain against you

1715
01:52:03,910 --> 01:52:08,160
and took away the one thing
that you valued the most.

1716
01:52:13,080 --> 01:52:14,290
The girl Shruti that you met,

1717
01:52:15,580 --> 01:52:18,000
as Ganga's friend,

1718
01:52:19,290 --> 01:52:20,750
is my sister.

1719
01:52:21,370 --> 01:52:23,370
But sister, what do I have to do?

1720
01:52:24,290 --> 01:52:27,200
You have to be Ganga's friend
and narrate a story.

1721
01:52:27,540 --> 01:52:28,910
The story will be mine.

1722
01:52:31,290 --> 01:52:36,160
And she narrated a fake love
story of Ganga and Abhimnayu.

1723
01:52:38,830 --> 01:52:40,000
And you believed it.

1724
01:52:40,950 --> 01:52:44,500
I went to Lucknow on purpose
and sent you to the court.

1725
01:52:45,040 --> 01:52:45,750
Yes madam.

1726
01:52:46,750 --> 01:52:49,250
I want to register a
marriage application.

1727
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:56,160
Name of the man?

1728
01:52:56,500 --> 01:52:59,830
-Abhimanyu Pandey.
-Hmm and yours?

1729
01:53:01,500 --> 01:53:02,410
Ganga Chaudhary.

1730
01:53:03,750 --> 01:53:05,450
Ganga Chaudhary.

1731
01:53:07,660 --> 01:53:15,040
To strengthen your belief on my story
I even had shots fired on us outside Balwant's home.

1732
01:53:15,750 --> 01:53:17,750
And I even met Rangeela.

1733
01:53:17,950 --> 01:53:21,540
Rangeela, Kaashi's mental health
is deteriorating by the day.

1734
01:53:22,250 --> 01:53:25,250
He now thinks Ganga has disappeared.

1735
01:53:26,410 --> 01:53:28,080
We have to take care off him.

1736
01:53:28,620 --> 01:53:32,080
Otherwise generally in this
condition a man gets very violent.

1737
01:53:33,540 --> 01:53:36,700
This is why Kaashi belted
Babina and his friends so hard.

1738
01:53:36,750 --> 01:53:37,450
Oh God.

1739
01:53:37,450 --> 01:53:40,290
What should we do in
this situation, Madam ji?

1740
01:53:40,870 --> 01:53:44,160
You and your friends do as I say.

1741
01:53:44,700 --> 01:53:47,410
Otherwise Kaashi will be in real trouble.

1742
01:53:48,250 --> 01:53:50,410
I'm in touch with the doctor at all time.

1743
01:53:51,370 --> 01:53:53,410
Madam ji, all of us will do as you say.

1744
01:53:56,870 --> 01:53:57,410
And...

1745
01:53:58,790 --> 01:54:00,540
the dead body we found of Ganga?

1746
01:54:02,200 --> 01:54:03,160
That was staged too,

1747
01:54:07,950 --> 01:54:08,410
What's this for?

1748
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,500
I need an unidentified
dead body, of a girl.

1749
01:54:14,790 --> 01:54:16,000
Unidentified dead body?

1750
01:54:16,870 --> 01:54:17,160
Why?

1751
01:54:18,540 --> 01:54:21,660
You have to dress the dead body
in the clothes I give you.

1752
01:54:22,660 --> 01:54:25,200
And leave the dead body at a random place.

1753
01:54:28,500 --> 01:54:31,000
Madam this is risky work,
I'll need more money.

1754
01:54:32,450 --> 01:54:35,330
This is 10,000,
Remaining after the work is done.

1755
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:39,410
And yes, I'll send the clothes over.

1756
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:44,660
The clothes that I bought for Ganga,
I handed over to Babina.

1757
01:54:47,120 --> 01:54:48,080
Chuman chacha,

1758
01:54:48,580 --> 01:54:49,790
Babina's friends,

1759
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:52,660
Were all telling the truth Kaashi.

1760
01:54:53,700 --> 01:54:55,410
You turned an innocent man,

1761
01:54:57,450 --> 01:54:58,500
into a killer.

1762
01:55:00,870 --> 01:55:01,580
Why?

1763
01:55:02,040 --> 01:55:02,700
Revenge!

1764
01:55:04,370 --> 01:55:05,830
I wanted revenge from Balwant.

1765
01:55:06,370 --> 01:55:07,370
What revenge?

1766
01:55:10,200 --> 01:55:13,830
Balwant, was my dad's business partner.

1767
01:55:15,080 --> 01:55:17,370
I was around eight years at the time.

1768
01:55:18,950 --> 01:55:26,910
To take over our property he killed
my dad and brother as well.

1769
01:55:56,500 --> 01:56:00,080
Me, Shruti and mother escaped.

1770
01:56:02,370 --> 01:56:03,790
After 15 years,

1771
01:56:04,450 --> 01:56:07,580
I avenged the death of
my brother and father.

1772
01:56:12,910 --> 01:56:18,040
So what the guard said was also a lie?

1773
01:56:18,580 --> 01:56:19,330
Yes Kaashi.

1774
01:56:21,160 --> 01:56:24,540
The guard told you what
I wanted you to know.

1775
01:56:25,160 --> 01:56:28,500
Just as fate would have it
Balwant and his son died the same way,

1776
01:56:29,540 --> 01:56:31,450
My dad and brother died.

1777
01:56:33,080 --> 01:56:35,830
When you were arguing
in court with Balwant

1778
01:56:37,500 --> 01:56:38,330
It was me.

1779
01:56:51,830 --> 01:56:52,870
You did great.

1780
01:56:55,330 --> 01:56:55,870
Kaashi...

1781
01:56:59,830 --> 01:57:02,000
I fell in love with you

1782
01:57:03,370 --> 01:57:05,910
and you murdered my trust.

1783
01:57:08,500 --> 01:57:11,580
The world will lose its
believe in love madam.

1784
01:57:12,700 --> 01:57:13,660
No, Kaashi.

1785
01:57:15,250 --> 01:57:16,750
I do love you.

1786
01:57:17,330 --> 01:57:18,750
I won't let anything happen to you.

1787
01:57:20,080 --> 01:57:24,370
-I loved you then like I do now--
-One more lie.

1788
01:57:24,870 --> 01:57:26,950
-No.
-I don't want your love.

1789
01:57:29,500 --> 01:57:31,540
Who do you want to kill now huh?

1790
01:57:32,290 --> 01:57:34,660
Kaashi I'm not lying.

1791
01:57:34,660 --> 01:57:36,660
-Please.
-What do you think?

1792
01:57:37,040 --> 01:57:39,830
Your crocodile tears won't move me.

1793
01:57:40,160 --> 01:57:41,540
Stop this drama.

1794
01:57:47,370 --> 01:57:48,910
I'm not lying.

1795
01:57:49,830 --> 01:57:53,620
No, no don't cry, no.

1796
01:57:54,160 --> 01:57:54,620
Don't cry.

1797
01:57:55,080 --> 01:57:55,540
Don't cry.

1798
01:57:58,660 --> 01:58:00,120
I've burnt bodies my whole life,

1799
01:58:02,040 --> 01:58:04,040
It has never mattered to me
when anyone has cried before

1800
01:58:05,040 --> 01:58:07,040
Your tears makes a difference,

1801
01:58:08,660 --> 01:58:09,540
Do you know why?

1802
01:58:11,620 --> 01:58:13,410
Because I love you.

1803
01:58:18,870 --> 01:58:20,870
-I love you a lot.
-Sorry Kaashi.

1804
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:22,000
Sorry Kaashi.

1805
01:58:22,660 --> 01:58:26,080
-I love you a lot.
-Please forgive me.

1806
01:58:30,290 --> 01:58:32,290
And I also know you love me.

1807
01:58:34,120 --> 01:58:38,660
Never knew life would play
such a crude game with the both of us.

1808
01:58:40,750 --> 01:58:42,580
Mummy, Daddy and Ganga.

1809
01:58:45,330 --> 01:58:46,290
You took away everyone.

1810
01:58:47,790 --> 01:58:48,450
Sorry.

1811
01:58:49,080 --> 01:58:51,080
Even then I want to live with you.

1812
01:58:53,660 --> 01:58:56,620
I swear on Mahadev I
want to live with you.

1813
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:05,000
But Mahadev doesn't agree.

1814
01:59:05,200 --> 01:59:06,500
No, no.

1815
01:59:07,410 --> 01:59:09,580
-And what Mahadev wills always happens.
-No, No.

1816
01:59:09,950 --> 01:59:11,580
No no Kaashi.

1817
01:59:13,410 --> 01:59:16,290
And whatever Mahadev wills
cannot be escaped.

1818
02:00:05,870 --> 02:00:08,790
Don't know what he does
always banging that spoon.

1819
02:00:34,910 --> 02:00:36,540
Ask mum how much time for dinner?

1820
02:00:37,370 --> 02:00:40,540
And listen we've promised Ganga
so we have to take her.

1821
02:00:41,250 --> 02:00:43,250
And please tell Dad to not stress me out.

1822
02:00:43,700 --> 02:00:44,580
I'm very tired.

1823
02:00:45,870 --> 02:00:46,830
My head's spinning

1824
02:00:47,290 --> 02:00:48,120
will you massage it?

1825
02:00:51,950 --> 02:00:52,540
A little on this side.

1826
02:00:54,620 --> 02:00:56,620
We'll go to the market with Ganga.

1827
02:00:57,290 --> 02:01:01,790
Buy as many as you want when we go.

1828
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:02,790
Okay?

1829
02:01:11,830 --> 02:01:12,500
Kaashi.
