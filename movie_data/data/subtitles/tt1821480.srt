00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:04,467
Passengers are advised..

5
00:04:04,502 --> 00:04:08,268
..to inform the Metro
Police on finding..

6
00:04:08,406 --> 00:04:10,874
..any unidentified
box or alien object.

7
00:04:28,526 --> 00:04:30,687
The door is closing.

8
00:04:36,033 --> 00:04:37,022
Hello.

9
00:04:37,335 --> 00:04:38,495
Yes, I am on the train.

10
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:40,301
Which bag?

11
00:04:40,972 --> 00:04:42,064
Speak louder.

12
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:43,739
Which bag?

13
00:04:43,808 --> 00:04:46,868
Next station Ravindra Station.

14
00:04:47,411 --> 00:04:49,606
Platform on the right hand side.

15
00:05:06,564 --> 00:05:07,758
Why is she crying so much?

16
00:05:07,865 --> 00:05:09,025
She's hungry.

17
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:10,561
Why don't you feed her?

18
00:05:10,668 --> 00:05:12,966
I forgot her milk bottle at home.

19
00:05:13,437 --> 00:05:16,031
Yesterday I bought a new game,
Call Of Duty: Black Ops.

20
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:18,274
What a game. Great graphics.

21
00:05:18,376 --> 00:05:19,866
Look, there's Kushal.

22
00:05:25,516 --> 00:05:27,507
Kushal, why are you so scared.

23
00:05:27,818 --> 00:05:29,911
Give it. Give the bag.
Why are you scared?

24
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:32,782
What are you hiding in your bag?
Is it something special?

25
00:05:35,059 --> 00:05:37,493
What are you hiding in your bag?

26
00:05:37,595 --> 00:05:38,653
Give the bag. Give the bag.

27
00:05:38,729 --> 00:05:40,697
We are not throwing it away.

28
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,024
Give it, give the bag.

29
00:05:44,902 --> 00:05:46,301
I will go back home.

30
00:05:47,004 --> 00:05:49,666
Come on. Come on, let's go.

31
00:05:50,908 --> 00:05:52,034
Show me the bag.

32
00:05:56,714 --> 00:05:59,774
Hey, you left your bag behind.

33
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:01,784
The milk bottle is right here.

34
00:06:34,552 --> 00:06:37,350
More than 100 are expected to be dead..

35
00:06:37,421 --> 00:06:39,286
..in Kolkata Metro Rail due
to the deadly gas attack.

36
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:43,356
Its believed that a terrorist
group is behind this attack.

37
00:06:48,566 --> 00:06:51,433
Even on the third day passengers
are hesitating to travel by the Metro.

38
00:06:53,938 --> 00:06:56,600
The relatives of those..

39
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,437
..who died in the gas attack
staged a rally in Kolkata today.

40
00:06:58,476 --> 00:06:59,807
And requested the government..

41
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:02,004
..to find out who is
responsible for this attack.

42
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:04,605
Madam.

43
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:18,887
Madam.

44
00:08:21,559 --> 00:08:22,856
Madam. Madam. Come with me.

45
00:08:22,927 --> 00:08:23,951
Who are you?

46
00:08:24,261 --> 00:08:25,250
What do you want?

47
00:08:26,397 --> 00:08:28,865
Move, move.

48
00:08:29,834 --> 00:08:31,825
You shouldn't lift heavy
objects in such a condition..

49
00:08:31,869 --> 00:08:33,302
Move. Go away.

50
00:08:33,337 --> 00:08:35,703
You shouldn't lift heavy
objects in such a condition.

51
00:08:36,407 --> 00:08:37,431
Let me, let me.

52
00:08:37,508 --> 00:08:38,566
Leave it.

53
00:08:38,642 --> 00:08:40,269
I know, I have a kid too.

54
00:08:42,346 --> 00:08:43,574
Let me, madam. Please.

55
00:08:44,548 --> 00:08:45,845
Move aside. Move.

56
00:08:46,016 --> 00:08:47,278
You are taking my passenger.

57
00:08:48,619 --> 00:08:49,779
Please move.

58
00:09:14,812 --> 00:09:16,677
Don't mind, madam. But
can I ask you something?

59
00:09:17,448 --> 00:09:19,245
I have been driving a
taxi for the past 15 years.

60
00:09:19,917 --> 00:09:22,886
Every passenger either goes home
or to the hotel from the airport.

61
00:09:22,987 --> 00:09:26,320
You are the first passenger who is
going straight to a police station.

62
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,557
Get the tea quickly.

63
00:09:32,329 --> 00:09:34,524
Press any key.

64
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:39,495
It's up, it's up, it's up..

65
00:09:39,603 --> 00:09:40,968
Here it is.

66
00:09:44,475 --> 00:09:45,407
It's here.

67
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:47,504
It's working!

68
00:09:47,611 --> 00:09:48,805
It's shut down again.

69
00:09:48,913 --> 00:09:49,902
What happened now?

70
00:09:50,547 --> 00:09:52,879
That's what his wife
must be saying every night.

71
00:09:55,953 --> 00:09:57,614
Sign here.

72
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:35,455
Madam, here's the police station.

73
00:10:38,696 --> 00:10:39,754
How much?

74
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:50,429
Here's your bag.

75
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:54,637
Madam, this is my number.

76
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:58,847
If you ever need a taxi, call me.

77
00:11:01,018 --> 00:11:02,042
Thank you.

78
00:11:07,658 --> 00:11:09,853
Where do I go to file a
missing person's report?

79
00:11:10,427 --> 00:11:13,590
Yes, you go.. I..

80
00:11:13,764 --> 00:11:16,824
Just go straight.. I mean,
it's just straight ahead.

81
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:17,889
Thank you.

82
00:11:18,535 --> 00:11:19,866
Shall I carry this?

83
00:11:20,637 --> 00:11:21,296
Thanks.

84
00:11:21,405 --> 00:11:21,996
It's okay.

85
00:11:24,842 --> 00:11:26,309
My husband is missing.

86
00:11:33,884 --> 00:11:35,351
Are you coming from out of town?

87
00:11:36,353 --> 00:11:37,377
London.

88
00:11:37,454 --> 00:11:38,045
You arrived just now?

89
00:11:38,455 --> 00:11:39,479
Yes.

90
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:42,726
Madam.

91
00:11:43,894 --> 00:11:46,658
We will need some details.

92
00:11:47,831 --> 00:11:48,957
Actually, a month ago..

93
00:11:49,033 --> 00:11:50,000
Tea.

94
00:11:51,869 --> 00:11:52,801
Will you have tea?

95
00:11:52,903 --> 00:11:53,801
No.

96
00:11:54,738 --> 00:11:55,602
Yes, go ahead.

97
00:11:55,706 --> 00:11:58,504
He came to Kolkata a month ago.

98
00:11:58,609 --> 00:12:00,600
He had a two week assignment
in the National Data Centre.

99
00:12:00,711 --> 00:12:01,302
Okay.

100
00:12:01,378 --> 00:12:03,312
First two weeks we
would talk every day.

101
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:04,813
Then he suddenly stopped calling.

102
00:12:04,915 --> 00:12:06,610
No messages or anything.

103
00:12:06,683 --> 00:12:08,776
And I didn't know what to do.

104
00:12:08,886 --> 00:12:10,717
So I came here directly. I..

105
00:12:10,788 --> 00:12:12,619
Speak softly.

106
00:12:13,323 --> 00:12:14,756
Doesn't my time have any value?

107
00:12:14,858 --> 00:12:15,756
Why are you screaming?

108
00:12:15,859 --> 00:12:17,724
No need to shout. He
can hear you clearly.

109
00:12:19,863 --> 00:12:20,591
Your name.

110
00:12:20,898 --> 00:12:21,922
Vidya Bagchi.

111
00:12:22,466 --> 00:12:23,933
Bidya Bagchi.

112
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:26,502
No, it's Vidya. With a V.

113
00:12:26,904 --> 00:12:30,863
Madam, in Kolkata Vidya,
Bidya .. same feelings

114
00:12:31,608 --> 00:12:32,404
Isn't it, Rana?

115
00:12:32,509 --> 00:12:32,941
What?

116
00:12:33,077 --> 00:12:34,567
Vidya, Bidya are all
the same, isn't it?

117
00:12:37,614 --> 00:12:39,013
Your husband's name?

118
00:12:39,316 --> 00:12:39,839
Arnab.

119
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:40,712
Bagchi?

120
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:44,612
Arnab..

121
00:12:45,522 --> 00:12:48,082
Stop messing with it Rana

122
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:49,957
Sorry.

123
00:12:49,993 --> 00:12:51,085
And age?

124
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:52,054
33.

125
00:12:53,664 --> 00:12:54,358
Complexion.

126
00:12:54,465 --> 00:12:55,454
Wheatish.

127
00:12:55,766 --> 00:12:56,790
Height?

128
00:12:58,068 --> 00:12:59,535
A little taller than this.

129
00:12:59,837 --> 00:13:01,429
5'11?

130
00:13:03,774 --> 00:13:05,401
Do you have a photograph?

131
00:13:05,476 --> 00:13:05,771
Yes.

132
00:13:05,876 --> 00:13:07,639
Doesn't my case have any value?

133
00:13:07,778 --> 00:13:08,574
Doesn't my case have any value?

134
00:13:08,612 --> 00:13:09,044
Softly. Softly.

135
00:13:09,313 --> 00:13:09,870
What softly?

136
00:13:09,913 --> 00:13:11,676
You will speak softly or
else I will throw you out.

137
00:13:11,782 --> 00:13:13,647
He is listening to
what you are saying.

138
00:13:20,891 --> 00:13:21,789
Love marriage.

139
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,321
Is this a year old?

140
00:13:25,863 --> 00:13:26,727
No, two years.

141
00:13:27,331 --> 00:13:28,298
Don't you have a latest one?

142
00:13:30,868 --> 00:13:34,770
No.. Arnab didn't like
to get his pictures taken.

143
00:13:34,872 --> 00:13:37,432
Isn't it enough that we
ran away and got married?

144
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:38,439
Now we have to get a
picture taken as well.

145
00:13:38,542 --> 00:13:41,909
Come here. Otherwise what's
the proof that you married me?

146
00:13:41,979 --> 00:13:43,674
It was the day we got married..

147
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:45,338
..so I forced him to
get our picture taken.

148
00:13:45,482 --> 00:13:46,039
I see.

149
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,418
What does your husband do?

150
00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:49,952
We both were software engineers.

151
00:13:50,087 --> 00:13:51,076
Firewall experts.

152
00:13:51,355 --> 00:13:52,652
Firewall?

153
00:13:52,723 --> 00:13:57,660
We make programs to save
computers from virus attacks.

154
00:13:57,728 --> 00:14:01,960
Like, the police..
protects the public. Right?

155
00:14:02,366 --> 00:14:03,560
Get this done quickly.

156
00:14:03,834 --> 00:14:07,497
Arnab was supposed to come to London
after the assignment, but he didn't.

157
00:14:07,971 --> 00:14:09,700
He suddenly vanished.

158
00:14:09,773 --> 00:14:10,398
Vanished?

159
00:14:10,507 --> 00:14:13,476
Yes, I mean no messages, no calls.

160
00:14:13,577 --> 00:14:15,306
And Arnab isn't like that.

161
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:17,413
Where was he staying here?

162
00:14:19,616 --> 00:14:23,052
Mona Lisa, 172A
- Sarat Bose Road.

163
00:14:23,453 --> 00:14:24,852
The place where he worked name?

164
00:14:24,955 --> 00:14:25,785
National Data Centre.

165
00:14:25,889 --> 00:14:26,378
Yes.

166
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,924
But they said that Arnab never
came there for any assignment.

167
00:14:29,593 --> 00:14:31,322
He did, I know.

168
00:14:31,461 --> 00:14:33,053
We talked every day.

169
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:37,430
He would call me a thousand
times in a day and I would scold him.

170
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:39,901
So that he doesn't spend his
entire earning on the phone bill.

171
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:41,528
But I don't know why they are lying.

172
00:14:44,775 --> 00:14:46,367
The case is slightly complicated.

173
00:14:46,543 --> 00:14:48,408
I will do my best. It will be done.

174
00:14:48,478 --> 00:14:49,968
It will take some time.
I will get it done.

175
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:55,712
Madam, you will need to sign this.

176
00:14:56,019 --> 00:14:57,350
Sign, sign.

177
00:14:57,621 --> 00:14:59,816
Why are you after that thing?

178
00:14:59,923 --> 00:15:01,322
Leave it.

179
00:15:01,391 --> 00:15:02,688
May I help?

180
00:15:03,927 --> 00:15:04,916
You?

181
00:15:04,995 --> 00:15:07,486
Oh yes, you are a computer person..

182
00:15:07,598 --> 00:15:08,895
Take a look.

183
00:15:11,468 --> 00:15:13,402
What a pain..

184
00:15:18,575 --> 00:15:20,304
You just needed to clear some memory.

185
00:15:20,611 --> 00:15:21,908
You won't face any problem now.

186
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,346
Are you satisfied now?

187
00:15:24,815 --> 00:15:26,646
Now, madam, you just need to
sign and you're free to go.

188
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:30,781
What happened, madam?

189
00:15:30,854 --> 00:15:32,014
Sit, sit.

190
00:15:34,491 --> 00:15:35,788
Would you like some water?

191
00:15:36,593 --> 00:15:38,561
Will you call a taxi for me, please?

192
00:15:38,629 --> 00:15:40,824
Why, Taxi? Rana will drop you.

193
00:15:40,931 --> 00:15:43,957
Rana, go drop her. Go.

194
00:15:44,034 --> 00:15:45,296
Come.

195
00:15:58,915 --> 00:16:00,439
How much further?

196
00:16:00,817 --> 00:16:02,011
Its close-by.

197
00:16:06,723 --> 00:16:08,247
Are you feeling better now?

198
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:13,593
Is this your first visit to Kolkata?

199
00:16:13,664 --> 00:16:14,824
Yes.

200
00:16:19,403 --> 00:16:21,428
Entire Kolkata is getting
ready for the Puja, right.

201
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:24,672
So you know about 'Durga Puja'?

202
00:16:25,542 --> 00:16:28,010
I have a Bengali husband remember..

203
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:33,975
By the way, your name Vidya is
also a very common Bengali name.

204
00:16:34,651 --> 00:16:35,618
Vidya.

205
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,487
I know.

206
00:16:37,587 --> 00:16:38,815
Courtesy Mr. Chatterjee.

207
00:16:39,923 --> 00:16:41,652
By the way, why do they call you Rana?

208
00:16:42,059 --> 00:16:45,324
Your name.. The name
tag reads Satyoki.

209
00:16:46,029 --> 00:16:48,827
In Kolkata everyone has two names.

210
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:51,390
One is 'Dak' name, which is
pet name like mine is Rana.

211
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:54,301
And the other is
'Bhalo' name, official name.

212
00:16:54,371 --> 00:16:55,030
Satyoki.

213
00:16:55,405 --> 00:16:57,532
But everyone
addresses me by my pet name.

214
00:16:58,742 --> 00:17:02,803
Interesting. Two names
for the same person.

215
00:17:03,246 --> 00:17:04,577
Two identities.

216
00:17:07,284 --> 00:17:10,742
Satyoki. Arjun's charioteer.

217
00:17:17,027 --> 00:17:18,426
Guesthouse?

218
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:19,587
Have we reached the hotel?

219
00:17:19,963 --> 00:17:22,022
Mrs. Bagchi, this
doesn't look like a hotel.

220
00:17:39,483 --> 00:17:40,711
Are you sure this is the place?

221
00:17:40,784 --> 00:17:41,978
That's the address.

222
00:17:43,987 --> 00:17:45,818
Why would your husband stay here?

223
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:48,382
I don't know.

224
00:17:48,592 --> 00:17:49,684
Come.

225
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:15,914
Good evening. Are
you the manager here?

226
00:18:15,986 --> 00:18:17,647
Yes.

227
00:18:17,821 --> 00:18:20,346
I am Vidya Bagchi. I had
called you from London..

228
00:18:20,457 --> 00:18:21,890
..about my husband Arnab.

229
00:18:22,025 --> 00:18:23,754
Yes, yes. Arnab Bagchi.

230
00:18:24,594 --> 00:18:25,652
Your Majesty, you..

231
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:26,855
Look, I am not the queen.

232
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:28,488
You can call me Vidya.

233
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:32,300
Bidya madam, when you
called from London..

234
00:18:32,335 --> 00:18:35,896
..I told you that your
husband wasn't staying here.

235
00:18:35,972 --> 00:18:37,803
The situation is
still the same. Arnab..

236
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:39,375
You've been saying
that all the while..

237
00:18:39,843 --> 00:18:41,037
..and that's exactly why I came here.

238
00:18:41,311 --> 00:18:44,576
I know this because he would
talk to me everyday from right here.

239
00:18:44,648 --> 00:18:45,808
Sir, please explain to her..

240
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:46,814
Wait, wait.

241
00:18:46,983 --> 00:18:48,951
Mrs. Bagchi, maybe
there's a confusion.

242
00:18:48,985 --> 00:18:50,612
There's absolutely no confusion.

243
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,812
Arnab was staying here.

244
00:18:51,888 --> 00:18:53,913
This man is lying.
Show me your records.

245
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:55,355
Register. Get the register.

246
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:01,394
This.

247
00:19:02,499 --> 00:19:03,557
Are these your records?

248
00:19:03,633 --> 00:19:04,429
Yes.

249
00:19:04,501 --> 00:19:05,661
Don't you have a computer?

250
00:19:06,269 --> 00:19:07,293
Computer?

251
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:09,702
Madam, only 5-star
hotels have computers.

252
00:19:09,806 --> 00:19:11,000
This is a guesthouse.

253
00:19:11,308 --> 00:19:12,366
0-star.

254
00:19:15,345 --> 00:19:17,279
Arnab stayed here
and I can prove that.

255
00:19:17,681 --> 00:19:19,478
If you walk towards the lift..

256
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:20,641
..there's a peacock statue there.

257
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:21,739
Arnab used to say that..

258
00:19:21,818 --> 00:19:23,979
..The peacock of Tamil Nadu
has followed me here too.

259
00:19:24,488 --> 00:19:25,386
Which way is the lift?

260
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:26,756
That way.

261
00:19:27,757 --> 00:19:28,416
Is it or not?

262
00:19:28,492 --> 00:19:28,924
There is.

263
00:19:29,025 --> 00:19:29,616
Then?

264
00:19:29,693 --> 00:19:30,717
There is a peacock.

265
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:32,523
But your husband isn't here.

266
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:33,459
I mean, he wasn't.

267
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:34,758
You think this is a joke?

268
00:19:34,831 --> 00:19:36,025
The peacock's really there.

269
00:19:36,566 --> 00:19:37,430
But how do you know?

270
00:19:37,501 --> 00:19:38,490
Exactly.

271
00:19:38,702 --> 00:19:41,728
If Arnab didn't tell me
about it, then how do I know?

272
00:19:41,938 --> 00:19:44,338
I don't know why everyone's lying.

273
00:19:44,407 --> 00:19:46,841
What, sir? Talk to me.

274
00:19:47,043 --> 00:19:48,738
Arnab wasn't staying here, right?

275
00:19:48,845 --> 00:19:49,777
But I will.

276
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,370
I will stay in room no.15.

277
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:52,641
Mrs. Bagchi, are you sure.

278
00:19:52,716 --> 00:19:54,343
I am absolutely sure.

279
00:19:54,451 --> 00:19:55,543
Will you give me the key?

280
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:00,717
Sign here.

281
00:20:02,292 --> 00:20:02,986
Here?

282
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:05,712
My dear wife, Why are
you standing at the door?

283
00:22:05,815 --> 00:22:06,907
You are so late

284
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:09,814
I've been waiting for so long
even your phone was unreachable.

285
00:22:09,886 --> 00:22:11,444
And what if I hadn't returned?

286
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:14,584
Then I would've kept waiting..

287
00:23:46,549 --> 00:23:47,846
It started raining suddenly.

288
00:23:47,917 --> 00:23:49,043
Business is down.

289
00:23:49,319 --> 00:23:49,808
Absolutely.

290
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:50,511
Exactly.

291
00:23:51,321 --> 00:23:52,982
Your maj.. No.

292
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:54,421
Good morning, Bidya madam.

293
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:55,918
Its Vidya, not Bidya.

294
00:23:55,992 --> 00:23:57,459
V, not B.

295
00:23:57,527 --> 00:23:58,789
Whatever you say, Bidya madam.

296
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:01,363
There's no hot water in the room.

297
00:24:01,397 --> 00:24:01,761
I know.

298
00:24:01,831 --> 00:24:03,423
You.. You know.

299
00:24:03,767 --> 00:24:05,962
Then why did you put up a
board saying 'Running hot-water'.

300
00:24:07,704 --> 00:24:08,602
That?

301
00:24:08,705 --> 00:24:09,603
I tell you.

302
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:11,396
Bishnu. Bishnu.

303
00:24:12,008 --> 00:24:13,475
Come here. Come here.

304
00:24:13,777 --> 00:24:14,641
Come.

305
00:24:14,677 --> 00:24:15,837
Madam, he's Bishnu.

306
00:24:16,613 --> 00:24:18,945
If you want hot
water then call Bishnu.

307
00:24:19,015 --> 00:24:21,006
He will come running
with the hot water.

308
00:24:21,317 --> 00:24:23,410
Running hot water ..our Bishnu.

309
00:24:25,388 --> 00:24:28,380
How do I go to Camac Street?

310
00:24:28,591 --> 00:24:30,354
You will get a bus, or a taxi outside.

311
00:24:30,393 --> 00:24:31,826
Bishnu, show madam.

312
00:24:31,895 --> 00:24:32,486
Come Didi.

313
00:24:32,595 --> 00:24:33,027
Come on.

314
00:24:33,329 --> 00:24:33,818
What is that?

315
00:24:34,297 --> 00:24:34,922
Don't ask for that.

316
00:24:35,031 --> 00:24:37,625
That's his radio. His life.
He will never give it.

317
00:24:38,401 --> 00:24:39,390
Come on.

318
00:24:39,803 --> 00:24:41,361
You called me Didi right?

319
00:24:41,437 --> 00:24:42,768
So that makes my brother right?

320
00:24:42,872 --> 00:24:44,737
Give me a five, brother.

321
00:25:11,668 --> 00:25:12,362
Good morning, sir.

322
00:25:12,435 --> 00:25:13,333
Good morning.

323
00:25:13,369 --> 00:25:14,700
Please call Mrs. Bagchi.

324
00:25:14,938 --> 00:25:16,405
Madam left for Camel street.

325
00:25:16,639 --> 00:25:19,437
Hi. I am here to meet Agnes D'mello.

326
00:25:19,509 --> 00:25:20,498
Do you have an appointment?

327
00:25:20,577 --> 00:25:21,373
Yes.

328
00:25:21,611 --> 00:25:22,737
Your name, madam?

329
00:25:23,446 --> 00:25:24,378
Vidya Bagchi.

330
00:25:24,414 --> 00:25:27,440
Bidya Bagchi.

331
00:25:28,885 --> 00:25:29,943
Nothing.

332
00:25:31,888 --> 00:25:33,355
Bidya Bagchi.

333
00:25:44,701 --> 00:25:47,670
Darling, I told you this
when you called me from London.

334
00:25:48,071 --> 00:25:52,508
Your husband didn't come to
my company for any assignment.

335
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:54,833
I am the HR manager.

336
00:25:55,378 --> 00:25:58,040
I approve every assignment.

337
00:25:58,481 --> 00:26:02,918
And I didn't sanction any
assignment for any Arnab Bagchi.

338
00:26:07,757 --> 00:26:08,746
Arnab.

339
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:13,026
No. He didn't come here.

340
00:26:13,296 --> 00:26:14,957
He did. I sent him.

341
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:16,627
I don't want to go to Kolkata.

342
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,828
I am on a holiday.

343
00:26:19,302 --> 00:26:21,497
It's just a question of
two weeks, I'll be okay.

344
00:26:21,804 --> 00:26:23,362
You're crying like a girl

345
00:26:25,575 --> 00:26:26,940
You are actually packing my bag.

346
00:26:28,978 --> 00:26:31,469
Wifey, please. They
will find someone else.

347
00:26:31,614 --> 00:26:33,912
And I will stay right
here and look after you.

348
00:26:34,284 --> 00:26:35,979
Cooking, washing.

349
00:26:37,553 --> 00:26:38,884
That's what I am afraid of.

350
00:26:39,789 --> 00:26:41,882
I will be okay, go.

351
00:26:51,301 --> 00:26:52,461
Please help me Didi..

352
00:26:52,735 --> 00:26:53,827
Please help me.

353
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:55,734
I don't know what to do.

354
00:26:56,472 --> 00:26:56,938
Yes!

355
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,508
There's a police
officer who wants to see you.

356
00:26:59,609 --> 00:27:00,576
Me?

357
00:27:05,581 --> 00:27:06,240
Bye.

358
00:27:06,683 --> 00:27:07,411
Bye.

359
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:09,407
Poor girl.

360
00:28:23,426 --> 00:28:24,552
Mrs. Bagchi.

361
00:28:26,629 --> 00:28:27,789
This way.

362
00:28:38,574 --> 00:28:39,632
Show it.

363
00:28:50,386 --> 00:28:51,375
Let it be.

364
00:28:51,654 --> 00:28:53,053
Mrs. Bagchi.

365
00:29:06,602 --> 00:29:08,536
That wasn't Arnab.

366
00:29:12,809 --> 00:29:17,610
Mrs. Bagchi, doesn't Arnab
have any relatives in Kolkata.

367
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,978
Uncle or anyone?

368
00:29:23,719 --> 00:29:24,879
He has an uncle.

369
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:26,878
He stays in Thakurpukur.

370
00:29:46,309 --> 00:29:47,435
Here Here here (in tamil)

371
00:29:48,444 --> 00:29:49,433
Meaning?

372
00:29:50,379 --> 00:29:51,505
Arnab's school.

373
00:29:52,381 --> 00:29:54,042
Kalagachhia Kailash
Kamini High School.

374
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:55,344
I see.

375
00:29:55,451 --> 00:29:57,442
I have heard lot of stories about it.

376
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:01,648
Rana. That means uncle's
house must be close-by.

377
00:30:02,358 --> 00:30:04,326
Let's go that way.

378
00:30:19,909 --> 00:30:22,400
Rana. I should've worn a sari, right?

379
00:30:22,512 --> 00:30:23,501
Just hold this.

380
00:30:23,579 --> 00:30:25,513
Sari? You wear a sari as well.

381
00:30:25,548 --> 00:30:26,674
Do you have one?

382
00:30:28,651 --> 00:30:31,017
Don't worry, Mrs.
Bagchi. You are looking nice.

383
00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:32,443
Come.

384
00:30:32,688 --> 00:30:33,586
I am meeting them for the first time.

385
00:30:33,689 --> 00:30:34,485
I know..

386
00:30:35,758 --> 00:30:37,020
Arnab Bagchi.

387
00:30:37,393 --> 00:30:37,916
No.

388
00:30:38,027 --> 00:30:40,860
Then, does any other
Bagchi family live around here?

389
00:30:40,963 --> 00:30:43,659
Look, madam. We've been
living here for the past 30 years.

390
00:30:43,733 --> 00:30:46,031
But we never heard of
any Bagchi family..

391
00:30:46,102 --> 00:30:49,560
..or any Arnab Bagchi.

392
00:30:52,675 --> 00:30:53,607
Thank you.

393
00:30:53,709 --> 00:30:54,971
Who is Arnab Bagchi?

394
00:30:55,077 --> 00:30:55,839
Thank you.

395
00:30:59,916 --> 00:31:01,042
Can you come in, please?

396
00:31:10,593 --> 00:31:11,685
What happened? Been punished?

397
00:31:12,395 --> 00:31:13,020
What is this?

398
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:14,986
This is a flying swan.

399
00:31:15,064 --> 00:31:16,554
I see, that's a flying swan.

400
00:31:16,632 --> 00:31:17,326
Yes.

401
00:31:17,433 --> 00:31:18,593
It looks more like a dead duck to me.

402
00:31:19,435 --> 00:31:20,527
Okay, see you.

403
00:31:32,014 --> 00:31:36,075
No, dear. There was no
Arnab Bagchi that year.

404
00:31:36,719 --> 00:31:39,347
Why can't I access
Milan Damji's record?

405
00:31:39,488 --> 00:31:40,887
Its showing me Restricted each time.

406
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:43,356
Madam, I will need Mr.
Tyagi's permission to unlock it

407
00:31:43,926 --> 00:31:44,915
Where is Tyagi?

408
00:31:45,027 --> 00:31:45,959
He's on leave today.

409
00:32:18,327 --> 00:32:19,487
Coming, mother.

410
00:32:42,652 --> 00:32:43,380
Hello.

411
00:32:43,452 --> 00:32:44,043
Agnes.

412
00:32:44,353 --> 00:32:44,785
Yes.

413
00:32:44,887 --> 00:32:45,717
Hi.

414
00:32:45,821 --> 00:32:47,311
Can you meet me tomorrow?

415
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:48,386
Of course.

416
00:32:48,524 --> 00:32:49,456
At 3 o'clock.

417
00:32:49,558 --> 00:32:50,047
Where?

418
00:32:50,326 --> 00:32:51,953
There's a restaurant at Park Street.

419
00:32:52,061 --> 00:32:52,891
Mocambo.

420
00:32:52,995 --> 00:32:53,859
Mocambo.

421
00:32:54,697 --> 00:32:55,026
See you.

422
00:32:55,097 --> 00:32:55,563
Take care.

423
00:32:55,665 --> 00:32:56,529
Bye.

424
00:33:13,816 --> 00:33:14,680
Bishnu.

425
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:18,685
Bishnu!

426
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:19,914
Coming Didi..

427
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:27,455
Watch it.

428
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:28,554
Move aside.

429
00:33:33,002 --> 00:33:33,866
Here you go.

430
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:35,500
Radio?

431
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:41,071
Kalighat.

432
00:33:42,712 --> 00:33:43,701
Just a minute.

433
00:33:43,946 --> 00:33:46,813
Rana. Call from the airport.

434
00:33:48,384 --> 00:33:48,907
Hello.

435
00:33:48,984 --> 00:33:50,508
Better explain to that Bidya Bagchi.

436
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,482
Yes, yes, yes.

437
00:33:51,554 --> 00:33:53,419
That Arnab or whoever..

438
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:55,616
..got her pregnant and ran away.
These things keep happening.

439
00:33:55,691 --> 00:33:56,555
Hello?

440
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:59,753
Tell her not to waste time here in
this condition and return to London.

441
00:33:59,862 --> 00:34:00,954
Oh, so you checked?

442
00:34:01,931 --> 00:34:03,728
I have been thinking about
it for the past 30 years.

443
00:34:03,933 --> 00:34:05,423
But he ran away in 2.

444
00:34:07,303 --> 00:34:08,634
Sorry, can you say it again please.

445
00:34:09,372 --> 00:34:10,669
Would you like a cup of tea, sir?

446
00:34:11,307 --> 00:34:12,365
No, its fine. Thank you.

447
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:15,374
Hi.

448
00:34:19,014 --> 00:34:19,844
Mr. Das.

449
00:34:20,383 --> 00:34:21,042
Good morning, madam.

450
00:34:21,417 --> 00:34:22,509
Good afternoon, Mr. Das.

451
00:34:22,585 --> 00:34:23,017
Whatever you say, madam.

452
00:34:23,285 --> 00:34:23,979
Good afternoon, Rana.

453
00:34:24,053 --> 00:34:24,883
Good afternoon.

454
00:34:26,889 --> 00:34:27,981
Radio.

455
00:34:28,724 --> 00:34:29,691
Are you going anywhere?

456
00:34:29,759 --> 00:34:30,726
To meet Agnes.

457
00:34:31,293 --> 00:34:32,317
I will drop you there.

458
00:34:32,661 --> 00:34:34,686
I won't need your
chariot today, Satyoki.

459
00:34:34,764 --> 00:34:36,322
My taxi is waiting.

460
00:34:37,466 --> 00:34:38,296
Okay.

461
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,701
Mrs. Bagchi, we checked..

462
00:34:42,805 --> 00:34:44,830
..with Kolkata and
London's immigration departments.

463
00:34:45,908 --> 00:34:47,398
The date that you told us..

464
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:50,479
..no Arnab Bagchi left from London..

465
00:34:50,579 --> 00:34:52,570
..or arrived in Kolkata.

466
00:34:53,482 --> 00:34:55,416
Then surely there's a
mistake in the system.

467
00:34:56,018 --> 00:34:57,883
We double-checked it.
Triple-checked it.

468
00:34:58,487 --> 00:35:00,421
The facts are correct.

469
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:25,278
Yesterday after you left I
took a close look at the photo.

470
00:35:25,514 --> 00:35:26,640
And you know what.

471
00:35:26,715 --> 00:35:28,910
Your husband looks exactly like..

472
00:35:29,018 --> 00:35:31,486
..an ex-employee of ours.

473
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:32,484
Milan Damji.

474
00:35:32,788 --> 00:35:33,584
Who?

475
00:35:33,656 --> 00:35:34,714
Milan Damji.

476
00:35:34,824 --> 00:35:37,054
He left 2 years ago..

477
00:35:37,626 --> 00:35:38,888
He was a funny one.

478
00:35:38,961 --> 00:35:40,428
He would keep to himself.

479
00:35:40,529 --> 00:35:43,293
He joined suddenly
and even left suddenly.

480
00:35:43,866 --> 00:35:45,527
His blood group was funny as well.

481
00:35:45,668 --> 00:35:47,329
Bombay blood group.

482
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:50,767
I clearly remember the
day he left the company.

483
00:35:51,307 --> 00:35:53,537
A lot of people came looking for him.

484
00:35:54,076 --> 00:35:55,441
But he vanished!

485
00:35:55,544 --> 00:35:56,374
Poof.

486
00:35:56,479 --> 00:35:58,674
But what is the connection with Arnab?

487
00:35:59,081 --> 00:36:00,605
Two years ago he was in London.

488
00:36:00,649 --> 00:36:03,948
Milan Damji looks exactly like Arnab.

489
00:36:04,019 --> 00:36:06,419
That's why yesterday I tried..

490
00:36:06,489 --> 00:36:08,787
..to get his photo from the computer.

491
00:36:09,325 --> 00:36:11,259
But it would always
show me the same message..

492
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,021
..Restricted.
Restricted. Restricted.

493
00:36:13,295 --> 00:36:15,559
God knows how to
operate these computers!

494
00:36:15,764 --> 00:36:17,698
Tomorrow when Tyagi returns..

495
00:36:17,933 --> 00:36:18,695
Tyagi?

496
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:21,928
Tyagi here.

497
00:36:27,276 --> 00:36:28,868
Who wants Milan Damji's records?

498
00:36:29,345 --> 00:36:31,370
If I can't access the computer..

499
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:34,472
..there are some employee
records are in the old office.

500
00:36:34,850 --> 00:36:36,818
Maybe there's a photo in that.

501
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:41,521
Agnes, thank you but..

502
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:42,679
What will I do seeing Milan's photo?

503
00:36:42,791 --> 00:36:44,850
Just see Milan Damji's photo once.

504
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:46,325
Then decide.

505
00:37:00,309 --> 00:37:00,934
Bob.

506
00:37:05,347 --> 00:37:05,938
Bob.

507
00:37:06,882 --> 00:37:08,873
You can't do anything.

508
00:37:08,951 --> 00:37:10,384
The figures are so bad.

509
00:37:10,486 --> 00:37:12,784
You can't get a single
life insurance client.

510
00:37:12,888 --> 00:37:16,619
If this goes on then soon you
will be fired from this job.

511
00:37:18,394 --> 00:37:20,021
For God's sake, switch off the phone..

512
00:37:20,296 --> 00:37:21,695
..and concentrate on your target.

513
00:37:21,897 --> 00:37:22,795
Client, sir.

514
00:37:22,898 --> 00:37:23,865
Disgusting.

515
00:37:52,861 --> 00:37:53,793
Yes.

516
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:55,597
Hello.

517
00:37:56,298 --> 00:37:57,322
Hello.

518
00:37:57,399 --> 00:37:58,457
Agnes D'Mello.

519
00:37:58,601 --> 00:37:59,590
Yes.

520
00:37:59,735 --> 00:38:00,599
One minute

521
00:38:15,451 --> 00:38:17,419
Oh she wears a wig!

522
00:38:48,484 --> 00:38:49,712
Good morning, sir.

523
00:38:50,586 --> 00:38:51,814
Sir, he's in a meeting.

524
00:38:52,321 --> 00:38:55,484
Gentlemen, we've to
ensure that we do this.

525
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:01,561
Excuse me.

526
00:39:05,434 --> 00:39:09,234
I've to go to
Kolkata today, right now.

527
00:39:09,805 --> 00:39:10,601
Why?

528
00:39:10,706 --> 00:39:12,765
No smoking in the building, Khan.

529
00:39:12,975 --> 00:39:13,703
I know.

530
00:39:13,776 --> 00:39:15,903
Someone shot NDC's HR manager.

531
00:39:16,378 --> 00:39:17,310
So.

532
00:39:17,746 --> 00:39:19,714
That's the local
police station's case.

533
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:21,976
Why do you have to go
to Kolkata for that?

534
00:39:22,284 --> 00:39:24,275
She was trying to
access Milan's record.

535
00:39:28,357 --> 00:39:29,654
What other information do we have?

536
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:32,022
There's a pregnant lady,
from London.

537
00:39:32,594 --> 00:39:33,822
Vidya Bagchi.

538
00:39:37,566 --> 00:39:39,431
Listen, on the seventh day..

539
00:39:39,501 --> 00:39:41,025
I need this room empty for a while.

540
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:42,494
Everyone go out.

541
00:39:43,572 --> 00:39:44,561
What?

542
00:39:46,909 --> 00:39:47,898
Didn't you hear?

543
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:49,534
I need this room empty.

544
00:39:51,413 --> 00:39:52,641
Who are you?

545
00:39:53,782 --> 00:39:54,840
What is your name? Get out.

546
00:39:54,883 --> 00:39:56,851
Shut the.. Khan.

547
00:39:57,486 --> 00:39:59,954
That's my name Shut the.. Khan.

548
00:40:01,056 --> 00:40:02,318
Anything else?

549
00:40:02,558 --> 00:40:03,525
No, sir.

550
00:40:03,592 --> 00:40:04,524
Call Vidya Bagchi.

551
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,393
I want her here in 10 minutes.

552
00:40:06,929 --> 00:40:07,861
Okay, sir.

553
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,528
Tell me.

554
00:40:14,837 --> 00:40:16,600
I am pregnant woman, sir.

555
00:40:16,739 --> 00:40:18,934
You shouldn't be
smoking in front of me.

556
00:40:19,775 --> 00:40:22,767
Mrs. Bagchi, we don't
know much about each other.

557
00:40:22,878 --> 00:40:25,870
So leave it to me about
what I should or shouldn't do.

558
00:40:25,948 --> 00:40:28,416
Let's come to the point. Tell me.

559
00:40:28,984 --> 00:40:30,383
How are you related to Agnes?

560
00:40:31,687 --> 00:40:34,315
My husband Arnab Bagchi is missing.

561
00:40:37,626 --> 00:40:38,854
What happened? Why
is everyone outside?

562
00:40:38,894 --> 00:40:40,862
That Vidya Bagchi, it's a big problem.

563
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:41,419
Really?

564
00:40:41,497 --> 00:40:41,826
Yes.

565
00:40:41,897 --> 00:40:42,693
What are you saying?

566
00:40:45,534 --> 00:40:46,626
Mrs. Bagchi.

567
00:40:47,102 --> 00:40:48,433
What is going on?

568
00:40:48,704 --> 00:40:49,102
Look..

569
00:40:49,404 --> 00:40:49,995
Who are you?

570
00:40:50,105 --> 00:40:51,037
Look, I am talking to her.

571
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:51,704
Out.

572
00:40:51,774 --> 00:40:52,536
But who are you?

573
00:40:52,574 --> 00:40:52,972
Out.

574
00:40:58,380 --> 00:40:59,904
Close the door behind you.

575
00:41:01,416 --> 00:41:02,440
Out!

576
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,387
Yes, so what were you saying?

577
00:41:10,392 --> 00:41:11,484
Who is he?

578
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:14,993
Arnab's face resembles an
ex-employee Milan Damji.

579
00:41:15,597 --> 00:41:16,291
And Agnes..

580
00:41:16,398 --> 00:41:18,593
There was never an
employee called Milan there.

581
00:41:19,535 --> 00:41:21,867
I feel Agnes got it wrong

582
00:41:22,571 --> 00:41:23,697
Are you sure?

583
00:41:24,907 --> 00:41:26,670
Because I remember correctly..

584
00:41:26,775 --> 00:41:28,902
..that Agnes said Milan Damji.

585
00:41:29,678 --> 00:41:35,617
Mrs. Bagchi, I know more
about NDC than you and Agnes.

586
00:41:36,051 --> 00:41:38,519
2000 employees work there, understand.

587
00:41:41,323 --> 00:41:42,688
I am quite sure.

588
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:44,986
Yes, she also said that..

589
00:41:45,093 --> 00:41:48,756
..when she tried to
access Milan Damji's record..

590
00:41:48,864 --> 00:41:49,888
..she kept getting Restricted..

591
00:41:50,032 --> 00:41:50,999
You aren't listening to me.

592
00:41:51,099 --> 00:41:52,396
Are you listening?

593
00:41:56,471 --> 00:41:58,564
There was no one called Milan.

594
00:41:58,674 --> 00:42:01,837
No, inspector I am
sure Agnes said Milan.

595
00:42:01,944 --> 00:42:03,639
Do you understand what I am saying?

596
00:42:04,346 --> 00:42:05,973
There's no one called Milan there.

597
00:42:06,048 --> 00:42:07,811
You are still stuck on Milan.

598
00:42:07,883 --> 00:42:09,407
Don't you understand what I am saying?

599
00:42:09,585 --> 00:42:10,677
Milan. Milan. Milan.

600
00:42:10,986 --> 00:42:12,317
Out!

601
00:42:16,592 --> 00:42:18,423
Look, I..

602
00:42:20,295 --> 00:42:22,695
Mrs. Bagchi. Look here.

603
00:42:25,901 --> 00:42:28,392
I am giving you a free advice,
although I don't.

604
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:31,636
Get over with whatever you came
here to do and leave for London.

605
00:42:32,741 --> 00:42:34,675
That will be best for
you in this condition.

606
00:42:34,943 --> 00:42:36,035
Do you understand?

607
00:42:39,314 --> 00:42:40,372
Mr. Khan.

608
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:43,579
We don't know each other..

609
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:49,381
..so leave it to me about
what I should or shouldn't do.

610
00:42:50,926 --> 00:42:53,656
And anyway, you
don't give free advices..

611
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:55,489
That's good.

612
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:57,423
You shouldn't either.

613
00:42:57,933 --> 00:42:58,957
Quiet.

614
00:42:59,701 --> 00:43:00,668
Sir, sorry.

615
00:43:02,638 --> 00:43:03,935
Take all this inside.

616
00:43:05,641 --> 00:43:07,370
Mrs. Bagchi, I will drop you.

617
00:43:07,509 --> 00:43:08,498
Come.

618
00:43:09,311 --> 00:43:11,370
No, no, no. No need to worry, sir.

619
00:43:11,546 --> 00:43:12,706
It's a simple case.

620
00:43:13,348 --> 00:43:14,440
Actually.

621
00:43:17,319 --> 00:43:20,015
Agnes confused her husband with Milan.

622
00:43:22,991 --> 00:43:24,356
That Vidya Bagchi.

623
00:43:24,459 --> 00:43:26,689
Her husband got her
pregnant and disappeared.

624
00:43:27,496 --> 00:43:28,929
No, no, she is completely harmless.

625
00:43:30,766 --> 00:43:32,825
I will get her background checked.
Don't worry at all.

626
00:43:33,368 --> 00:43:36,337
Don't waste time on
that pregnant woman, Khan.

627
00:43:36,939 --> 00:43:38,634
Tell me about Milan.

628
00:43:46,348 --> 00:43:47,747
Give me Captain Bajpai.

629
00:43:51,753 --> 00:43:52,617
Yes.

630
00:43:52,688 --> 00:43:54,883
For God's sake get a mobile, Bajpai.

631
00:43:54,923 --> 00:43:56,686
Why? Why do I need a mobile?

632
00:43:57,025 --> 00:43:58,652
I stay at home the entire day.

633
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:00,919
When can you come to the office?

634
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:02,360
Why?

635
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:05,628
I needed to discuss
something important with you..

636
00:44:06,802 --> 00:44:08,326
..about Milan Damji.

637
00:44:09,972 --> 00:44:10,836
Hello?

638
00:44:12,607 --> 00:44:13,039
Bajpai?

639
00:44:13,475 --> 00:44:14,567
I'm here, go on.

640
00:44:15,277 --> 00:44:16,403
Can you come to the office?

641
00:44:17,913 --> 00:44:18,811
No.

642
00:44:34,363 --> 00:44:37,457
Rana. If I address
someone by his first name..

643
00:44:37,566 --> 00:44:38,794
..then what does it mean?

644
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:41,732
That you know him really well.

645
00:44:43,038 --> 00:44:44,767
There's no one called Milan there.

646
00:44:44,873 --> 00:44:46,340
Actually there is no Milan.

647
00:44:46,408 --> 00:44:47,432
Milan. Milan. Milan.

648
00:44:48,076 --> 00:44:49,907
According to Khan,
Milan Damji is someone..

649
00:44:50,012 --> 00:44:51,502
..who doesn't exist at all.

650
00:44:53,448 --> 00:44:55,609
Yet, he said Milan
instead of Milan Damji.

651
00:44:55,951 --> 00:44:56,849
Why?

652
00:44:58,754 --> 00:44:59,846
I am going to NDC.

653
00:45:00,322 --> 00:45:01,949
If I find out anything,
I will call you.

654
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:08,395
No, sir. There is no
Milan Damji in our records.

655
00:45:08,864 --> 00:45:11,560
How long have you been working here?

656
00:45:11,767 --> 00:45:13,029
Sir, 1 years.

657
00:45:13,635 --> 00:45:16,695
And you never heard
the name of Milan Damji?

658
00:45:16,772 --> 00:45:17,602
No, sir.

659
00:45:17,706 --> 00:45:18,502
Sapna, do you..

660
00:45:20,342 --> 00:45:20,933
You?

661
00:45:21,610 --> 00:45:24,670
Sir, he was inquiring about
Agnes D'mello's murder case.

662
00:45:25,847 --> 00:45:27,747
Do you have any authorization?

663
00:45:28,884 --> 00:45:29,908
I am standing right behind you?

664
00:45:30,619 --> 00:45:31,813
Whose name is Rana?

665
00:45:33,488 --> 00:45:35,683
Sir. I am Rana.

666
00:45:36,558 --> 00:45:37,525
Why did you go there?

667
00:45:37,626 --> 00:45:38,524
With whose permission?

668
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:40,794
Without any permission, or a warrant.

669
00:45:40,862 --> 00:45:42,625
To hell with the warrant,
first tell me..

670
00:45:42,898 --> 00:45:44,695
Why do you have to
conduct a local investigation..

671
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:45,926
..when this is an IB case?

672
00:45:47,402 --> 00:45:48,801
Next time if I see you following up..

673
00:45:48,904 --> 00:45:50,394
..without my permission.

674
00:45:50,872 --> 00:45:52,430
Then you will be
telling the traffic police..

675
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:54,065
..about the traffic from
the control room, understand.

676
00:45:54,743 --> 00:45:55,402
No, sir, actually..

677
00:45:55,510 --> 00:45:57,603
Did I ask you? Did I ask you?

678
00:45:58,780 --> 00:45:59,872
Will you work for the traffic control?

679
00:46:00,615 --> 00:46:01,775
Do you want to work
for the traffic control?

680
00:46:02,651 --> 00:46:03,345
Out.

681
00:46:04,352 --> 00:46:05,341
Who else?

682
00:46:05,654 --> 00:46:07,349
Do you? Out.

683
00:46:12,661 --> 00:46:13,719
What?

684
00:46:14,296 --> 00:46:15,558
Didn't you understand what I said?

685
00:46:15,730 --> 00:46:16,788
Out.

686
00:46:21,336 --> 00:46:22,530
How long have you
been doing service?

687
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:24,965
Six months, sir.

688
00:46:25,674 --> 00:46:26,766
Do you love your job?

689
00:46:28,310 --> 00:46:29,504
Do you want to keep working?

690
00:46:29,711 --> 00:46:30,803
Yes, sir.

691
00:46:42,991 --> 00:46:46,324
Mrs. Bagchi, I think
Khan sir is right.

692
00:46:46,661 --> 00:46:48,526
Agnes must be confused with someone.

693
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:51,395
See, NDC has at least 2000 employees..

694
00:46:51,466 --> 00:46:52,626
Exactly, Rana.

695
00:46:52,968 --> 00:46:54,833
2000 employees work in NDC..

696
00:46:54,936 --> 00:46:56,961
..so why did Agnes
take Milan Damji's name?

697
00:46:58,640 --> 00:46:59,732
She wasn't wrong?

698
00:46:59,774 --> 00:47:01,537
And you know, Agnes
never said anything..

699
00:47:01,643 --> 00:47:04,373
..until she hadn't seen
Arnab's photo properly.

700
00:47:13,522 --> 00:47:14,580
What happened?

701
00:47:14,656 --> 00:47:17,284
Why are those women
wearing such a sari?

702
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:18,348
Them?

703
00:47:18,426 --> 00:47:19,518
The red and white sari.

704
00:47:19,828 --> 00:47:21,921
They wear it on any auspicious day.

705
00:47:22,430 --> 00:47:23,522
But why?

706
00:47:24,733 --> 00:47:26,462
White sari with red border?

707
00:47:26,768 --> 00:47:27,894
Why should I wear that?

708
00:47:28,303 --> 00:47:28,997
Why? Why?

709
00:47:29,304 --> 00:47:30,293
It's traditional.

710
00:47:30,505 --> 00:47:31,870
Everyone wears that on
the last day of Durga Puja.

711
00:47:31,973 --> 00:47:33,338
Everyone, even men?

712
00:47:36,978 --> 00:47:39,538
I will get you one when I
go to Kolkata, Mrs. Bagchi.

713
00:47:39,748 --> 00:47:41,511
And trust me, even
you will look awesome.

714
00:47:42,784 --> 00:47:43,978
What?

715
00:47:48,690 --> 00:47:49,782
What?

716
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:54,585
Mr. Vidya Bagchi, don't bore me.

717
00:47:54,663 --> 00:47:57,757
And drop this stupid idea
of making me wear a sari.

718
00:47:58,967 --> 00:48:02,528
Just go to Kolkata
quietly and come back quickly.

719
00:48:07,309 --> 00:48:09,743
And then I forced
him to go to Kolkata.

720
00:48:13,014 --> 00:48:14,447
He's an idiot as well.

721
00:48:15,550 --> 00:48:16,539
He came here.

722
00:48:20,288 --> 00:48:22,449
He had this bad habit of
doing whatever I said.

723
00:48:35,637 --> 00:48:38,834
I am sure you will find Arnab.

724
00:48:45,447 --> 00:48:47,540
Can I say something,
if you don't mind?

725
00:48:48,016 --> 00:48:50,644
That sari, the one
that woman was wearing.

726
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:54,589
The day you find Arnab,
you can wear that sari.

727
00:48:55,523 --> 00:48:56,922
That will be the
auspicious day for you.

728
00:49:03,431 --> 00:49:05,296
Arnab won't be found so easily.

729
00:49:06,001 --> 00:49:07,628
I will have to look for him.

730
00:49:08,870 --> 00:49:10,462
That's the point, Mrs. Bagchi.

731
00:49:10,972 --> 00:49:11,996
How will we look for him?

732
00:49:13,541 --> 00:49:14,940
Milan Damji does not exist.

733
00:49:15,644 --> 00:49:17,839
He's some story that
you believe to be true.

734
00:49:20,915 --> 00:49:21,973
Rana.

735
00:49:22,717 --> 00:49:24,275
Agnes said..

736
00:49:24,486 --> 00:49:26,818
The employee records
are in the old office.

737
00:49:26,921 --> 00:49:29,014
There might be a photo in it.

738
00:49:31,326 --> 00:49:32,588
What are you saying?

739
00:49:33,662 --> 00:49:34,924
How can we barge
inside someone's office?

740
00:49:35,030 --> 00:49:36,691
That too, the National Data Centre.

741
00:49:36,798 --> 00:49:37,890
But it's closed down.

742
00:49:37,999 --> 00:49:38,727
Sapna.

743
00:49:38,833 --> 00:49:39,424
Yes, sir.

744
00:49:39,534 --> 00:49:41,695
Do you have hard copies of
the old employees records?

745
00:49:41,903 --> 00:49:43,837
No, sir. Everything's on the system.

746
00:49:43,938 --> 00:49:44,666
You sure?

747
00:49:44,773 --> 00:49:45,535
Yes, sir.

748
00:49:45,974 --> 00:49:46,838
Sir.

749
00:49:47,509 --> 00:49:49,500
There might be some in the old office.

750
00:49:49,611 --> 00:49:50,600
There's nothing here.

751
00:49:53,815 --> 00:49:54,474
Hello.

752
00:49:54,616 --> 00:49:55,583
Write down, third floor.

753
00:49:59,688 --> 00:50:01,383
Third floor.

754
00:50:01,623 --> 00:50:03,284
12 R.N. Mukherjee Road.

755
00:50:04,893 --> 00:50:06,656
It's the old NDC office.

756
00:50:07,362 --> 00:50:08,954
There's a file on Milan Damji..

757
00:50:09,064 --> 00:50:10,361
Who is Milan Damji?

758
00:50:10,899 --> 00:50:13,299
No one. Just do as I say.

759
00:50:13,368 --> 00:50:13,891
Get the file.

760
00:50:13,968 --> 00:50:14,866
Bob.

761
00:50:18,306 --> 00:50:18,931
Client.

762
00:50:20,608 --> 00:50:21,472
Good.

763
00:50:23,311 --> 00:50:24,369
Let's go.

764
00:50:35,724 --> 00:50:36,850
This one.

765
00:50:42,397 --> 00:50:44,331
Oh, God. That's a big lock.
I can't do it.

766
00:50:44,666 --> 00:50:46,031
Rana. Open it.

767
00:50:46,368 --> 00:50:47,460
How?

768
00:50:48,903 --> 00:50:50,803
Mrs. Bagchi, I am
the police not a thief.

769
00:50:50,905 --> 00:50:51,963
Really?

770
00:50:52,607 --> 00:50:53,767
Open it.

771
00:50:56,010 --> 00:50:56,999
This is great.

772
00:50:57,078 --> 00:51:00,445
The police is breaking and
entering himself. Very good.

773
00:51:32,447 --> 00:51:33,778
There are millions of files here.

774
00:51:33,882 --> 00:51:35,315
How will we find it?

775
00:51:39,854 --> 00:51:40,946
This is not done.

776
00:51:42,924 --> 00:51:44,653
We'll have to look
for the HR department.

777
00:51:44,759 --> 00:51:46,659
I am totally screwed
myself on this one (in Bengali)

778
00:51:46,761 --> 00:51:47,819
Meaning?

779
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:50,387
I will explain that later.

780
00:51:55,837 --> 00:51:56,769
What's written here?

781
00:51:56,838 --> 00:51:57,862
Same. Xerox.

782
00:52:06,881 --> 00:52:07,973
This door.

783
00:52:09,417 --> 00:52:12,284
Chief accounts. No, no, no.

784
00:52:14,856 --> 00:52:16,517
Rana. H.R.D.

785
00:52:37,979 --> 00:52:39,037
Look there.

786
00:52:41,416 --> 00:52:42,940
If it exists then it
must be somewhere here..

787
00:52:43,084 --> 00:52:44,016
..or it doesn't exist.

788
00:52:44,085 --> 00:52:46,019
If Agnes has said it,
then it must be here.

789
00:52:53,661 --> 00:52:55,686
DE. DH. DU.

790
00:52:55,797 --> 00:53:00,427
DS. DC. DDH.

791
00:53:00,535 --> 00:53:01,968
DA.

792
00:53:04,672 --> 00:53:06,572
Mrs. Bagchi, hurry up. Please.

793
00:53:06,641 --> 00:53:07,733
Just a minute, Rana.

794
00:53:11,613 --> 00:53:12,841
Milan Damji.

795
00:54:17,912 --> 00:54:20,278
There was no file on Milan Damji.

796
00:54:20,748 --> 00:54:22,272
Milan Damji exists.

797
00:54:22,383 --> 00:54:23,543
Who is Milan Damji?

798
00:54:28,489 --> 00:54:30,514
Where did you get this paper from?

799
00:54:30,925 --> 00:54:31,983
What difference does that make?

800
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:33,449
Who is Milan Damji?

801
00:54:33,528 --> 00:54:34,654
Is he your husband?

802
00:54:35,330 --> 00:54:36,422
Take a good look.

803
00:54:37,065 --> 00:54:38,362
Is he your husband?

804
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:39,792
Take a look.

805
00:54:39,867 --> 00:54:40,561
No.

806
00:54:40,668 --> 00:54:41,430
He isn't.

807
00:54:41,936 --> 00:54:44,461
Then what difference does
it make about who he is.

808
00:54:45,306 --> 00:54:46,603
Forget Milan Damji..

809
00:54:46,708 --> 00:54:48,539
..and I will forget where
you got this paper from.

810
00:54:48,643 --> 00:54:49,541
End of matter.

811
00:54:49,744 --> 00:54:51,644
Milan Damji isn't Arnab.

812
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:53,572
But he does look like Arnab..

813
00:54:53,681 --> 00:54:56,707
..and if something has
happened to my husband..

814
00:54:56,784 --> 00:54:58,911
..because of that, then it is
very important for me to know..

815
00:54:58,987 --> 00:55:00,420
..who Milan Damji is.

816
00:55:01,756 --> 00:55:05,624
Either you tell me
or you leave it to me.

817
00:55:06,794 --> 00:55:08,887
I will find the answer
and come back to you.

818
00:55:10,898 --> 00:55:12,365
How will you find out?

819
00:55:16,871 --> 00:55:18,930
I will go out and ask every person.

820
00:55:20,942 --> 00:55:23,775
Even if he's a common man
on the streets, the police.

821
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:26,969
Or the media?

822
00:55:29,417 --> 00:55:31,851
Someone will surely have
an answer to this question.

823
00:55:34,989 --> 00:55:36,354
Sit down, Mrs. Bagchi.

824
00:55:37,425 --> 00:55:38,483
Sit down.

825
00:55:45,533 --> 00:55:46,864
Do you know anything about..

826
00:55:46,934 --> 00:55:48,868
..the attack on
Kolkata Metro two years ago?

827
00:55:50,338 --> 00:55:50,997
Yes.

828
00:55:51,973 --> 00:55:53,941
Milan Damji was behind that attack.

829
00:55:54,776 --> 00:55:56,676
He's the prime suspect in this case.

830
00:55:59,814 --> 00:56:02,783
Then why doesn't anyone
know about Milan Damji.

831
00:56:02,850 --> 00:56:05,876
Milan Damji doesn't exist
for the world, that's why.

832
00:56:06,954 --> 00:56:08,387
He didn't exist for me either.

833
00:56:08,656 --> 00:56:11,386
Until the day I was
given the task to catch him.

834
00:56:11,893 --> 00:56:13,758
But until then it was too late.

835
00:56:14,462 --> 00:56:16,430
Milan disappeared and
so did all his reports.

836
00:56:16,597 --> 00:56:18,360
But how can anyone just disappear?

837
00:56:18,433 --> 00:56:19,695
It can be our agents.

838
00:56:20,435 --> 00:56:21,800
Milan was a government agent.

839
00:56:21,869 --> 00:56:23,359
He betrayed us. Joined
hands with the enemy.

840
00:56:23,771 --> 00:56:25,705
We have been hiding
this from the people.

841
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:28,600
Not just that, there's
someone in our system..

842
00:56:28,676 --> 00:56:29,973
..who is helping Milan.

843
00:56:31,379 --> 00:56:32,971
This is a dangerous game,
Mrs. Bagchi.

844
00:56:36,851 --> 00:56:39,479
Those who want to keep Milan
safe are very powerful people.

845
00:56:39,554 --> 00:56:40,851
They can do anything.

846
00:56:57,739 --> 00:56:58,865
Hello.

847
00:56:59,407 --> 00:57:00,396
Madam.

848
00:57:16,402 --> 00:57:18,870
Hello, madam.

849
00:57:19,938 --> 00:57:22,133
Madam. I am so sorry.

850
00:57:22,641 --> 00:57:24,268
It was a mistake.

851
00:57:24,810 --> 00:57:25,799
Are you alright?

852
00:57:26,078 --> 00:57:27,807
I saved you today.

853
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:29,006
My reflexes.

854
00:57:29,248 --> 00:57:30,340
What if I can't save you tomorrow?

855
00:57:30,649 --> 00:57:32,947
Oh, God. One
shouldn't think like that.

856
00:57:33,185 --> 00:57:35,915
You and your child should stay safe.

857
00:57:36,021 --> 00:57:37,682
I will pray to God for that.

858
00:57:37,923 --> 00:57:39,322
I will pray to God for that.

859
00:57:40,292 --> 00:57:41,224
Madam.

860
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:44,161
Madam. Kolkata, dangerous city.

861
00:57:44,229 --> 00:57:45,196
Right?

862
00:57:45,397 --> 00:57:48,127
Anything can happen here at anytime.

863
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:49,927
I am telling her for her own good.

864
00:57:50,035 --> 00:57:51,297
Go back.

865
00:57:51,370 --> 00:57:53,998
Go back, madam. Go back.

866
00:57:54,273 --> 00:57:57,140
Very dangerous city, Kolkata.

867
00:58:00,813 --> 00:58:01,745
No.

868
00:58:03,849 --> 00:58:05,043
I don't want to come back.

869
00:58:05,784 --> 00:58:07,911
You can have your bureau, your system.

870
00:58:08,921 --> 00:58:10,047
One project.

871
00:58:10,155 --> 00:58:11,884
Just one project failed.

872
00:58:11,957 --> 00:58:14,084
That doesn't mean we
shut down the bureau?

873
00:58:14,193 --> 00:58:15,023
Shut down the system..

874
00:58:15,094 --> 00:58:15,992
Just one project

875
00:58:17,696 --> 00:58:19,630
How easily you can
say that, Bhaskaran?

876
00:58:19,732 --> 00:58:20,664
Just one project.

877
00:58:20,733 --> 00:58:22,724
You gave me this assignment,
Bhaskaran.

878
00:58:23,836 --> 00:58:25,098
Pick three ordinary guys, train them..

879
00:58:25,170 --> 00:58:27,365
..and turn them into
bureau's best agents.

880
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:28,898
And what did I do?

881
00:58:29,007 --> 00:58:30,167
I created a monster.

882
00:58:31,910 --> 00:58:33,241
I found two good people..

883
00:58:33,312 --> 00:58:35,246
..but an animal like Milan
Damji got trained as well.

884
00:58:35,714 --> 00:58:38,911
And he joined hands with
those he had to save us from.

885
00:58:39,651 --> 00:58:44,645
He killed the very
civilians I trained him to protect.

886
00:58:45,124 --> 00:58:48,184
We will find Milan,
you just come back.

887
00:58:48,293 --> 00:58:51,285
You cannot find Milan,
Bhaskaran, that's the point.

888
00:58:51,363 --> 00:58:54,161
I trained him. You cannot find him.

889
00:58:54,733 --> 00:58:57,327
Only fools like you
and me can be found..

890
00:58:57,736 --> 00:59:01,672
..who keep ranting
Our system is perfect.

891
00:59:01,874 --> 00:59:03,102
Law has the upper hand.

892
00:59:03,342 --> 00:59:05,674
There is no
corruption in our system.

893
00:59:05,878 --> 00:59:07,243
Everything is hunky-dory.

894
00:59:08,981 --> 00:59:10,039
Bhaskaran.

895
00:59:11,717 --> 00:59:14,709
One man helped Milan Damji to escape.

896
00:59:15,721 --> 00:59:17,621
That man is still
working in your bureau..

897
00:59:17,689 --> 00:59:19,384
..right under your nose.

898
00:59:20,893 --> 00:59:24,829
The day you find him,
that day I will come back.

899
00:59:36,642 --> 00:59:38,735
Rana, three things are possible.

900
00:59:39,011 --> 00:59:39,773
One..

901
00:59:41,780 --> 00:59:43,407
Arnab has left me and ran away.

902
00:59:46,018 --> 00:59:46,985
Two..

903
00:59:48,153 --> 00:59:50,314
Arnab and Milan Damji
are the same person.

904
00:59:50,756 --> 00:59:51,780
And third..

905
00:59:51,957 --> 00:59:54,050
Arnab looks just like Milan Damji..

906
00:59:54,126 --> 00:59:56,321
..and that's why Arnab's in trouble.

907
00:59:57,062 --> 00:59:58,086
That must have happened.

908
00:59:59,298 --> 01:00:03,200
So you are saying that
Arnab looks like him and so..

909
01:00:03,302 --> 01:00:04,394
I am sure.

910
01:00:04,903 --> 01:00:06,928
We will have to find
Milan in order to find Arnab.

911
01:00:07,306 --> 01:00:10,673
And the day we find Milan,
we will find Arnab.

912
01:00:11,877 --> 01:00:13,845
Mrs. Bagchi, how is that possible?

913
01:00:13,946 --> 01:00:14,970
Where do we start
looking for someone..

914
01:00:15,047 --> 01:00:15,945
..we don't know anything about?

915
01:00:16,014 --> 01:00:16,912
From his house.

916
01:00:17,616 --> 01:00:18,139
Meaning?

917
01:00:18,250 --> 01:00:21,117
I mean Agnes's file had
Milan Damji's home address.

918
01:00:39,638 --> 01:00:40,730
How much further?

919
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:42,702
Ten minutes.

920
01:00:58,924 --> 01:01:00,016
Sorry.

921
01:01:10,335 --> 01:01:11,632
It must be somewhere around here?

922
01:01:12,671 --> 01:01:14,002
Which way is Bishambar Mallik Lane.

923
01:01:18,710 --> 01:01:20,803
Mrs. Bagchi, this is
Bishambar Mallik Lane.

924
01:01:21,179 --> 01:01:23,079
Didi, where is number 9.

925
01:01:23,382 --> 01:01:24,076
This one.

926
01:01:24,149 --> 01:01:24,638
This one?

927
01:01:24,683 --> 01:01:25,047
Yes.

928
01:01:25,117 --> 01:01:26,015
This is the one. Come.

929
01:01:30,656 --> 01:01:31,714
Number nine. Come on.

930
01:01:39,097 --> 01:01:40,086
You are ok to climb up?

931
01:01:40,365 --> 01:01:41,764
Yes. Let's go.

932
01:01:44,836 --> 01:01:45,768
Carefully.

933
01:01:46,638 --> 01:01:47,730
I don't know which one it is.

934
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:49,868
There are no numbers.

935
01:01:54,212 --> 01:01:55,270
Nothing's wrong.

936
01:01:55,914 --> 01:01:57,006
Where is number three?

937
01:01:57,115 --> 01:01:58,639
Over there but it's locked.
Anything wrong sir?

938
01:01:58,717 --> 01:01:59,684
Nothing, nothing.

939
01:02:00,652 --> 01:02:01,676
Come.

940
01:02:04,222 --> 01:02:05,211
Here it is.

941
01:02:05,791 --> 01:02:06,883
But it's locked.

942
01:02:08,293 --> 01:02:09,692
I see. Give.

943
01:02:13,765 --> 01:02:16,256
The police is breaking
and entering himself.

944
01:02:17,035 --> 01:02:18,059
You said so.

945
01:02:23,742 --> 01:02:24,731
Wait.

946
01:02:36,855 --> 01:02:39,688
I wonder why anyone
needed to lock this place.

947
01:02:39,925 --> 01:02:41,085
There's nothing here.

948
01:02:41,393 --> 01:02:42,883
And even if there was anything..

949
01:02:42,995 --> 01:02:44,826
..then Khan must
have taken it away .

950
01:02:45,897 --> 01:02:46,829
Mrs. Bagchi.

951
01:02:47,699 --> 01:02:48,393
Mrs. Bagchi.

952
01:02:48,667 --> 01:02:49,156
Yes.

953
01:02:49,267 --> 01:02:50,199
Let's go from here.

954
01:02:50,302 --> 01:02:51,291
There's nothing here.

955
01:02:52,304 --> 01:02:54,033
Yes, let me take a look.

956
01:03:02,147 --> 01:03:04,115
Mrs. Bagchi, don't do that.

957
01:03:04,216 --> 01:03:06,946
No, no, I am okay. I
will surely find something.

958
01:03:10,322 --> 01:03:11,653
Let's look there.

959
01:03:22,701 --> 01:03:25,966
Did you see, Rana, only flat
no.3 didn't have a letter-box?

960
01:03:31,276 --> 01:03:32,334
Who is it?

961
01:03:32,677 --> 01:03:34,941
Are there any letters for no.3?

962
01:03:35,347 --> 01:03:36,678
There is one.

963
01:03:54,866 --> 01:03:55,992
There in no.9.

964
01:03:56,868 --> 01:03:57,664
Just a minute.

965
01:03:57,736 --> 01:03:59,260
Poltu, come here.

966
01:03:59,838 --> 01:04:00,634
Where are you?

967
01:04:00,705 --> 01:04:02,832
Rana, Milan used to
order tea from here.

968
01:04:02,908 --> 01:04:04,068
Maybe they might know something.

969
01:04:04,276 --> 01:04:05,334
But how do you know?

970
01:04:06,278 --> 01:04:09,145
You offered me tea in a
similar glass in the police station.

971
01:04:10,348 --> 01:04:11,576
See what they are asking for.

972
01:04:11,650 --> 01:04:12,776
Remember, there were
two similar glasses..

973
01:04:12,818 --> 01:04:13,716
..at Milan's house.

974
01:04:13,785 --> 01:04:14,183
Yes.

975
01:04:14,252 --> 01:04:16,777
Now, there was no
kitchen in Milan's home, so..

976
01:04:16,955 --> 01:04:18,183
Didi Poltu.

977
01:04:18,657 --> 01:04:19,715
One minute.

978
01:04:21,259 --> 01:04:23,250
Are you scared?

979
01:04:23,862 --> 01:04:25,159
He is my friend.

980
01:04:25,897 --> 01:04:26,921
What is your name?

981
01:04:27,132 --> 01:04:27,894
Poltu.

982
01:04:27,966 --> 01:04:30,196
Poltu? Pet name or real name?

983
01:04:30,702 --> 01:04:32,966
Pet name. Real name is Subroto.

984
01:04:33,171 --> 01:04:35,639
Subroto, no need to be scared.

985
01:04:36,641 --> 01:04:38,632
So tell me, do you remember anything..

986
01:04:38,710 --> 01:04:39,802
..about the person in flat no.3?

987
01:04:40,212 --> 01:04:42,612
Flat no.3? No.

988
01:04:42,714 --> 01:04:43,681
Anything.

989
01:04:43,982 --> 01:04:45,006
I mean what kind of a person was he..

990
01:04:45,117 --> 01:04:46,175
Short-tempered?

991
01:04:46,251 --> 01:04:50,745
Or would he smile each
time you delivered tea?

992
01:04:51,223 --> 01:04:52,713
Would he say something?

993
01:04:52,991 --> 01:04:55,118
No, he wouldn't say anything, but..

994
01:04:55,861 --> 01:04:57,829
He would order only one glass of tea.

995
01:04:59,131 --> 01:05:02,828
And sometimes a second
person would come to meet him.

996
01:05:02,901 --> 01:05:04,061
That's when he would order two teas.

997
01:05:04,269 --> 01:05:05,395
Yes, there was someone.

998
01:05:05,637 --> 01:05:06,604
Who was the other person?

999
01:05:07,205 --> 01:05:09,070
He would always carry a suitcase.

1000
01:05:09,674 --> 01:05:11,198
And the corners looked like gold.

1001
01:05:11,877 --> 01:05:13,003
Suitcase?

1002
01:05:14,846 --> 01:05:15,938
This big.

1003
01:05:16,214 --> 01:05:17,272
Briefcase.

1004
01:05:18,350 --> 01:05:23,049
Oh, you look so handsome
when you smile, Subroto.

1005
01:05:24,089 --> 01:05:27,217
You can win any
child's heart so easily.

1006
01:05:28,026 --> 01:05:29,118
I am completely sure.

1007
01:05:29,227 --> 01:05:30,023
What?

1008
01:05:30,962 --> 01:05:32,293
That you will be a great mother.

1009
01:05:36,234 --> 01:05:38,600
Donation bills. Nonsense.

1010
01:05:39,104 --> 01:05:40,935
He said there's a
letter from the bank.

1011
01:05:41,339 --> 01:05:42,772
But this is a blood bank.

1012
01:05:43,008 --> 01:05:44,270
People's blood bank.

1013
01:05:46,811 --> 01:05:47,971
Bombay blood group?

1014
01:05:48,213 --> 01:05:52,206
Rana, Agnes had said that
Milan had a rare blood group.

1015
01:05:52,384 --> 01:05:53,851
Bombay blood group.

1016
01:05:54,686 --> 01:05:56,881
Sir, if any person
has a rare blood group..

1017
01:05:56,988 --> 01:05:59,115
..then he stores his blood with us.

1018
01:05:59,291 --> 01:06:00,986
So that if there's an emergency..

1019
01:06:01,059 --> 01:06:02,390
..then he can use his blood.

1020
01:06:02,694 --> 01:06:03,661
I see.

1021
01:06:04,629 --> 01:06:07,063
When was blood
required last in this case?

1022
01:06:07,165 --> 01:06:08,632
Will you check it and tell us?

1023
01:06:09,267 --> 01:06:10,700
Just a wait a minute, I will tell you.

1024
01:06:10,802 --> 01:06:11,666
Of course.

1025
01:06:15,807 --> 01:06:17,707
There was a requirement
for this rare blood group..

1026
01:06:17,809 --> 01:06:19,276
..on May 2008, 25th May.

1027
01:06:19,578 --> 01:06:21,842
And we received a call
from Ekbalpur Nursing Home.

1028
01:06:21,947 --> 01:06:23,278
Ekbalpur Nursing Home?

1029
01:06:29,955 --> 01:06:30,922
Not a single paper.

1030
01:06:31,590 --> 01:06:32,648
No records, nothing.

1031
01:06:33,158 --> 01:06:34,853
Must be. It's been erased.

1032
01:06:34,926 --> 01:06:36,257
Just like every
other records of Milan.

1033
01:06:37,929 --> 01:06:39,897
Mrs. Bagchi, this is a dead end.

1034
01:06:40,098 --> 01:06:41,360
Come on, Satyoki.

1035
01:06:41,900 --> 01:06:42,992
There must be something somewhere.

1036
01:06:43,068 --> 01:06:45,002
I am not going to accept defeat.
After making it so far.

1037
01:06:46,037 --> 01:06:47,629
You have always helped me.

1038
01:06:47,706 --> 01:06:50,197
I cannot go further
without your help, really.

1039
01:06:55,213 --> 01:06:57,340
There's a man who
may be able to help us.

1040
01:06:57,816 --> 01:06:59,340
He was once a police informer.

1041
01:07:16,167 --> 01:07:17,031
Sorry.

1042
01:07:20,071 --> 01:07:21,038
Come.

1043
01:07:28,647 --> 01:07:30,114
Careful. Careful.

1044
01:07:34,152 --> 01:07:35,176
Are you fine?

1045
01:07:38,156 --> 01:07:39,054
Thank you.

1046
01:07:50,402 --> 01:07:52,131
Sir, can you tell me
where is Paresh Pal..

1047
01:07:53,738 --> 01:07:54,170
Sir?

1048
01:07:54,839 --> 01:07:55,965
There. There.

1049
01:07:59,744 --> 01:08:00,403
Paresh.

1050
01:08:03,682 --> 01:08:05,946
No. I have no
connections with the police now.

1051
01:08:06,151 --> 01:08:09,120
But, Paresh, we just
need a small information.

1052
01:08:09,921 --> 01:08:12,151
Look, whether the
information is small or big.

1053
01:08:12,223 --> 01:08:13,247
I don't give it anymore.

1054
01:08:13,625 --> 01:08:15,923
Paresh Please.

1055
01:08:16,728 --> 01:08:18,025
Please leave.

1056
01:08:18,196 --> 01:08:20,164
If someone sees us then
it will create a problem.

1057
01:08:22,667 --> 01:08:23,759
Sir..

1058
01:08:24,836 --> 01:08:26,269
I am searching for my husband.

1059
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:30,631
I came from London in
this condition all alone.

1060
01:08:31,176 --> 01:08:34,668
I just need an answer for my child..

1061
01:08:34,946 --> 01:08:36,743
..that what happened to his father.

1062
01:08:38,383 --> 01:08:39,975
I cannot force you,

1063
01:08:42,187 --> 01:08:44,348
but.. please help us.

1064
01:08:48,259 --> 01:08:49,191
Tell.

1065
01:08:49,227 --> 01:08:50,785
Have you heard about Milan Damji?

1066
01:08:52,397 --> 01:08:53,364
Who?

1067
01:08:53,765 --> 01:08:54,891
Milan Damji.

1068
01:08:54,966 --> 01:08:56,991
Milan Damji. No.

1069
01:08:57,135 --> 01:08:59,160
Two years ago, on 25th May..

1070
01:09:00,071 --> 01:09:02,699
..Bombay blood group was
required in Ekbalpur Nursing Home.

1071
01:09:03,208 --> 01:09:04,106
What for?

1072
01:09:04,376 --> 01:09:05,365
We just need to find that out.

1073
01:09:05,877 --> 01:09:06,809
Can you do that?

1074
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:17,046
Laundry Didi?

1075
01:09:21,726 --> 01:09:22,693
Laundry Didi?

1076
01:09:22,761 --> 01:09:25,025
I am not Laundry Didi,
I am Bidya Didi.

1077
01:09:28,867 --> 01:09:30,835
Your transistor is giving chocolate.

1078
01:09:31,369 --> 01:09:32,734
Such a big chocolate.

1079
01:09:32,837 --> 01:09:33,769
So big.

1080
01:09:34,672 --> 01:09:35,400
Hello.

1081
01:09:35,974 --> 01:09:38,101
You did disturb me, I am
in a important meeting.

1082
01:09:39,644 --> 01:09:41,009
In the room with Vishnu.

1083
01:09:42,981 --> 01:09:44,005
Really?

1084
01:09:44,883 --> 01:09:45,907
When?

1085
01:09:52,824 --> 01:09:55,088
25th May, 2008.

1086
01:09:55,727 --> 01:09:57,820
Two men had a meeting here.

1087
01:09:58,329 --> 01:10:01,696
There was news about only
two people meeting until now.

1088
01:10:05,069 --> 01:10:08,061
But now it appears there was a
third person present as well.

1089
01:10:08,673 --> 01:10:12,609
And the blood was ordered
from Ekbalpur Nursing Home..

1090
01:10:12,811 --> 01:10:14,039
..for this third person.

1091
01:10:14,145 --> 01:10:16,204
So, was that third person Milan Damji?

1092
01:10:16,247 --> 01:10:18,181
I don't have anymore information.

1093
01:10:18,316 --> 01:10:20,045
Paresh..

1094
01:10:20,084 --> 01:10:21,142
Wait.

1095
01:10:21,719 --> 01:10:24,813
You will find the rest
of the information..

1096
01:10:24,889 --> 01:10:26,754
..at Park Street Police
Station or you can find Dr. Ganguly.

1097
01:10:26,958 --> 01:10:29,290
That night he was on night duty.

1098
01:10:35,834 --> 01:10:37,734
I remember that it was a police case..

1099
01:10:37,869 --> 01:10:40,303
..but I don't remember
what exactly it was.

1100
01:10:41,005 --> 01:10:41,664
It was two years ago.

1101
01:10:41,739 --> 01:10:42,137
Ready, sir.

1102
01:10:42,207 --> 01:10:42,901
Yes, I will be there.

1103
01:10:43,007 --> 01:10:43,701
Okay.

1104
01:10:44,108 --> 01:10:46,167
Give me a day, I
will check and tell you.

1105
01:10:46,244 --> 01:10:46,767
Thank you.

1106
01:10:46,911 --> 01:10:47,843
I need to go, I have a surgery.

1107
01:10:47,912 --> 01:10:48,378
Thank you.

1108
01:11:00,225 --> 01:11:01,157
Don't worry.

1109
01:11:01,226 --> 01:11:01,988
Please.

1110
01:11:02,093 --> 01:11:03,025
Thank you very much.

1111
01:11:17,709 --> 01:11:18,232
Yes.

1112
01:11:19,177 --> 01:11:20,109
Dr. Ganguly?

1113
01:11:20,178 --> 01:11:21,076
Yes.

1114
01:11:21,145 --> 01:11:23,375
Hello. Bob Biswas.

1115
01:11:23,715 --> 01:11:24,647
Hello.

1116
01:11:24,716 --> 01:11:25,648
Just a minute.

1117
01:11:31,356 --> 01:11:34,120
I remember that it
was a police case.

1118
01:11:35,860 --> 01:11:37,157
Stop it Rana.

1119
01:11:37,228 --> 01:11:40,686
Your computer is driving
me up the bloody wall.

1120
01:11:40,765 --> 01:11:41,925
Mr. Chatterjee.

1121
01:11:42,033 --> 01:11:42,658
What?

1122
01:11:42,734 --> 01:11:43,223
Hello.

1123
01:11:43,301 --> 01:11:44,393
Oh my, God.

1124
01:11:44,669 --> 01:11:45,636
Bidya Bagchi.

1125
01:11:45,703 --> 01:11:46,761
You arrived at the right time.

1126
01:11:46,871 --> 01:11:47,633
Hi, Rana.

1127
01:11:47,705 --> 01:11:49,639
You had shut this computer
up the other day, didn't you?

1128
01:11:49,707 --> 01:11:49,968
Yes.

1129
01:11:50,074 --> 01:11:51,006
Do it today as well, please.

1130
01:11:51,075 --> 01:11:52,042
Otherwise I will go crazy.

1131
01:11:52,644 --> 01:11:53,269
Thank you.

1132
01:11:53,678 --> 01:11:55,339
I will go meet the senior officer.

1133
01:11:56,781 --> 01:11:57,338
Come, come.

1134
01:11:57,415 --> 01:11:58,279
Oh, God.

1135
01:11:58,883 --> 01:11:59,941
No, no, keep seated.

1136
01:12:00,051 --> 01:12:00,949
He can return any moment.

1137
01:12:04,689 --> 01:12:06,657
Two people were killed
at Nonakpur Tram Depot..

1138
01:12:06,724 --> 01:12:07,713
..on the 25th of May.

1139
01:12:08,026 --> 01:12:09,254
One was Dinesh Rao..

1140
01:12:09,661 --> 01:12:12,892
..who was a police
informer in the Metro attack case.

1141
01:12:12,964 --> 01:12:13,931
And second..

1142
01:12:16,601 --> 01:12:19,968
Second was Vijay Verma
who was a government agent.

1143
01:12:20,071 --> 01:12:21,060
Government agent?

1144
01:12:24,809 --> 01:12:25,867
He's back, he's back.

1145
01:12:28,913 --> 01:12:29,937
It's done, sir.

1146
01:12:29,981 --> 01:12:31,312
Done, Mr. Chatterjee.

1147
01:12:31,683 --> 01:12:32,308
It's done.

1148
01:12:32,617 --> 01:12:34,209
That's nice, very good.

1149
01:12:34,319 --> 01:12:35,684
Thank you, thank you. Thank you.

1150
01:12:35,753 --> 01:12:36,617
Welcome.

1151
01:12:36,688 --> 01:12:37,382
Okay.

1152
01:12:39,324 --> 01:12:40,313
What is the matter?

1153
01:12:40,391 --> 01:12:43,053
Mr. Chatterjee, may I leave?

1154
01:12:43,661 --> 01:12:44,650
Yes.

1155
01:12:44,729 --> 01:12:45,195
Bye.

1156
01:12:45,296 --> 01:12:46,729
Bye.

1157
01:13:24,268 --> 01:13:25,326
Yes, mother.

1158
01:13:26,270 --> 01:13:27,328
I am coming.

1159
01:13:56,401 --> 01:13:57,891
Mrs. Bagchi, what are you doing?

1160
01:13:57,969 --> 01:13:59,129
Why are you cleaning it yourself?

1161
01:13:59,237 --> 01:14:00,329
Wait, I will call the staff?

1162
01:14:00,638 --> 01:14:00,967
No. no, no, no.

1163
01:14:01,072 --> 01:14:01,834
Come here.

1164
01:14:01,873 --> 01:14:03,238
I do the cleaning myself at home.

1165
01:14:03,641 --> 01:14:06,132
Sit. I cannot tolerate dust.

1166
01:14:06,577 --> 01:14:07,339
Pull a chair.

1167
01:14:07,779 --> 01:14:09,269
Speak, Satyoki Sinha.

1168
01:14:10,648 --> 01:14:12,206
Mrs. Bagchi, I
pursued the information..

1169
01:14:12,316 --> 01:14:13,613
..acquired from the database.

1170
01:14:13,785 --> 01:14:16,117
There is no mention of a
third person in the records.

1171
01:14:16,187 --> 01:14:19,179
Dr. Ganguly, Milan Damji,
Ekbalpur Nursing Home.

1172
01:14:19,691 --> 01:14:21,352
No one knows anything about them.

1173
01:14:21,793 --> 01:14:24,091
There are only
records of Vijay and Dinesh.

1174
01:14:24,962 --> 01:14:26,896
Vijay Verma was
investigating the Metro attack..

1175
01:14:26,964 --> 01:14:28,090
..at ground level.

1176
01:14:28,332 --> 01:14:29,196
Really?

1177
01:14:29,300 --> 01:14:33,327
That's why he met Dinesh
Raut at Nonakpur Tram Depot.

1178
01:14:35,306 --> 01:14:37,831
Maybe Dinesh wanted to tell Vijay..

1179
01:14:37,909 --> 01:14:39,638
..something about Milan.

1180
01:14:40,344 --> 01:14:43,313
And someone informed Milan about it.

1181
01:14:43,915 --> 01:14:48,011
Milan killed both of them and
got injured in the shootout.

1182
01:14:49,087 --> 01:14:51,851
But the question is
that how did Milan know..

1183
01:14:51,956 --> 01:14:53,981
..that Vijay is going to
receive information about him?

1184
01:14:54,826 --> 01:14:56,088
Maybe Khan was right.

1185
01:14:56,961 --> 01:14:58,895
There is someone within the system..

1186
01:14:58,996 --> 01:15:00,020
..who is helping Milan.

1187
01:15:00,131 --> 01:15:01,120
One more thing.

1188
01:15:01,666 --> 01:15:02,894
NDC is also involved in this.

1189
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:03,659
Really?

1190
01:15:03,835 --> 01:15:06,804
Mrs. Bagchi, every agent
has a local, a fake identity.

1191
01:15:06,971 --> 01:15:08,165
Just like Milan Damji..

1192
01:15:08,239 --> 01:15:10,605
..even Vijay Verma worked for NDC.

1193
01:15:11,109 --> 01:15:12,576
To hide his true identity.

1194
01:15:17,348 --> 01:15:18,975
It must be him, take a good look.

1195
01:15:20,218 --> 01:15:22,277
No. it wasn't him.

1196
01:15:22,787 --> 01:15:24,186
Now, now, take a look.

1197
01:15:24,255 --> 01:15:25,813
No, Didi. That wasn't him.

1198
01:15:27,058 --> 01:15:27,752
It's not him.

1199
01:15:27,825 --> 01:15:28,314
Are you sure?

1200
01:15:28,593 --> 01:15:29,150
Sure.

1201
01:15:30,628 --> 01:15:31,925
Come, let's take Poltu back.

1202
01:15:32,096 --> 01:15:34,189
I was absolutely sure that..

1203
01:15:34,599 --> 01:15:37,363
Tyagi knew that Agnes is
looking for Milan's details.

1204
01:15:37,735 --> 01:15:38,724
And Tyagi stopped you.

1205
01:15:38,836 --> 01:15:39,302
Of course.

1206
01:15:39,337 --> 01:15:40,031
Didi.

1207
01:15:40,104 --> 01:15:40,729
What?

1208
01:15:41,038 --> 01:15:41,800
The suitcase.

1209
01:15:49,213 --> 01:15:50,111
It was him, Didi.

1210
01:15:52,383 --> 01:15:53,042
Are you sure?

1211
01:15:53,117 --> 01:15:54,015
Sure, it was him.

1212
01:15:56,120 --> 01:15:56,950
Who was he?

1213
01:15:57,221 --> 01:15:58,119
I don't know.

1214
01:15:58,189 --> 01:16:00,623
You take Poltu home..

1215
01:16:00,691 --> 01:16:01,885
..I will find out and meet you there.

1216
01:16:01,926 --> 01:16:02,858
Yes.

1217
01:16:03,928 --> 01:16:04,952
Good morning, sir.

1218
01:16:05,963 --> 01:16:07,123
Good morning, sir.

1219
01:16:08,866 --> 01:16:09,855
Good morning.

1220
01:16:38,863 --> 01:16:39,830
Turn around.

1221
01:16:39,897 --> 01:16:40,921
Turn around.

1222
01:17:01,385 --> 01:17:01,908
Didi?

1223
01:17:02,019 --> 01:17:02,348
Yes.

1224
01:17:02,653 --> 01:17:04,280
Will you have tea?

1225
01:17:04,322 --> 01:17:05,050
No.

1226
01:17:05,656 --> 01:17:09,023
Listen, when Rana arrives
will you ask him to call me.

1227
01:17:09,093 --> 01:17:09,752
The police officer?

1228
01:17:09,861 --> 01:17:10,225
Yes.

1229
01:17:10,294 --> 01:17:10,851
Okay.

1230
01:17:10,962 --> 01:17:11,656
Yes, fine.

1231
01:17:12,096 --> 01:17:12,858
Bye.

1232
01:17:44,896 --> 01:17:45,658
Sorry.

1233
01:17:45,763 --> 01:17:46,354
Rana.

1234
01:17:46,964 --> 01:17:49,091
I was waiting for you at
the tea-stall for so long..

1235
01:17:49,166 --> 01:17:49,928
Blood!

1236
01:17:50,201 --> 01:17:51,099
Oh no.

1237
01:17:56,941 --> 01:17:59,671
Rana, that's him. He tried to kill me.

1238
01:18:00,211 --> 01:18:01,371
Stop. I am the police.

1239
01:18:25,970 --> 01:18:27,028
Stop. Stop.

1240
01:18:29,106 --> 01:18:29,970
Stop.

1241
01:18:55,900 --> 01:18:57,731
Move.

1242
01:19:18,856 --> 01:19:19,254
Stop.

1243
01:19:19,323 --> 01:19:20,221
Stop.

1244
01:19:21,058 --> 01:19:21,854
Stop.

1245
01:19:41,045 --> 01:19:42,012
Oh, God.

1246
01:19:42,146 --> 01:19:44,842
Mrs. Bagchi, Bob Biswas
was a contract killer.

1247
01:19:44,915 --> 01:19:45,882
This is his phone.

1248
01:19:45,950 --> 01:19:47,941
And I have found these
photographs in his phone.

1249
01:19:48,652 --> 01:19:49,641
Agnes D'mello.

1250
01:19:50,755 --> 01:19:51,744
Dr. Ganguly.

1251
01:19:53,024 --> 01:19:54,184
And you.

1252
01:19:54,258 --> 01:19:55,190
This time you survived.

1253
01:19:55,259 --> 01:19:57,022
But the man who hired Bob..

1254
01:19:57,128 --> 01:19:59,153
..who doesn't want
anyone to reach Milan Damji..

1255
01:19:59,263 --> 01:20:01,128
I gave this photo to Agnes.

1256
01:20:01,866 --> 01:20:02,958
Just a minute.

1257
01:20:08,873 --> 01:20:09,737
Look.

1258
01:20:10,875 --> 01:20:13,105
I gave a copy of this photo to Agnes.

1259
01:20:13,844 --> 01:20:16,312
That means whoever gave
Bob the contract is in NDC.

1260
01:20:16,614 --> 01:20:20,311
No, no. It means you didn't
hear anything I said until now.

1261
01:20:20,684 --> 01:20:22,242
And you don't understand, Mrs. Bagchi.

1262
01:20:22,319 --> 01:20:23,718
Your life is in danger.

1263
01:20:23,821 --> 01:20:24,879
And I will have to
tell Mr. Khan about this.

1264
01:20:24,989 --> 01:20:26,217
Did you find out who Mr.
Briefcase was?

1265
01:20:26,290 --> 01:20:26,722
Mrs. Bagchi..

1266
01:20:26,857 --> 01:20:27,687
Who was he?

1267
01:20:28,659 --> 01:20:29,683
He is Shridhar.

1268
01:20:29,960 --> 01:20:31,086
The head of IT department.

1269
01:20:31,162 --> 01:20:32,322
Tyagi reports to him.

1270
01:20:38,002 --> 01:20:41,062
Rana, we thought that
Tyagi is doing everything.

1271
01:20:41,739 --> 01:20:44,299
But Tyagi was only
passing the information.

1272
01:20:44,375 --> 01:20:46,138
We have no such evidence.

1273
01:20:46,944 --> 01:20:48,002
Come, let's go to the police.

1274
01:20:48,079 --> 01:20:49,671
And yes, that phone is a evidence.

1275
01:20:49,780 --> 01:20:50,371
Please give it back.

1276
01:20:50,881 --> 01:20:51,677
Phone.

1277
01:20:52,983 --> 01:20:54,780
Rana look.

1278
01:20:54,885 --> 01:20:57,183
Bob has been sent this
message from some website.

1279
01:20:57,388 --> 01:20:58,377
So?

1280
01:20:59,356 --> 01:21:01,824
Once I hack this
website then I will know..

1281
01:21:01,926 --> 01:21:03,393
..whose computer these
photos were sent from.

1282
01:21:03,694 --> 01:21:04,319
What, you..?

1283
01:21:08,332 --> 01:21:09,663
You are a hacker?

1284
01:21:09,733 --> 01:21:10,893
Only in my spare time.

1285
01:21:11,802 --> 01:21:13,360
You do know that I am
the police, don't you?

1286
01:21:20,644 --> 01:21:22,202
Yes, yes, yes.

1287
01:21:23,314 --> 01:21:24,246
Sorry.

1288
01:21:26,650 --> 01:21:28,709
This is the IP
address of the computer..

1289
01:21:28,819 --> 01:21:30,650
..from where the
photos the photos were sent.

1290
01:21:30,921 --> 01:21:32,684
And I am completely sure..

1291
01:21:32,823 --> 01:21:34,620
..this is the IP address
of that Mr. Briefcase.

1292
01:21:34,692 --> 01:21:35,852
And once that is confirmed..

1293
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:37,325
..then we can find Milan Damji.

1294
01:21:37,394 --> 01:21:38,827
No, no, no. Mrs. Bagchi. Mrs. Bagchi.

1295
01:21:38,896 --> 01:21:40,386
This matter is very serious now.

1296
01:21:40,698 --> 01:21:42,325
And I still say that we
should go to the police.

1297
01:21:42,399 --> 01:21:43,991
We don't have time, Rana.

1298
01:21:44,668 --> 01:21:47,398
Mr. Briefcase will soon
find out that Bob is dead..

1299
01:21:47,671 --> 01:21:49,639
..and then he will try
to erase all the records.

1300
01:21:49,707 --> 01:21:50,639
No, Mrs. Bagchi, I..

1301
01:21:50,708 --> 01:21:51,174
Please.

1302
01:21:51,275 --> 01:21:53,300
We just have to access
Shridhar's computer.

1303
01:21:53,377 --> 01:21:55,311
After that we will go to the police.

1304
01:21:55,846 --> 01:21:57,370
Cross my heart and hope to die.

1305
01:22:00,784 --> 01:22:02,217
You think death is a joke, Vidya?

1306
01:22:05,189 --> 01:22:07,282
Mrs. Bagchi, I have
told you so many times..

1307
01:22:08,092 --> 01:22:09,354
..that your life is in danger.

1308
01:22:11,629 --> 01:22:13,654
You even witnessed
everything with your own eyes.

1309
01:22:14,365 --> 01:22:16,663
Even after that you
are joking about death.

1310
01:22:20,771 --> 01:22:23,137
Maybe because, after Arnab..

1311
01:22:24,275 --> 01:22:26,675
..life has become a joke, Rana.

1312
01:22:28,979 --> 01:22:30,003
Shall we?

1313
01:22:44,261 --> 01:22:45,159
Sapna.

1314
01:22:45,863 --> 01:22:46,659
Yes, sir.

1315
01:22:46,897 --> 01:22:48,330
You haven't left yet, Sapna.

1316
01:22:48,832 --> 01:22:51,198
Sir, the office is going to
shout for the Puja from tomorrow.

1317
01:22:51,235 --> 01:22:52,827
So I was completing my work.

1318
01:22:54,872 --> 01:22:57,636
It is very good to see
someone working so hard.

1319
01:22:58,375 --> 01:23:03,005
One day, when I get the
time I will take you out.

1320
01:23:03,414 --> 01:23:04,381
For coffee.

1321
01:23:04,748 --> 01:23:05,908
I would love that, sir.

1322
01:23:06,116 --> 01:23:07,105
Bye.

1323
01:23:09,753 --> 01:23:10,879
Good evening sir.

1324
01:23:14,024 --> 01:23:15,685
I am coming, darling.

1325
01:23:18,662 --> 01:23:19,287
Good evening, sir.

1326
01:23:19,363 --> 01:23:20,261
Good evening.

1327
01:23:21,065 --> 01:23:22,657
This is the visitor's entry book

1328
01:23:22,733 --> 01:23:24,098
Get the employer's book.

1329
01:23:24,168 --> 01:23:24,964
Sorry, sir.

1330
01:23:31,041 --> 01:23:31,803
Thank you.

1331
01:23:32,142 --> 01:23:33,006
Come.

1332
01:23:47,324 --> 01:23:48,621
It's not opening.

1333
01:23:56,734 --> 01:23:57,359
Thank you.

1334
01:23:57,401 --> 01:23:58,299
Thanks.

1335
01:23:58,369 --> 01:23:59,199
Rana please hurry.

1336
01:24:02,339 --> 01:24:04,204
Mrs. Bagchi, quickly do
whatever you want to do.

1337
01:24:40,244 --> 01:24:41,973
Bob.. Come on Bob,
pick up the phone.

1338
01:24:42,079 --> 01:24:43,205
Bob Bob.

1339
01:24:45,983 --> 01:24:47,041
Mrs. Bagchi, hurry up please.

1340
01:24:47,117 --> 01:24:48,311
Rana, just a minute.

1341
01:24:48,385 --> 01:24:49,613
I am almost there.

1342
01:25:01,932 --> 01:25:04,196
Mrs. Bagchi, what is happening?

1343
01:25:05,669 --> 01:25:07,933
Sapna was right, there are
many layers of protection.

1344
01:25:08,038 --> 01:25:09,164
It will take a little time.

1345
01:25:14,244 --> 01:25:18,578
Mrs. Bagchi, why is it taking
you so long to check an IP address?

1346
01:25:20,284 --> 01:25:22,718
Rana. Rana. IP address.

1347
01:25:22,820 --> 01:25:23,946
It's the same IP address.

1348
01:25:24,021 --> 01:25:26,251
Mr. Briefcase. We've nailed him.
- Are you sure?

1349
01:25:26,690 --> 01:25:28,123
Of course.

1350
01:25:28,926 --> 01:25:30,188
Guard! Guard!

1351
01:25:30,260 --> 01:25:31,727
Why are you sleeping? Get up.

1352
01:25:31,829 --> 01:25:32,261
Yes.

1353
01:25:32,329 --> 01:25:33,626
Was someone here with Sapna madam?

1354
01:25:33,697 --> 01:25:35,892
A man and a woman.

1355
01:25:36,300 --> 01:25:38,291
Oh no. Close all doors.

1356
01:25:38,736 --> 01:25:40,033
Don't let anyone go out.

1357
01:25:40,137 --> 01:25:40,899
Yes, sir.

1358
01:25:52,716 --> 01:25:54,240
Did anyone come down?

1359
01:25:54,651 --> 01:25:55,310
No, sir.

1360
01:25:58,288 --> 01:25:59,949
Where did they go? Where can they..

1361
01:26:00,924 --> 01:26:01,322
Hey

1362
01:26:02,025 --> 01:26:05,085
The back entrance, where
people go to smoke is it open?

1363
01:26:05,195 --> 01:26:05,889
Yes, sir.

1364
01:26:11,835 --> 01:26:12,893
Come.

1365
01:26:12,970 --> 01:26:14,130
We came out at the right time.

1366
01:26:53,877 --> 01:26:54,809
Oh no.

1367
01:26:55,145 --> 01:26:57,340
Mrs. Bagchi, come quickly.

1368
01:27:02,152 --> 01:27:03,119
Hello.

1369
01:27:03,287 --> 01:27:04,914
Sir we came out from the back
entrance.. Shridhar is following us.

1370
01:27:04,955 --> 01:27:06,286
What happened? Who are you calling?

1371
01:27:06,657 --> 01:27:07,715
Yes.

1372
01:27:08,091 --> 01:27:09,319
Please come quickly, sir.
We need help.

1373
01:27:09,960 --> 01:27:10,984
What happened?

1374
01:27:11,195 --> 01:27:12,389
I had to call Khan sir.

1375
01:27:12,663 --> 01:27:13,630
Khan?

1376
01:27:13,831 --> 01:27:15,128
Sorry. Shridhar is right behind us.

1377
01:27:15,232 --> 01:27:16,221
Maybe he knows.

1378
01:27:25,042 --> 01:27:26,031
Come.

1379
01:27:29,079 --> 01:27:30,944
What did you take from my computer?

1380
01:27:42,793 --> 01:27:43,885
Gun.

1381
01:27:44,027 --> 01:27:45,221
Where is my gun?

1382
01:27:56,740 --> 01:27:57,263
Come.

1383
01:27:57,341 --> 01:27:58,433
Let's go, Mrs. Bagchi.

1384
01:27:59,142 --> 01:28:00,302
Rana, bag.

1385
01:28:03,113 --> 01:28:03,738
Stop it.

1386
01:28:03,881 --> 01:28:05,178
Don't shoot. Don't shoot.

1387
01:28:05,249 --> 01:28:06,739
We want this man alive.

1388
01:28:15,092 --> 01:28:17,822
No, no, no. this man can't die.

1389
01:28:19,029 --> 01:28:19,996
Oh no.

1390
01:28:20,063 --> 01:28:21,826
We wanted this man alive.

1391
01:28:22,833 --> 01:28:23,993
Why didn't you call me earlier?

1392
01:28:24,401 --> 01:28:26,062
How will we catch Milan now?

1393
01:28:31,074 --> 01:28:33,099
How will we catch Milan without him?

1394
01:28:35,746 --> 01:28:36,804
Take him to the hospital.

1395
01:28:39,082 --> 01:28:40,640
Rana works for me.

1396
01:28:43,387 --> 01:28:45,753
Mrs. Bagchi, do you
remember what I said.

1397
01:28:46,356 --> 01:28:48,415
We've been looking for
Milan for the past two years.

1398
01:28:50,093 --> 01:28:53,028
And we had this last
option to find him.

1399
01:28:54,298 --> 01:28:57,199
You. You could do what we couldn't.

1400
01:28:57,234 --> 01:28:59,759
But you ruined the entire plan.

1401
01:29:01,738 --> 01:29:05,299
Actually, Mrs. Bagchi, there's
someone in the organization..

1402
01:29:05,375 --> 01:29:07,206
..who is helping Milan.

1403
01:29:08,145 --> 01:29:10,841
Mr. Khan couldn't
reopen the case himself.

1404
01:29:12,215 --> 01:29:14,115
So he asked for my help.

1405
01:29:15,018 --> 01:29:18,215
..so that we can
find Milan through you.

1406
01:29:18,622 --> 01:29:19,714
Do you love your job?

1407
01:29:19,790 --> 01:29:20,814
Yes, sir.

1408
01:29:20,891 --> 01:29:22,051
From today you will work for me.

1409
01:29:26,163 --> 01:29:27,221
Why me?

1410
01:29:27,698 --> 01:29:29,996
Because no one's
scared of a pregnant woman.

1411
01:29:30,167 --> 01:29:31,828
Especially one whose
husband has run away.

1412
01:29:32,135 --> 01:29:33,193
No one would've doubted.

1413
01:29:34,171 --> 01:29:37,766
But, Mrs. Bagchi,
only because of you..

1414
01:29:38,742 --> 01:29:42,678
..we could find out that Milan is
responsible for Vijay's death too.

1415
01:29:42,913 --> 01:29:47,009
And we could reach Shridhar
only because of you, Mrs. Bagchi.

1416
01:29:47,985 --> 01:29:51,978
You were using me.

1417
01:29:52,022 --> 01:29:52,954
Yes.

1418
01:29:55,726 --> 01:29:58,286
Your case was revived
only because of me..

1419
01:30:00,197 --> 01:30:02,165
..because Arnab looks just like Milan.

1420
01:30:02,232 --> 01:30:03,426
But we don't have time for..

1421
01:30:03,734 --> 01:30:04,723
And Agnes?

1422
01:30:05,202 --> 01:30:05,998
Dr. Ganguly?

1423
01:30:06,103 --> 01:30:07,229
Collateral damage.

1424
01:30:07,938 --> 01:30:09,633
One needs to make small
sacrifices in big battles..

1425
01:30:09,740 --> 01:30:10,832
..what's the big deal?

1426
01:30:10,874 --> 01:30:12,739
And me? My child?

1427
01:30:13,176 --> 01:30:15,337
Nothing would've happened to you.

1428
01:30:16,279 --> 01:30:17,337
I wouldn't have allowed it.

1429
01:30:17,948 --> 01:30:20,212
I took up this
assignment only because of you.

1430
01:30:27,691 --> 01:30:30,251
Mrs. Bagchi, we wanted Shridhar alive.

1431
01:30:30,360 --> 01:30:31,952
He was the only one
who could've lead us..

1432
01:30:32,029 --> 01:30:34,088
..to the man who is helping
Milan from within the system.

1433
01:30:34,965 --> 01:30:36,125
Listen to me carefully.

1434
01:30:36,199 --> 01:30:37,666
We have one last option.

1435
01:30:38,001 --> 01:30:39,832
You have hacked Shridhar's computer.

1436
01:30:40,370 --> 01:30:43,032
Do it again. We might find a clue.

1437
01:30:43,340 --> 01:30:44,807
Why should I help you?

1438
01:30:45,142 --> 01:30:48,373
I am not asking for
your help, Mrs. Bagchi.

1439
01:30:48,679 --> 01:30:49,668
I am telling you.

1440
01:30:49,746 --> 01:30:51,873
Mrs. Bagchi. Mrs. Bagchi.

1441
01:32:52,803 --> 01:32:54,100
Bishnu!

1442
01:34:00,337 --> 01:34:01,634
Mr. Khan.

1443
01:34:08,612 --> 01:34:10,739
This is the only code
that I don't understand.

1444
01:34:11,615 --> 01:34:12,946
Rest of the computer is clean.

1445
01:34:12,983 --> 01:34:15,315
CXWWEDFXZS.

1446
01:34:15,585 --> 01:34:16,609
Is that all you found?

1447
01:34:42,112 --> 01:34:44,307
Rana. Any idea?

1448
01:34:45,882 --> 01:34:47,645
No. I don't know.

1449
01:34:50,120 --> 01:34:51,246
What can it be?

1450
01:34:57,894 --> 01:34:58,986
Give me your phone, sir.

1451
01:34:59,062 --> 01:35:05,194
CXWWEDFXZS.

1452
01:35:08,038 --> 01:35:10,097
Sir, I feel this is a mobile number.

1453
01:35:14,277 --> 01:35:15,904
This is Bhaskaran's number.

1454
01:35:18,848 --> 01:35:20,008
What the..

1455
01:35:21,318 --> 01:35:23,946
Mrs. Bagchi. You will have
to do one last thing for me.

1456
01:35:24,587 --> 01:35:25,713
Mrs. Bagchi.

1457
01:35:28,091 --> 01:35:29,353
Are you listening?

1458
01:35:29,926 --> 01:35:30,824
Mrs. Bagchi.

1459
01:35:34,864 --> 01:35:35,956
Call Bhaskaran.

1460
01:35:36,700 --> 01:35:37,826
And lie to him that..

1461
01:35:37,934 --> 01:35:40,061
..you found some data about
him on Shridhar's computer?

1462
01:35:41,071 --> 01:35:42,595
Why should I do that?

1463
01:35:42,639 --> 01:35:44,334
Because Bhaskaran
is our last chance..

1464
01:35:44,975 --> 01:35:46,806
..to find Arnab and Milan.

1465
01:35:54,951 --> 01:35:56,213
Mrs. Bagchi.

1466
01:35:58,288 --> 01:36:01,052
I have always been rude with you..

1467
01:36:02,192 --> 01:36:05,923
This time it's a request, so..

1468
01:36:10,900 --> 01:36:11,992
Please help me.

1469
01:36:18,041 --> 01:36:19,167
Mr. Bhaskaran.

1470
01:36:19,242 --> 01:36:20,140
Yes.

1471
01:36:20,210 --> 01:36:21,234
Who is this?

1472
01:36:21,311 --> 01:36:23,176
This is Vidya Bagchi speaking.

1473
01:36:23,646 --> 01:36:24,977
Where did you get my number from?

1474
01:36:25,048 --> 01:36:26,845
From Shriddhar's computer.

1475
01:36:27,317 --> 01:36:29,182
I have found some more
papers in your name.

1476
01:36:29,285 --> 01:36:30,309
So?

1477
01:36:30,587 --> 01:36:35,081
Look, I don't care about
who you are or what you do.

1478
01:36:35,158 --> 01:36:37,092
I will return all your papers..

1479
01:36:37,127 --> 01:36:41,894
..in return I want the
government to help me find my husband.

1480
01:36:41,965 --> 01:36:44,957
Look, I don't know
why you are calling me.

1481
01:36:45,001 --> 01:36:46,935
I will inform my local office.

1482
01:36:46,970 --> 01:36:48,995
They will contact you.

1483
01:36:59,349 --> 01:37:00,611
Now?

1484
01:37:09,125 --> 01:37:10,217
If you want to see
your husband alive..

1485
01:37:10,326 --> 01:37:11,884
..then wait for my call.

1486
01:37:17,700 --> 01:37:18,860
Milan Damji.

1487
01:37:23,106 --> 01:37:26,098
Yes, I need a big brown envelope.

1488
01:37:27,744 --> 01:37:28,972
Okay.

1489
01:37:37,220 --> 01:37:38,278
Hello.

1490
01:37:52,402 --> 01:37:53,699
How are you?

1491
01:37:54,270 --> 01:37:55,328
Fine.

1492
01:37:59,742 --> 01:38:01,039
I had to make a promise.

1493
01:38:02,245 --> 01:38:03,405
But before that..

1494
01:38:06,816 --> 01:38:07,942
..this is for you.

1495
01:38:08,751 --> 01:38:10,275
Today's the last day of the Puja.

1496
01:38:18,695 --> 01:38:19,389
I cannot take this.

1497
01:38:19,696 --> 01:38:20,958
No, no, no, Mrs. Bagchi, this..

1498
01:38:21,764 --> 01:38:24,699
I still have the receipt.

1499
01:38:25,135 --> 01:38:26,727
I wanted to promise you that..

1500
01:38:28,404 --> 01:38:30,634
..I will help you in finding Arnab.

1501
01:38:31,908 --> 01:38:35,275
And when we find him, I will
make him pay for this sari.

1502
01:38:38,281 --> 01:38:41,182
This is from Arnab, not me.

1503
01:38:44,954 --> 01:38:46,148
I am sorry, Mrs. Bagchi.

1504
01:38:47,123 --> 01:38:48,249
I am really very sorry.

1505
01:38:58,735 --> 01:38:59,861
Thank you.

1506
01:39:03,306 --> 01:39:04,398
Sorry.

1507
01:39:08,811 --> 01:39:09,971
Paresh Pal.

1508
01:39:11,147 --> 01:39:12,011
Yes, Paresh.

1509
01:39:12,115 --> 01:39:14,208
You were asking about
Milan Damji, weren't you?

1510
01:39:14,350 --> 01:39:15,612
Yes, did you find out anything?

1511
01:39:15,885 --> 01:39:18,012
The news is that he
has returned to Kolkata.

1512
01:39:18,354 --> 01:39:21,289
Wow. Then Khan
sir's plan is working.

1513
01:39:21,658 --> 01:39:24,058
Only Milan can come see Vidya.

1514
01:39:24,260 --> 01:39:26,023
Bhaskaran doesn't
have any other option.

1515
01:39:26,129 --> 01:39:27,153
Vidya?

1516
01:39:27,397 --> 01:39:28,329
Yes.

1517
01:39:28,631 --> 01:39:30,360
As soon as Milan comes to
see her, he will be caught.

1518
01:39:31,134 --> 01:39:33,898
You want to sacrifice a helpless girl?

1519
01:39:34,003 --> 01:39:35,971
No, no, no, this isn't my plan.

1520
01:39:36,039 --> 01:39:37,165
This is Khan sir's plan.

1521
01:39:37,407 --> 01:39:38,999
And Mrs. Bagchi..

1522
01:39:42,178 --> 01:39:43,145
Move.

1523
01:39:43,246 --> 01:39:43,940
Call him up.

1524
01:39:44,047 --> 01:39:44,843
Sir, sir.

1525
01:39:44,948 --> 01:39:45,744
Sir, I am sorry.

1526
01:39:45,848 --> 01:39:46,678
Just a minute.

1527
01:39:46,749 --> 01:39:48,376
We will have to stop this
operation at any cost, sir.

1528
01:39:48,651 --> 01:39:49,083
Yes.

1529
01:39:49,185 --> 01:39:51,813
If Milan meets Mrs. Bagchi,
then her life is in danger.

1530
01:39:51,988 --> 01:39:52,352
So?

1531
01:39:52,655 --> 01:39:53,383
You don't understand, sir.

1532
01:39:53,923 --> 01:39:55,390
Milan never leaves
behind any eye-witness.

1533
01:39:55,658 --> 01:39:56,852
He will do the same
this time as well.

1534
01:39:57,727 --> 01:40:00,321
So, we will try to
save your Mrs. Bagchi.

1535
01:40:02,232 --> 01:40:03,358
You know, sir.

1536
01:40:03,933 --> 01:40:05,230
You know, yet you are..

1537
01:40:05,301 --> 01:40:06,268
Sacrificing her.

1538
01:40:06,970 --> 01:40:08,130
This is wrong.

1539
01:40:08,171 --> 01:40:09,001
You are intentionally..

1540
01:40:09,072 --> 01:40:09,731
Shut up.

1541
01:40:09,839 --> 01:40:11,670
You want to teach
me right and wrong.

1542
01:40:11,808 --> 01:40:13,241
My job is to protect the country..

1543
01:40:13,343 --> 01:40:15,607
..and anything I do for that is right.

1544
01:40:16,079 --> 01:40:19,845
If I have to sacrifice Vidya
Bagchi to catch Milan Damji..

1545
01:40:19,916 --> 01:40:20,746
..then that's right too.

1546
01:40:20,850 --> 01:40:22,750
Then what is the difference
between us and Milan, sir?

1547
01:40:23,052 --> 01:40:24,076
There's no difference.

1548
01:40:25,355 --> 01:40:27,653
We do it for the law and
he does it against the law.

1549
01:40:28,124 --> 01:40:29,819
That's why we are
right and he's wrong.

1550
01:40:32,862 --> 01:40:34,124
Love is a good thing, Rana.

1551
01:40:34,264 --> 01:40:35,993
But learn to use it
at the right place.

1552
01:40:36,833 --> 01:40:37,731
Meaning?

1553
01:40:37,867 --> 01:40:42,361
Your love that's telling you Go
tell Vidya Bagchi about Khan.

1554
01:40:42,905 --> 01:40:43,997
That's wrong.

1555
01:40:44,774 --> 01:40:46,207
This way you can save only one life..

1556
01:40:46,276 --> 01:40:48,972
..but what about thousands of
lives that Milan will take?

1557
01:40:50,079 --> 01:40:51,910
I wasn't going to tell her, sir, but..

1558
01:40:52,015 --> 01:40:53,676
Rajveer, take his mobile.

1559
01:40:54,083 --> 01:40:55,209
Don't let him go anywhere.

1560
01:40:55,351 --> 01:40:56,079
Not even to the bathroom.

1561
01:40:59,789 --> 01:41:01,086
No, sir. Nothing important.

1562
01:41:02,025 --> 01:41:03,686
Yes, so what were you saying?

1563
01:42:05,922 --> 01:42:07,082
Bidya didi.

1564
01:42:08,124 --> 01:42:09,056
Bidya didi.

1565
01:42:27,176 --> 01:42:28,200
Didi.

1566
01:42:50,333 --> 01:42:51,630
You are Sharma, aren't you?

1567
01:42:51,701 --> 01:42:52,167
Yes, why?

1568
01:42:52,201 --> 01:42:53,168
Khan sir is calling you.

1569
01:42:53,202 --> 01:42:54,032
Where?

1570
01:42:54,270 --> 01:42:56,636
In the AC.. OC chamber.

1571
01:42:57,073 --> 01:42:58,062
You go.

1572
01:42:58,207 --> 01:43:00,767
And he has asked me to sit here.

1573
01:43:01,210 --> 01:43:02,040
I will keep a watch on him.

1574
01:43:08,117 --> 01:43:09,675
Rana. Go.

1575
01:43:10,253 --> 01:43:11,220
Go, go.

1576
01:43:11,287 --> 01:43:12,117
What about you?

1577
01:43:12,155 --> 01:43:13,816
I will handle it here. Go.

1578
01:43:13,890 --> 01:43:14,788
Thank you, Chatterjee.

1579
01:43:18,294 --> 01:43:19,124
Rana.

1580
01:43:19,195 --> 01:43:19,752
Yes.

1581
01:43:19,829 --> 01:43:20,227
Where are you going?

1582
01:43:20,296 --> 01:43:21,354
I'll be right back.

1583
01:43:32,642 --> 01:43:33,836
Hello.

1584
01:43:37,914 --> 01:43:39,074
Triangular Park.

1585
01:43:42,618 --> 01:43:43,676
Hello.

1586
01:43:44,086 --> 01:43:45,348
Triangular Park. Triangular Park.

1587
01:43:45,655 --> 01:43:46,644
Get lost.

1588
01:43:47,390 --> 01:43:48,687
Sir, where is Rana?

1589
01:43:48,758 --> 01:43:49,918
To hell with him. Come on.

1590
01:43:50,993 --> 01:43:52,221
Rajveer, follow us.

1591
01:43:52,295 --> 01:43:53,284
Come on, hurry up.

1592
01:43:53,329 --> 01:43:54,796
Come on, come on, hurry up.

1593
01:44:00,970 --> 01:44:01,937
Where is Mrs. Bagchi?

1594
01:44:02,038 --> 01:44:03,300
She paid her dues and left.

1595
01:44:03,406 --> 01:44:03,929
Where did she go?

1596
01:44:04,040 --> 01:44:05,405
Didi went to Triangular Park.

1597
01:45:31,227 --> 01:45:32,592
Mrs. Bagchi.

1598
01:46:39,962 --> 01:46:41,361
Take a left from here, Mrs. Bagchi.

1599
01:47:08,958 --> 01:47:10,050
Mrs. Bagchi.

1600
01:47:12,228 --> 01:47:13,695
Where are the files?

1601
01:47:13,929 --> 01:47:15,191
Who are you?

1602
01:47:16,132 --> 01:47:17,656
What difference does it make?

1603
01:47:18,367 --> 01:47:19,834
Files.

1604
01:47:21,037 --> 01:47:22,698
Milan Damji..

1605
01:47:24,740 --> 01:47:26,037
..who was just a story until now.

1606
01:47:26,142 --> 01:47:27,734
I have very little time, Mrs. Bagchi.

1607
01:47:28,711 --> 01:47:31,874
If you want your husband back Files.

1608
01:47:33,015 --> 01:47:34,676
If I return the papers then..

1609
01:47:35,017 --> 01:47:36,382
..will you return me my husband?

1610
01:47:36,686 --> 01:47:38,244
Yes. Files.

1611
01:47:43,225 --> 01:47:44,692
Can you return him?

1612
01:47:46,128 --> 01:47:47,322
Think about it.

1613
01:50:04,233 --> 01:50:05,427
Who are you?

1614
01:50:06,702 --> 01:50:07,862
What difference does it make?

1615
01:50:21,383 --> 01:50:24,216
Mrs. Bagchi. Mrs. Bagchi.

1616
01:50:34,897 --> 01:50:35,989
Catch her.

1617
01:50:36,632 --> 01:50:37,963
Check him. Check him.

1618
01:50:39,301 --> 01:50:40,962
Catch her. She's
wearing a white sari.

1619
01:50:42,771 --> 01:50:44,033
I said she's wearing a white sari.

1620
01:50:44,139 --> 01:50:45,197
Are you blind?

1621
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:46,365
Who was Mrs. Bagchi?

1622
01:51:46,402 --> 01:51:48,233
Vidya Bagchi was a story, sir?

1623
01:51:48,304 --> 01:51:49,669
Meaning?

1624
01:51:51,373 --> 01:51:52,340
Where is Mrs. Bagchi?

1625
01:51:52,374 --> 01:51:53,671
Didi went to Triangular Park.

1626
01:51:53,776 --> 01:51:55,038
Triangular Park.

1627
01:52:02,051 --> 01:52:03,746
This is a flying swan.

1628
01:52:05,821 --> 01:52:06,913
Where did you find this uniform?

1629
01:52:06,989 --> 01:52:09,287
This? It's my school uniform.

1630
01:52:09,792 --> 01:52:11,783
Back when I lived in Thakurpukur.

1631
01:52:11,894 --> 01:52:14,055
Any uncle. Anyone.

1632
01:52:15,097 --> 01:52:17,327
He has an uncle, who
lives in Thakurpukur.

1633
01:52:17,633 --> 01:52:18,895
Did you ever tell
Didi Vidya about this?

1634
01:52:18,968 --> 01:52:20,902
Yes, when we met for the first time.

1635
01:52:21,203 --> 01:52:23,671
I have heard many stories about it.

1636
01:52:28,744 --> 01:52:30,371
Check her hotel room
and her finger prints.

1637
01:52:30,679 --> 01:52:31,839
It's of no use, sir.

1638
01:52:31,914 --> 01:52:33,211
Why are you cleaning it yourself?

1639
01:52:35,317 --> 01:52:36,147
What?

1640
01:52:36,251 --> 01:52:38,116
Just one sign and
then you can leave.

1641
01:52:38,687 --> 01:52:39,813
Sign here.

1642
01:52:40,055 --> 01:52:40,987
Here.

1643
01:52:41,056 --> 01:52:42,819
And her husband, Arnab?

1644
01:52:43,192 --> 01:52:44,989
Oh, so you haven't
understood yet, sir.

1645
01:52:45,627 --> 01:52:46,218
What?

1646
01:52:46,295 --> 01:52:48,160
In the beginning,
you told her a story.

1647
01:52:48,263 --> 01:52:50,094
There is no one called Milan.

1648
01:52:50,165 --> 01:52:51,063
Yes, so?

1649
01:52:51,166 --> 01:52:52,929
And she told us a story.

1650
01:52:53,035 --> 01:52:54,024
My husband is missing.

1651
01:52:54,136 --> 01:52:55,899
Arnab Bagchi didn't stay here.

1652
01:52:55,938 --> 01:52:56,836
No, dear.

1653
01:52:56,939 --> 01:52:58,736
He didn't leave
London or land in Kolkata.

1654
01:52:58,841 --> 01:53:00,172
Milan was for real, sir.

1655
01:53:00,242 --> 01:53:03,302
But there is no
Vidya Bagchi nor Arnab..

1656
01:53:03,746 --> 01:53:05,077
..who looks like Milan.

1657
01:53:05,180 --> 01:53:06,169
Arnab didn't like to
get his picture taken.

1658
01:53:06,248 --> 01:53:08,113
Until Agnes didn't see
Arnab's photo properly.

1659
01:53:08,183 --> 01:53:11,277
And the day we find Milan,
we will find Arnab.

1660
01:53:12,187 --> 01:53:13,848
What the..

1661
01:53:15,791 --> 01:53:17,053
That means until now..

1662
01:53:17,126 --> 01:53:17,854
Correct.

1663
01:53:17,926 --> 01:53:19,120
She kept using us.

1664
01:53:20,262 --> 01:53:22,992
Sir, it seems like
Vidya Bagchi was hired..

1665
01:53:23,032 --> 01:53:24,932
..to find and kill Milan Damji.

1666
01:53:25,034 --> 01:53:27,901
And she used us to find Milan.

1667
01:53:28,137 --> 01:53:30,867
She wanted us to use
her as a scapegoat..

1668
01:53:30,906 --> 01:53:32,601
..to find Milan Damji.

1669
01:53:32,841 --> 01:53:34,934
And before we could arrest Shridhar.

1670
01:53:35,110 --> 01:53:36,338
Vidya killed him as well.

1671
01:53:36,812 --> 01:53:40,248
Sir, you gave Bhaskaran
and Milan to her yourself.

1672
01:53:40,315 --> 01:53:41,213
She knew.

1673
01:53:41,250 --> 01:53:43,844
No one doubts a pregnant woman.

1674
01:53:51,927 --> 01:53:53,326
What did you take from my computer?

1675
01:53:56,865 --> 01:53:58,162
Who is Satyoki?

1676
01:53:58,967 --> 01:54:00,264
Arjun's charioteer.

1677
01:54:04,873 --> 01:54:05,862
That's me, sir.

1678
01:54:06,075 --> 01:54:07,337
My name is Satyoki.

1679
01:54:09,144 --> 01:54:10,702
But who sent her?

1680
01:54:11,146 --> 01:54:12,704
And why did she help us?

1681
01:55:03,665 --> 01:55:04,791
Arup.

1682
01:55:09,171 --> 01:55:12,106
Sorry, we couldn't
save your child.

1683
01:55:21,083 --> 01:55:24,610
Arup took up this assignment
only because I forced him to.

1684
01:55:27,789 --> 01:55:30,121
It's completely my fault.

1685
01:55:51,246 --> 01:55:53,146
Arup must be really
happy today, Vidya.

1686
01:55:55,684 --> 01:55:57,276
He must be proud of you.

1687
01:55:59,621 --> 01:56:01,851
Because today you have accomplished..

1688
01:56:02,191 --> 01:56:03,818
..what we all couldn't.

1689
01:56:07,029 --> 01:56:08,963
You want to know a
strange thing, Colonel.

1690
01:56:10,332 --> 01:56:11,993
In the last few days..

1691
01:56:12,701 --> 01:56:14,999
..I completely forgot
that I am not pregnant.

1692
01:56:16,939 --> 01:56:18,907
It felt like..

1693
01:56:20,209 --> 01:56:22,200
..my child is still alive inside me.

1694
01:56:26,014 --> 01:56:27,743
It felt like..

1695
01:56:28,750 --> 01:56:30,615
I might find Arup as well.

1696
01:56:35,824 --> 01:56:38,657
I cannot live without them, Colonel.

1697
01:56:39,194 --> 01:56:41,788
I want my Arup back.

1698
01:56:42,965 --> 01:56:46,901
I want my child back.

1699
01:56:59,014 --> 01:57:01,209
Today, two years later.

1700
01:57:02,384 --> 01:57:04,875
The family of those
killed in the Metro attack..

1701
01:57:05,887 --> 01:57:07,946
..have finally got an answer.

1702
01:57:14,930 --> 01:57:17,330
Sometimes even
God's make mistakes.

1703
01:57:18,734 --> 01:57:20,634
Gods created demons.

1704
01:57:20,702 --> 01:57:22,033
Bestowed them with power.

1705
01:57:22,938 --> 01:57:25,930
But when they started
abusing that power..

1706
01:57:26,875 --> 01:57:29,173
..Gods created Mother Durga.

1707
01:57:30,178 --> 01:57:32,169
To destroy the demons.

1708
01:57:35,917 --> 01:57:38,784
It's said that Goddess Durga..

1709
01:57:39,221 --> 01:57:40,984
..was created by gathering
the strength of all the mothers

1710
01:57:42,357 --> 01:57:44,018
Every year the Mother
graces us with her presence.

1711
01:57:44,926 --> 01:57:46,359
Eliminates evil.

1712
01:57:47,663 --> 01:57:48,960
And goes back.

1713
01:57:58,907 --> 01:58:02,343
So that all of us can live
happily and peacefully..

1714
01:58:03,245 --> 01:58:05,941
..without any fear.
