Topping the preliminary round
with 29 out of 30...

24
00:04:16,975 --> 00:04:21,938
Bangalore Uni A,
represented by Naman Bala...

25
00:04:23,106 --> 00:04:25,108
Ramu Iyengar...

26
00:04:25,942 --> 00:04:27,652
Ilash Ismail...

27
00:04:27,736 --> 00:04:29,571
- Where's Ilash?

28
00:04:29,654 --> 00:04:32,657
- ...and Ajay Iyer.
- Ajay.

29
00:04:34,117 --> 00:04:37,996
Will the team captain
please come up for the draw of lots?

30
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:40,415
B.U.B.U.

31
00:04:40,499 --> 00:04:42,209
Team captain?

32
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:44,377
Hmm...

33
00:04:45,253 --> 00:04:48,799
Bangalore Uni A team has finally arrived.

34
00:04:49,925 --> 00:04:55,472
In the words of Shakespeare, better three
hours too soon than a minute too late.

35
00:04:56,181 --> 00:04:59,059
You will have to sit in row six.

36
00:04:59,142 --> 00:05:03,855
We should have come for the draft lots.
Row six is the worst strategically.

37
00:05:04,606 --> 00:05:08,193
Who cares where we sit?
We'll win anyway.

38
00:05:08,276 --> 00:05:11,404
We have worse problems.
Ilash is in Hyderabad.

39
00:05:11,488 --> 00:05:12,948
Good luck, Naman!

40
00:05:13,865 --> 00:05:16,493
There's your pet volcano, Stromboli.

41
00:05:16,576 --> 00:05:18,912
Go rape your cow, Ra-moo.

42
00:05:18,995 --> 00:05:22,541
Come on, ra. Give her Etna a chance.

43
00:05:22,624 --> 00:05:25,794
Yeah, cover the face, fire the base.

44
00:05:25,877 --> 00:05:28,088
Are all the teams complete?

45
00:05:34,636 --> 00:05:37,305
I have been preparing.
I'll be very helpful, I promise.

46
00:05:37,389 --> 00:05:40,684
Just keep your mouth shut
and we'll win, okay?

47
00:05:40,767 --> 00:05:43,979
--Bangalore Uni B.

48
00:05:44,062 --> 00:05:45,814
Back in the 18th century,

49
00:05:45,897 --> 00:05:51,236
Eton College had a grammar book
which listed a set of words from Latin

50
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:54,573
which all meant "of little or no value."

51
00:05:54,656 --> 00:05:59,160
As a joke, somebody put all four of these
together and created a new word.

52
00:05:59,244 --> 00:06:05,584
The first recorded use
is by William Shenstone in 1741.

53
00:06:05,667 --> 00:06:07,168
What is the word?

54
00:06:08,378 --> 00:06:10,839
Looks like our juniors
have Calcutta ambitions.

55
00:06:11,631 --> 00:06:15,594
Why go all the way to Calcutta when
the Black Hole of Bangalore is right here?

56
00:06:15,677 --> 00:06:17,178
Time is running out!

57
00:06:17,929 --> 00:06:21,600
The answer is
floccinaucinihilipilification.

58
00:06:22,559 --> 00:06:24,269
Correct answer.

59
00:06:24,352 --> 00:06:26,896
Bangalore B are the leaders now.

60
00:06:28,189 --> 00:06:32,819
And now for the ultimate question
to decide the winner.

61
00:06:33,653 --> 00:06:39,367
Gerald Rusgrove and Charles
founded a publishing house in 1908.

62
00:06:39,451 --> 00:06:42,996
Today they dominate a particular genre.

63
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:48,168
The company is named after
their famous surname. Name the company.

64
00:06:49,002 --> 00:06:51,338
-Simon & Schuster?
-Hodder & Stoughton?

65
00:06:51,421 --> 00:06:54,507
They don't dominate any particular genre.

66
00:06:57,093 --> 00:07:01,348
Bangalore University A,
do we have an answer?

67
00:07:04,309 --> 00:07:06,353
Is it Mills & Boon? Romance?

68
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:09,230
It is...

69
00:07:12,609 --> 00:07:13,777
indeed!

70
00:07:15,987 --> 00:07:21,826
Bangalore Uni A
are the winners of this quiz contest,

71
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:27,290
and will represent us at the
All India Quiz Competition in Calcutta.

72
00:07:27,374 --> 00:07:29,167
--Thank you.

73
00:07:36,049 --> 00:07:38,802
-Naman.
-We won book coupons worth 750 rupees.

74
00:07:38,885 --> 00:07:40,261
That's your share.

75
00:07:40,345 --> 00:07:44,557
No, that's not necessary. It was my honor
to be in the quiz with you.

76
00:07:48,269 --> 00:07:50,480
I insist. After all--

77
00:07:50,563 --> 00:07:54,526
Listen, Ash, we have 500 worth of
book coupons between the three of us.

78
00:07:54,609 --> 00:07:57,904
We'll sell it to you
at the usual discount. 300?

79
00:07:57,988 --> 00:08:00,323
Done. But on one condition.

80
00:08:00,407 --> 00:08:02,659
I get to come with you guys
wherever you are drinking tonight.

81
00:08:02,742 --> 00:08:05,453
Forget it. We'll find somebody else.

82
00:08:05,537 --> 00:08:06,955
No, no, no, no, no.

83
00:08:07,706 --> 00:08:10,083
I always keep cash handy for your coupons.

84
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,721
Bye.

85
00:08:29,811 --> 00:08:32,147
Sure you don't want a lift to the<i> dhaba?</i>

86
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:34,482
-Ajay isn't dead.
-Yet.

87
00:08:42,741 --> 00:08:44,451
Hey, you, junior!

88
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:53,376
What's your name?

89
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,797
-Randeep.
-Randy!

90
00:09:04,637 --> 00:09:07,807
I, uh... I don't really drink.

91
00:09:07,891 --> 00:09:10,185
Nonsense. Everybody drinks.

92
00:09:10,268 --> 00:09:11,728
It's like fucking.

93
00:09:11,811 --> 00:09:13,897
Once your dick is inside the hole,

94
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:17,233
it goes all the way up to the cervix,
prompting the inevitable--

95
00:09:17,317 --> 00:09:18,651
Cervix with a smile.

96
00:09:22,197 --> 00:09:24,783
Chairs!

97
00:09:27,827 --> 00:09:31,039
-Bangalore University, bottoms up.
-B.U.B.U.

98
00:09:32,123 --> 00:09:33,249
Go!

99
00:09:38,755 --> 00:09:41,800
-Naman seven secs, Ajay nine secs.
-And Randy, no sex.

100
00:09:42,634 --> 00:09:45,095
-Bravo.
<i>-Garçon.</i>

101
00:09:51,768 --> 00:09:54,395
What ra, dei?
That would have bought an extra pitcher.

102
00:09:54,479 --> 00:09:56,981
Brahmans must be magnanimous
to the servant classes

103
00:09:57,065 --> 00:09:59,734
- to preserve the natural order of things.
- Correct.

104
00:09:59,818 --> 00:10:02,278
If everybody gets degrees,
who will clean our toilets?

105
00:10:02,362 --> 00:10:05,615
In our village, even if an untouchable's
shadow touches my grandfather,

106
00:10:05,698 --> 00:10:07,200
he has to have a bath.

107
00:10:08,701 --> 00:10:09,786
The boy speaks.

108
00:10:13,957 --> 00:10:17,293
Trichinopolies.
As smoked by Sherlock Holmes.

109
00:10:20,588 --> 00:10:22,924
OK, guys, I have to leave.
My father will be waiting.

110
00:10:23,007 --> 00:10:26,970
Ever wondered why the back
of Ramu's neck is black?

111
00:10:27,053 --> 00:10:31,558
When Ramu was born, his father
rubbed his dick on the back of his neck.

112
00:10:39,274 --> 00:10:44,028
Randy. If you continue to be
this correct blend of slavish deference

113
00:10:44,112 --> 00:10:48,199
and obsequiousness to God, i.e. me,

114
00:10:48,283 --> 00:10:51,244
who knows,
someday you could be our quiz team fourth.

115
00:10:53,079 --> 00:10:58,376
-But I'm in Tina's team--
-Tina, Beena? Who cares? All cunts.

116
00:10:59,419 --> 00:11:02,130
Stay second all your life, by all means.

117
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:03,965
It's your choice.

118
00:11:06,718 --> 00:11:07,886
Well?

119
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:24,444
-He's done a George.
-Horses for courses.

120
00:11:24,527 --> 00:11:25,528
Neigh!

121
00:11:29,532 --> 00:11:32,619
You won't be allowed into Valhalla
if you don't know the argot.

122
00:11:34,078 --> 00:11:36,456
I'll give you a clue. Painter.

123
00:11:36,539 --> 00:11:40,460
John Stubbs. British painter
best known for his paintings of horses.

124
00:11:40,543 --> 00:11:44,672
So when you "do a George,"
you stub out a cigar.

125
00:11:46,424 --> 00:11:49,052
May the horse be with you.

126
00:11:58,686 --> 00:12:01,773
A beaker full of the warm south
for the lad here.

127
00:12:04,233 --> 00:12:06,945
But you're not allowed
to vomit on the tree.

128
00:12:08,696 --> 00:12:15,536
But if you must, precision is key,
oh dilated pupil.

129
00:12:58,037 --> 00:13:04,585
As it says in
the holy Gita, "tranquility, restraint,

130
00:13:04,669 --> 00:13:10,967
austerity, purity,
forgiveness, uprightness...

131
00:13:11,801 --> 00:13:15,930
knowledge, wisdom and faith in God

132
00:13:16,014 --> 00:13:18,141
are the duties of the Brahmans...

133
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:21,477
born of our innate nature."

134
00:13:58,556 --> 00:13:59,557
Naman.

135
00:14:45,019 --> 00:14:47,480
I feel like a new hermaphrodite again.

- Henry.
- A trick.

163

When you've finished,
let go of your dick when you cum.

<i>-Chee chee,</i> Ramu.

176
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:54,625
- Nice arse.
- You will not, none of you,

177
00:17:54,709 --> 00:17:58,170
refer to your future sister-in-law
in a sexual manner ever again.

178
00:17:58,254 --> 00:18:00,006
Ramu! Understood?

179
00:19:29,512 --> 00:19:31,180
Naman?

180
00:19:57,832 --> 00:20:01,127
You must be wondering what<i> The Merchant</i>
<i>of Venice</i> has to do with<i> Hamlet.</i>

181
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:05,381
You see, this Polonius is a dirty fellow.

182
00:20:05,464 --> 00:20:07,091
Very shallow.

183
00:20:07,174 --> 00:20:11,011
What he doesn't know is that
is if he spits into the air... pooo!

184
00:20:16,934 --> 00:20:18,853
Hey, maths motherfucker.

185
00:20:21,272 --> 00:20:23,357
To what do we owe this dubious honor?

186
00:20:23,441 --> 00:20:27,737
I was in the vicinity, so I thought
I'd come see if you're around.

187
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:33,033
Now that you have drunk your ocular fill,
wench, a swift departure mayhaps.

188
00:20:33,117 --> 00:20:35,828
Miles to go? Promises to keep?

189
00:20:35,911 --> 00:20:38,706
- But I...
- So, handicap.

190
00:20:38,789 --> 00:20:42,501
- Ilash.
- Who came second in the quiz?

191
00:20:42,585 --> 00:20:44,462
-The junior team.
-Oh...

192
00:20:44,545 --> 00:20:47,256
Let me tell you what happened
to my junior.

193
00:20:47,339 --> 00:20:52,011
I was coming back from Hyderabad
on a train, AC first class, of course,

194
00:20:52,094 --> 00:20:55,431
and there she was, on the lower berth.

195
00:20:55,514 --> 00:20:58,934
It was lights out,
so I put my reading lights on

196
00:20:59,018 --> 00:21:04,440
and I looked down through the curtains
and she is staring straight back at me.

197
00:21:06,442 --> 00:21:09,403
So I pull back, I'm reading my book.

198
00:21:10,196 --> 00:21:11,989
She climbs up...

199
00:21:12,823 --> 00:21:17,369
and she's... all over me, OK?

200
00:21:19,497 --> 00:21:21,916
She's rubbing.

201
00:21:23,667 --> 00:21:26,212
She's rubbing herself.

202
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,651
Where has that fellow gone?

203
00:21:48,734 --> 00:21:51,695
I'm sure he's taken
our ticket money and run.

204
00:21:51,779 --> 00:21:53,697
Have faith, grasshopper.

205
00:21:53,781 --> 00:21:55,157
There he is.

206
00:22:08,754 --> 00:22:09,755
Thank you, uncle.

207
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:11,757
Your seats are right next to mine.

208
00:22:15,511 --> 00:22:17,096
I feel violated.

209
00:22:19,849 --> 00:22:21,517
Isn't there a law against visual rape?

210
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,603
In that case, we would all be doing
ten to 20.

211
00:22:52,339 --> 00:22:53,382
Ramu.

212
00:22:57,970 --> 00:22:59,138
<i>Appa.</i>

213
00:22:59,221 --> 00:23:00,431
Get in.

214
00:23:09,857 --> 00:23:14,069
You have to do everything possible
to endear us of Ramu's dad, don't you?

215
00:23:30,836 --> 00:23:35,716
"My love is like a red, red rose
that is newly sprung in June.

216
00:23:36,342 --> 00:23:39,386
My love is like a melody
that is sweetly played in tune."

217
00:23:40,179 --> 00:23:41,639
To the chariot!

218
00:23:45,934 --> 00:23:48,604
-What am I supposed to do?
-Exist.

219
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:32,731
- D'Souza, she's not a Brahman.
- So?

220
00:24:32,815 --> 00:24:35,734
- She's not even a Hindu.
- So?

221
00:24:35,818 --> 00:24:37,319
She's a Christian, ra.

222
00:24:38,237 --> 00:24:41,532
In Brahman tradition, one would conjoin
with the servant classes

223
00:24:41,615 --> 00:24:44,493
in order to transfer our sins to them,
because they are fucked anyway.

224
00:24:44,576 --> 00:24:46,161
Justification.

225
00:24:47,037 --> 00:24:50,457
You know how the Jesuits forcibly
converted most of us to Christianity?

226
00:24:50,541 --> 00:24:53,711
-Her grandparents are probably Brahman.
-Justification.

227
00:24:54,586 --> 00:24:56,797
The scriptures say
that the role of a Brahman

228
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,049
is to uplift the downtrodden classes.

229
00:24:59,133 --> 00:25:01,385
Miss D'Souza will be my project.

230
00:25:01,468 --> 00:25:03,178
Infatuation.

231
00:25:11,478 --> 00:25:15,274
Dear Rita, shall I compare thee
to a summer's day?

232
00:25:15,357 --> 00:25:17,317
But then I'm not the Bard.

233
00:25:17,401 --> 00:25:21,530
Interestingly, did you know
that Colonel Gaddafi of Libya

234
00:25:21,613 --> 00:25:24,408
claimed that William Shakespeare
was actually a Muslim Libyan

235
00:25:24,491 --> 00:25:26,118
named Wali Miya Sheikh Zubair.

236
00:25:28,871 --> 00:25:32,958
There is also loose talk that a certain
Sheshappa Iyer, a Brahman from Mysore,

237
00:25:33,041 --> 00:25:35,419
went to England and authored the plays.

238
00:25:37,796 --> 00:25:39,506
But enough of Avon.

239
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:45,095
The Butler, in his immortal piece of poesy
titled, rather appropriately,

240
00:25:45,179 --> 00:25:47,431
<i>A Drinking Song,</i> he quoth...

241
00:25:50,184 --> 00:25:51,935

00:25:59,276 --> 00:26:00,277
Thank you, Mother.

243
00:26:08,744 --> 00:26:12,456

Rita, Gita or Sita...

00:26:34,978 --> 00:26:38,941
You boys are just going to...
beat-a your meat-a.

Ronnie! Ronnie! Ronnie! Ronnie!

254
00:26:49,535 --> 00:26:51,787
Devastating wit. I'm impressed.

255
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:56,208
Smart boy. But while you guys were busy
polishing your pathetic one-liners,

256
00:26:56,291 --> 00:27:00,128
-we just won the cricket championship.
-Let joy be unconfined.

257
00:27:00,212 --> 00:27:02,589
Tell me one physical activity
that you guys can do better than us.

258
00:27:02,673 --> 00:27:05,092
-Consume alcohol.
-In industrial quantities.

259
00:27:06,677 --> 00:27:08,637
-Done. It's a challenge.
-A royal challenge?

260
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:11,974
Tomorrow at home, our victory party.

261
00:27:12,057 --> 00:27:15,477
Get yourselves to Sadashivnagar
and ask anyone for Palace Tower.

262
00:27:15,561 --> 00:27:18,438
-Then see whose is bigger.
-We don't go for half measures.

263
00:27:18,522 --> 00:27:21,483
Ronnie, I'm hungry.

264
00:27:21,567 --> 00:27:23,110
Burger?

265
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,078
-I can't believe we get the brains--
-And they get the girls.

266
00:27:33,161 --> 00:27:36,748
That too, Coco-panties herself.

267
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:39,835
Many a boat has sailed up
that coconut lagoon.

268
00:28:00,397 --> 00:28:01,940
Rich bastard.

269
00:28:03,859 --> 00:28:08,155
Ramu, "a man of wealth has many enemies,

270
00:28:08,238 --> 00:28:10,866
while a man of knowledge
has many friends."

271
00:28:22,878 --> 00:28:25,130
Oh-ho-ho-ho!

272
00:28:25,213 --> 00:28:29,801
So kind of you all to drag yourselves away
from your busy schedules.

273
00:28:29,885 --> 00:28:31,261
Must have been a drag.

274
00:28:32,262 --> 00:28:34,097
Ever used one of these babies before?

275
00:28:34,181 --> 00:28:37,476
-You have overcompensation issues.
-So you don't know how to use it?

276
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:39,436
Just pose.

277
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:40,979
Girls...

278
00:28:46,318 --> 00:28:49,780
So what do you think of the old pad?
Pretty impressive, huh?

279
00:28:50,697 --> 00:28:53,909
-Very Las Vegas.
-Dad's favorite city. We go every year.

280
00:28:53,992 --> 00:28:56,578
And where do you go for your hols,
big boy?

281
00:28:57,955 --> 00:29:01,083
I must inform you that we have
an excellent bovine maintenance--

282
00:29:01,166 --> 00:29:04,878
A cow farm? Ramu goes to a cow farm!

283
00:29:04,962 --> 00:29:07,589
I also heard you rape your cows.

284
00:29:07,673 --> 00:29:09,508
That's our joke.

285
00:29:09,591 --> 00:29:12,928
Here, have a drink.
Better than your normal swill, I'm sure.

286
00:29:14,346 --> 00:29:16,848
-B.U.B.U.
-What else?

287
00:29:20,894 --> 00:29:23,897
Do you do everything so fast?

288
00:29:23,981 --> 00:29:26,233
He wouldn't know, baby.
He's never done it.

289
00:29:27,901 --> 00:29:29,361
Those who can't drink
should not throw stones.

290
00:29:29,444 --> 00:29:32,072
OK, bugger, put your mouth
where the bottle is.

291
00:29:35,826 --> 00:29:37,953
<i>Praemonitus, praemunitus.</i>

292
00:29:38,036 --> 00:29:39,663
-Huh?
-Forewarned is forearmed.

293
00:29:39,746 --> 00:29:43,458
<i>Treatises of Fistula,</i> circa 1425,
J. Arderne.

294
00:29:43,542 --> 00:29:47,212
-Also Don Quixote's<i> Cervantes--</i>
-Just shut up and drink, quiz fucks.

295
00:30:01,393 --> 00:30:02,728
Drinks, I say!

296
00:30:17,242 --> 00:30:18,577
I think my father is calling me.

297
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:31,631
Look what I found.

298
00:30:32,924 --> 00:30:34,801
Naman takes the bottle...

299
00:30:35,969 --> 00:30:38,472
uncorks it...

300
00:30:39,473 --> 00:30:42,059
and sniffs it deeply.

301
00:30:44,353 --> 00:30:48,190
A deep, rich and complex nose.

302
00:30:50,817 --> 00:30:52,819
-Dry orange peel.
-Mmm.

303
00:30:53,945 --> 00:30:55,530
Espresso.

304
00:30:56,198 --> 00:30:59,868
And incandescent notes of Gruyère
and smoked Parma ham.

305
00:30:59,951 --> 00:31:01,828
But you're vegetarian.

306
00:31:07,334 --> 00:31:10,003
I'm married. So...

307
00:31:11,922 --> 00:31:15,133
-You flick, I'll click.
-OK!

308
00:31:22,349 --> 00:31:23,725
I can't do it.

309
00:31:26,937 --> 00:31:29,731
- It's the fault of our caste.

310
00:31:29,815 --> 00:31:31,566
Why are we Brahmans so conservative?

311
00:31:32,567 --> 00:31:36,321
Oh, for a bit of Labour
in these Tory times!

312
00:31:37,072 --> 00:31:39,408
Such a waste!

313
00:31:43,662 --> 00:31:48,333
There is, however,
another course of action.

314
00:32:04,015 --> 00:32:04,975
So!

315
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,728
-Back again from Hyderabad?
-On a plane.

316
00:32:09,479 --> 00:32:11,273
Business class, of course.

317
00:32:11,356 --> 00:32:14,943
There was this, uh... mwah!
...girl next to me.

318
00:32:15,026 --> 00:32:18,530
-So you started feeling her up.
-Why didn't you fuck?

319
00:32:19,656 --> 00:32:21,116
Who said I didn't?

320
00:32:21,867 --> 00:32:23,493
There was this toilet.

321
00:32:23,577 --> 00:32:26,413
-And you joined the mile-high club.
-Coffee, tea or me?

322
00:32:26,496 --> 00:32:29,458
The uninhibited memoirs
of two airline stewardesses.

323
00:32:29,541 --> 00:32:31,084
-Rachel Jones.
-Trudy Baker.

324
00:32:31,168 --> 00:32:35,297
No, no, I used a Pleasure Sutra condom.

325
00:32:37,174 --> 00:32:39,342
- God promise.

326
00:32:44,473 --> 00:32:48,185
Wow, you guys are actually
attending class.

327
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:52,939
-It's Wednesday.
-Coco-panties day.

328
00:32:53,023 --> 00:32:55,650
What is the color of the color TV?

329
00:33:28,767 --> 00:33:30,769
I say white.

330
00:33:30,852 --> 00:33:33,313
I'm a dirty fellow, so I would say yellow.

331
00:33:33,396 --> 00:33:36,441
-Pink. Think pink.
-Red.

332
00:33:45,534 --> 00:33:49,496
Class. Today, that sonnet without equal.
The esteemed...

333
00:33:49,579 --> 00:33:52,541
"Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?

334
00:33:52,624 --> 00:33:56,253
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.

335
00:33:56,336 --> 00:33:59,631
Rough winds do shake
the darling buds of May,

336
00:33:59,714 --> 00:34:03,385
and summer's lease
hath all too short a date."

337
00:34:03,468 --> 00:34:07,556
And your lease will also expire shortly
if you don't stop that infernal giggling.

338
00:34:09,182 --> 00:34:12,602
In that case, my darling buds of May,
kindly pollinate away.

339
00:34:13,895 --> 00:34:17,607
This is a first.
Ronnie wanting to contribute to a class.

340
00:34:17,691 --> 00:34:20,026
-Speak!
-Or forever hold your piss.

341
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:22,153
Quiz team, out now.

342
00:34:22,237 --> 00:34:27,659
Sir, by "pollinate away,"
are you asking the girls to eff off?

343
00:34:27,742 --> 00:34:29,494
Your private tuitions are helping.

344
00:34:30,912 --> 00:34:33,456
"Exit stage right, pursued by bear."

345
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:35,959
Looks like the cricket team
comes in a package deal.

346
00:34:36,042 --> 00:34:38,128
Good things come in big packages.

347
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:42,465
You can touch my silly point
with your fine leg any time.

348
00:34:46,428 --> 00:34:49,556
Your middle stump is very long.

349
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:52,350
The stitches on your balls
seem quite nice.

350
00:34:56,354 --> 00:34:59,482
I'm sure you had
something to do with this. Thanks.

351
00:34:59,566 --> 00:35:02,485
Oh, and uh, enjoy your pocket billiards.

352
00:35:12,037 --> 00:35:13,705
Fucking lounge lizards.

353
00:35:16,833 --> 00:35:20,003
<i>♪ Oh, you asshole ♪</i>

354
00:35:20,086 --> 00:35:23,673
<i>♪ Completely loathsome pain in the bum ♪</i>

355
00:35:27,344 --> 00:35:30,722
<i>♪ Brahman Naman</i>
<i>Fuck you up ♪</i>

356
00:35:32,182 --> 00:35:35,226
Enough is enough. Let's call Henry.

357
00:35:42,067 --> 00:35:44,027
Coming, coming!

358
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:46,946
Coming.

359
00:35:48,156 --> 00:35:50,075
"Coming, coming."

360
00:35:50,158 --> 00:35:52,535
Save some cum for the bitches!

361
00:35:52,619 --> 00:35:55,080
A man and his cum are soon parted.

362
00:35:56,081 --> 00:35:59,209
Something to get us in the mood.

363
00:35:59,292 --> 00:36:01,044
What mood?

364
00:36:01,127 --> 00:36:05,173
All you need is a hooker and a hard-on.

365
00:36:09,302 --> 00:36:15,308
<i>♪ Well, show me the way</i>
<i>to the next little girl ♪</i>

366
00:36:15,392 --> 00:36:18,061
<i>♪ Oh, don't ask why ♪</i>

367
00:36:18,144 --> 00:36:20,605
<i>♪ Oh, don't ask why ♪</i>

368
00:36:20,689 --> 00:36:25,819
<i>♪ Just show me the way</i>
<i>to the next little girl... ♪</i>

369
00:36:28,822 --> 00:36:31,241
I always like a starter
before the main course.

370
00:36:31,324 --> 00:36:33,284
Best way to start innings.

371
00:36:35,954 --> 00:36:40,125
50 rupees lollipop.
75 rupees mouthwash. 100 rupees full.

372
00:36:40,208 --> 00:36:42,085
Lollipop. Get inside.

373
00:36:47,048 --> 00:36:49,426
No, no, no, stay!

374
00:36:49,509 --> 00:36:52,929
When stadium is full,
batsman always performs better. Come on.

375
00:37:26,463 --> 00:37:28,798
Give me 75 rupees, mouthwash.

376
00:37:29,632 --> 00:37:31,384
Fifty-one secs!

377
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,988
Now, your chance.

378
00:37:57,535 --> 00:38:00,163
-This is it, boys.
-Uh, Henry...

379
00:38:00,246 --> 00:38:03,249
Hey! You Brahman boys
have got the guts or no?

380
00:38:03,333 --> 00:38:05,084
Maybe for safety's sake, just a lollipop.

381
00:38:05,168 --> 00:38:07,378
Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome
and all that.

382
00:38:09,172 --> 00:38:12,717
Your money, your choice. Come.

383
00:38:24,938 --> 00:38:25,939
Uh...

384
00:38:26,022 --> 00:38:32,362
My friends, uh, they want blowjobs,
mouthwash, lollipop.

385
00:38:36,115 --> 00:38:37,826
What friends? Huh?

386
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:47,585
Uh... Blowjob?

387
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:34,173
Did you know
that this area was gerrymandered?

388
00:39:34,257 --> 00:39:35,508
Gerry who?

389
00:39:36,217 --> 00:39:38,595
Named after Massachusetts governor
Elbridge Gerry,

390
00:39:38,678 --> 00:39:40,305
who manipulated his electoral district

391
00:39:40,388 --> 00:39:42,348
so that the people who voted for him
the last time

392
00:39:42,432 --> 00:39:44,309
voted in a block for him the next time.

393
00:39:44,392 --> 00:39:46,477
And cut away the people
who did not vote for him,

394
00:39:46,561 --> 00:39:49,564
-and put them into another district.
-Correct.

395
00:39:50,064 --> 00:39:55,403
They did the same thing here to prevent
the Muslim candidate from winning again,

396
00:39:55,486 --> 00:39:58,615
adding a large Hindu majority block
to dilute the vote.

397
00:39:59,449 --> 00:40:00,950
What?

398
00:40:01,034 --> 00:40:04,370
Right now we could have been
in between the thighs of whores,

399
00:40:04,454 --> 00:40:06,164
losing our virginities.

400
00:40:06,247 --> 00:40:08,625
And here we are trading electoral trivia.

401
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,588
That at all we have, Ajay.

402
00:40:15,715 --> 00:40:17,175
Trivia.

403
00:40:19,427 --> 00:40:20,261
Correct.

404
00:40:23,806 --> 00:40:28,353
<i> Rubber On. Set up in the year 1972,</i>

405
00:40:28,436 --> 00:40:33,191
<i>with a dogged determination</i>
<i>to achieve world-class standards,</i>

406
00:40:33,274 --> 00:40:38,196
<i>Rubber On is India's finest</i>
<i>rubberized coil mattress.</i>

407
00:40:38,279 --> 00:40:41,366
<i>With technology imported from Austria,</i>

408
00:40:41,449 --> 00:40:45,161
<i>a dedicated workforce of more than 70,</i>

409
00:40:45,244 --> 00:40:50,708
<i>Rubber On strives to be the mattress</i>
<i>of copulation to the nation's population.</i>

410
00:40:50,792 --> 00:40:54,921
<i>A mattress that always ensures</i>
<i>a healthy hump,</i>

411
00:40:55,004 --> 00:41:00,259
<i>optimizing orgasm frequency</i>
<i>and facilitating fluid flow.</i>

412
00:41:00,343 --> 00:41:03,179
<i>As is said by the holy Rita,</i>

413
00:41:03,262 --> 00:41:08,559
<i>a bed with the best booby bounce</i>
<i>results in deeper penetration.</i>

414
00:41:08,643 --> 00:41:12,814
<i>Rubbing, rubbing, rubbing.</i>

415
00:41:12,897 --> 00:41:15,900
<i>Who do you think I built up</i>
<i>the business</i> <i>for?</i>

416
00:41:18,486 --> 00:41:21,781
After my retirement,
Rubber On will be only for you.

417
00:41:21,864 --> 00:41:23,992
Coffee? Buttermilk?

418
00:41:24,075 --> 00:41:27,078
-Half a cup for me.
-Nothing for me, Ma.

419
00:41:27,161 --> 00:41:31,958
When I was your age, I used to wake up
at 4 a.m., milk the cows,

420
00:41:32,041 --> 00:41:36,921
wake up my brothers, make myself coffee,
have a bath,

421
00:41:37,005 --> 00:41:40,508
then go all the way to the Christian house
to give their children maths tuition.

422
00:41:40,591 --> 00:41:43,803
-Then I would--
-Go to grandfather's accountancy firm.

423
00:41:43,886 --> 00:41:45,388
Tell me something new, Appa.

424
00:41:45,471 --> 00:41:48,683
Hard work was our only ethic.

425
00:41:48,766 --> 00:41:51,144
And here you are drunk every night.

426
00:41:51,227 --> 00:41:53,479
You worked so hard
so that I wouldn't have to, Appa.

427
00:41:53,563 --> 00:41:55,940
Plus I'm paying for my drinks
with my own quizzing money.

428
00:41:56,024 --> 00:41:58,735
Quizzing? What will happen after college?

429
00:41:58,818 --> 00:42:02,697
Will your quizzing feed you
for the rest of your life?

430
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:06,868
To keep up with the times,
I'm importing new machinery from Austria.

431
00:42:06,951 --> 00:42:09,579
The unique feature
of this main sheeting plant

432
00:42:09,662 --> 00:42:13,499
is that it facilitates
vertical fiber orientation.

433
00:42:13,583 --> 00:42:18,921
A process that results in the deeper
penetration of the latex into the sheet,

434
00:42:19,005 --> 00:42:21,382
making it very classic.

435
00:42:21,466 --> 00:42:25,470
This provides the mattress
with a uniform density throughout

436
00:42:25,553 --> 00:42:28,181
and an extra cushioning effect.

437
00:42:28,264 --> 00:42:32,018
There you have a mattress
that is healthy for your back.

438
00:42:33,352 --> 00:42:36,230
What? Time for another quiz?

439
00:42:36,314 --> 00:42:37,774
Calcutta, Appa.

440
00:42:51,162 --> 00:42:52,705
Naman!

441
00:42:55,041 --> 00:42:57,251
- Naman.
- What?

442
00:42:58,294 --> 00:43:01,756
I just came to wish you good luck.
And goodbye.

443
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:06,928
Well, you have.
Therefore,<i> dasvidanya, arrivederci.</i>

444
00:43:08,054 --> 00:43:10,181
Is there anything you need
for the journey?

445
00:43:10,264 --> 00:43:11,516
No.

446
00:43:12,683 --> 00:43:15,603
Actually, yes. Come with me.

447
00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:18,397
Hello, Ash.

448
00:43:27,323 --> 00:43:30,493
Ask for Rita.
It's easy if it's a girl's voice.

449
00:43:33,037 --> 00:43:36,165
Hello. May I speak to Rita, please?

450
00:43:54,809 --> 00:43:57,687
- Hello?
<i>-  Hello?</i>

451
00:43:58,771 --> 00:43:59,647
Hi, Rita.

452
00:44:02,024 --> 00:44:06,154
-Who's this?
<i>-This is an admirer.</i>

453
00:44:06,237 --> 00:44:07,488
Admirer?

454
00:44:08,698 --> 00:44:10,366
Uh, I sent you that letter.

455
00:44:10,449 --> 00:44:12,285
<i>What letter?</i>

456
00:44:12,368 --> 00:44:15,746
- The one with the perfume.

457
00:44:18,124 --> 00:44:19,375
Hello?

458
00:44:19,458 --> 00:44:20,793
Hello?

459
00:44:21,544 --> 00:44:23,796
-Hello?
<i>-Hello? Rita?</i>

460
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:26,674
- Hello? Are you in a station?

461
00:44:27,466 --> 00:44:28,342
Yes.

462
00:44:29,468 --> 00:44:32,513
Are you coming... or going?

463
00:44:33,139 --> 00:44:35,266
I... I don't know.

464
00:44:38,728 --> 00:44:42,940
Hello? Did you know you're the most
beautiful person on this Earth?

465
00:44:44,150 --> 00:44:45,359
<i>Hello?</i>

466
00:44:45,443 --> 00:44:47,361
Rita, hello? I love you.

467
00:44:57,747 --> 00:44:59,373
- Come on.

468
00:45:06,839 --> 00:45:10,343
You made it.
I was going to pull the chain.

469
00:45:10,426 --> 00:45:12,303
What happened to Ramu?

470
00:45:12,386 --> 00:45:15,097
He didn't ask his father for permission.

471
00:45:15,181 --> 00:45:16,933
There goes the fourth member for the quiz.

472
00:45:17,016 --> 00:45:20,686
I may be old, but I'm not dead yet.

473
00:45:20,770 --> 00:45:22,897
According to the rules
of the championship,

474
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:25,900
your chaperone is allowed
to step into the breach.

475
00:45:26,692 --> 00:45:28,277
That's all good, then.

476
00:45:28,361 --> 00:45:31,238
Sir, can we play some music?

477
00:45:31,322 --> 00:45:34,617
-What? Can you repeat the question?
-Can we play some music?

478
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:38,621
If music be the food of love, play on.

479
00:46:01,811 --> 00:46:06,148
What is this noise? The other people
have complained, you know.

480
00:46:06,232 --> 00:46:09,485
Sir, we are young.
Can enjoy only once.

481
00:46:09,568 --> 00:46:12,238
-Maintain decency.
-Definitely, sir.

482
00:46:43,602 --> 00:46:48,065
Padma R, F-18. Naina K, F-18.

483
00:46:48,149 --> 00:46:51,610
These F-18s can bomb my airbase anytime!

484
00:46:51,694 --> 00:46:54,071
Rani P, F-17.

485
00:46:54,155 --> 00:46:56,907
Augusta D, F-58.

486
00:46:58,784 --> 00:47:03,831
Unfortunately, here, if I'm not very much
mistaken, are the exhibits themselves.

487
00:47:03,914 --> 00:47:06,876
These look one drop kick away
from an arranged marriage.

488
00:47:17,553 --> 00:47:20,639
Sir, why does Madras exist, as a concept?

489
00:47:22,099 --> 00:47:25,853
You know, I have a deathly relationship
with Madras.

490
00:47:25,936 --> 00:47:29,106
The first time I passed through the city,
the chief minister died.

491
00:47:29,190 --> 00:47:30,941
The second time, the governor died.

492
00:47:31,025 --> 00:47:34,195
This time, I hope
the cursed minorities die.

493
00:47:34,904 --> 00:47:37,198
Sir, surely that's a bit bigoted.

494
00:47:37,281 --> 00:47:38,657
Bigoted, shigoted.

495
00:47:38,741 --> 00:47:42,161
We Brahmans are the biggest
bigots and racists on this planet.

496
00:47:42,244 --> 00:47:46,207
Why be ashamed of it?
Revel in your supremacy, I say.

497
00:47:46,290 --> 00:47:48,209
Quarter kilo.

498
00:47:51,712 --> 00:47:53,672
-Naman?
-Sir?

499
00:47:53,756 --> 00:47:56,759
-Dig out that gin bottle.
-Huh?

500
00:47:56,842 --> 00:47:59,637
I may be old, but I'm not blind. Yet.

501
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:02,681
An old man is allowed
to enjoy his drink, too.

502
00:48:02,765 --> 00:48:08,646
Cherry in the gin is cherry on the cake.

503
00:48:12,733 --> 00:48:14,401
Are all of you in your cups?

504
00:48:14,485 --> 00:48:16,862
-Cheese to the bees.
-Cheers to the beers.

505
00:48:16,946 --> 00:48:20,074
-Diamonds are forever.
-Cherries to the berries.

506
00:48:23,619 --> 00:48:27,248
The aspiring chief minister
is not dead yet.

507
00:48:27,331 --> 00:48:29,291
But that can change.

508
00:48:29,917 --> 00:48:33,796
She used to live down my street
when she was a schoolgirl.

509
00:48:33,879 --> 00:48:37,133
The bitch in her green school uniform,

510
00:48:37,216 --> 00:48:42,138
skirt ending just below her panties.

511
00:48:42,221 --> 00:48:44,723
She literally dripped
as she walked along the street.

512
00:48:44,807 --> 00:48:49,854
And the dogs on heat
followed the bitch in heat.

513
00:48:56,152 --> 00:48:57,862
Ch-- Ch--

514
00:48:57,945 --> 00:49:00,531
Chrysalis, I believe that's the word
you were struggling for.

515
00:49:01,407 --> 00:49:03,242
Away from the parental cocoon.

516
00:49:03,325 --> 00:49:07,538
Not to mention the most conservative city
in the world.

517
00:49:08,372 --> 00:49:11,542
-Madras.
-The nympha become butterflies.

518
00:49:11,625 --> 00:49:13,836
Interesting that you use the word
"nympha."

519
00:49:13,919 --> 00:49:17,715
If you're going to flog that old
nymphomaniac joke, forget it.

520
00:49:17,798 --> 00:49:21,552
Be that as it may,
whatever mania you girls subscribe to,

521
00:49:21,635 --> 00:49:24,305
you seem to be of the quizzing persuasion.

522
00:49:24,388 --> 00:49:28,434
You don't need much persuasion
in a Brahman family, sir.

523
00:49:28,517 --> 00:49:32,605
Study, study, study.
Quizzing is good for you.

524
00:49:32,688 --> 00:49:36,317
I mean, who will marry you if you don't
have at least a postgraduate degree?

525
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:39,862
That is correct. Who will indeed?

526
00:49:41,155 --> 00:49:44,158
-Have we seen you in Bangalore quizzes?
-We've seen you.

527
00:49:44,241 --> 00:49:46,785
-We were at the South Zone championship.
-Which we won.

528
00:49:46,869 --> 00:49:48,370
Oh, really, how could you tell?

529
00:49:51,874 --> 00:49:54,752
I'm Randeep... Randy.

530
00:49:55,669 --> 00:49:57,463
Padma. Paddy.

531
00:49:57,546 --> 00:49:59,840
No predictable Irish jokes, please.

532
00:49:59,924 --> 00:50:03,052
I was going for the rice theme. I'm Ajay.

533
00:50:03,969 --> 00:50:06,263
-Rani.
-Yasmin.

534
00:50:06,347 --> 00:50:07,264
Naina.

535
00:50:08,557 --> 00:50:10,434
He's Naman, our team captain.

536
00:50:10,517 --> 00:50:14,688
I have seen Trappist monks
speak more than your team captain.

537
00:50:14,772 --> 00:50:19,568
Forget it. He's in love. With me.

538
00:50:22,905 --> 00:50:24,865
<i> Where was she all my wife?</i>

539
00:50:25,991 --> 00:50:27,618
Madras.

540
00:50:30,037 --> 00:50:31,997
You really must be in love.

541
00:50:32,873 --> 00:50:34,375
What makes you say that?

542
00:50:35,251 --> 00:50:38,379
Physical action instead of
a smart verbal comeback.

543
00:50:38,462 --> 00:50:40,256
But what can I do?

544
00:50:41,173 --> 00:50:42,675
Talk to her, maybe.

545
00:50:44,051 --> 00:50:45,511
It's been known to work.

546
00:50:48,222 --> 00:50:50,432
I'm going to try and chat with Paddy.

547
00:50:52,142 --> 00:50:54,603
-How about Rita?
-Who?

548
00:51:03,112 --> 00:51:05,030
So, the essence of my book,

549
00:51:05,114 --> 00:51:08,450
which I am titling
<i>Nostradamus's Inevitable Hinduism,</i>

550
00:51:08,534 --> 00:51:12,997
is that your superstar Christ
was in fact sired by a Roman guard.

551
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:15,749
Tiberius Iulius Abdes Pantera.

552
00:51:15,833 --> 00:51:18,877
- Centurion much higher than a god.
- How quaint.

553
00:51:18,961 --> 00:51:22,715
Clearly there were traces of
miscegenation in your own family tree,

554
00:51:22,798 --> 00:51:26,760
-hence you're out to taint Christianity.
-No, no, there is proof.

555
00:51:26,844 --> 00:51:31,265
The Greek philosopher Celsus
said so in his work<i> Alethès Lógos.</i>

556
00:51:31,348 --> 00:51:35,144
-Which was refuted by his friend Origen--
-In his eight-volume work<i> Contra Celsum.</i>

557
00:51:37,730 --> 00:51:41,817
Naina, can I have a word with you alone?

558
00:51:44,403 --> 00:51:48,490
No. No mixing with boys.
What would your father say?

559
00:51:48,574 --> 00:51:50,868
Let her go, O Augusta Delphin.

560
00:51:50,951 --> 00:51:56,749
They are typical quiz boys.
Harmless, gutless, feckless.

561
00:51:58,876 --> 00:52:03,714
Clearly your protégés, then,
Bernard Judekumar Irudayarasan.

562
00:52:03,797 --> 00:52:07,676
I'll have you know, Miss Augusta,
that in 1968,

563
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:12,181
when I used to come to your school,
there was not a single...

564
00:52:14,224 --> 00:52:16,810
Well, none for me?

565
00:52:16,894 --> 00:52:18,979
A beaker full of the warm south.

566
00:52:19,063 --> 00:52:20,939
The blushful Hippocrene.

567
00:52:23,817 --> 00:52:25,569
You know your stuff.

568
00:52:27,029 --> 00:52:28,030
Mmm.

569
00:52:28,113 --> 00:52:30,199
It's a funny thing about knowledge.

570
00:52:30,282 --> 00:52:32,868
It's been known for more than one person
to have it.

571
00:52:32,951 --> 00:52:36,163
-That's not what I meant.
-That is exactly what you meant.

572
00:52:36,246 --> 00:52:39,583
But you didn't say what you meant
when you said that--

573
00:52:39,666 --> 00:52:41,377
That you were in love with me.

574
00:52:42,544 --> 00:52:44,713
It's painfully obvious.

575
00:52:44,797 --> 00:52:51,220
I am good-looking,
smart, female, Brahman,

576
00:52:51,303 --> 00:52:54,223
now imbibing alcoholic libations with you.

577
00:52:54,306 --> 00:52:59,061
I even speak in that funny convoluted way
that quizzers seem to automatically adopt.

578
00:52:59,645 --> 00:53:03,565
And if I were to ask you for that cigar,
you would propose right away.

579
00:53:04,775 --> 00:53:08,237
And I'm not awed
by your quiz-champ status.

580
00:53:11,156 --> 00:53:13,659
You know so much about me. How?

581
00:53:13,742 --> 00:53:15,494
I've seen you onstage.

582
00:53:15,577 --> 00:53:17,246
Admired me from afar.

583
00:53:17,955 --> 00:53:21,708
Seen you onstage. You are a great quizzer.

584
00:53:21,792 --> 00:53:28,590
Brahman fundamentalist, alcoholic,
sexist, et cetera, et cetera.

585
00:53:28,674 --> 00:53:30,300
Thanks.

586
00:53:30,384 --> 00:53:33,303
And only you would take that
as a compliment.

587
00:53:35,055 --> 00:53:39,601
-You still haven't answered.
-I still don't know what the question is.

588
00:53:42,646 --> 00:53:44,898
<i> Are you coming or going?</i>

589
00:53:44,982 --> 00:53:46,150
<i>Forget it.</i>

590
00:53:46,233 --> 00:53:47,568
-Brahman family.
-Naman.

591
00:53:47,651 --> 00:53:48,735
- Rita?
- Naina.

592
00:53:48,819 --> 00:53:50,612
- <i> She's a Christian, ra.</i>
- No!

593
00:53:52,948 --> 00:53:55,659
And what was worse,
was that I lost a fortune

594
00:53:55,742 --> 00:53:58,454
due to termites getting
into my deposit box.

595
00:53:59,705 --> 00:54:01,457
Sir, what happened?

596
00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:03,584
We're stuck at the Orissa-Bengal border.

597
00:54:03,667 --> 00:54:05,878
The ruling party has called for
a<i> bandh,</i> a general strike.

598
00:54:05,961 --> 00:54:08,380
No movement for the next 12 hours.

599
00:54:12,134 --> 00:54:15,846
-And the reserve, sir?
-I finished it all while you were asleep.

600
00:54:15,929 --> 00:54:17,639
Miss Augusta helped.

601
00:54:18,891 --> 00:54:21,393
And the train has run out of food.

602
00:54:21,477 --> 00:54:23,187
Wake up, bastard.

603
00:54:24,688 --> 00:54:27,483
--Wake up, bastard, wake up.

604
00:55:19,243 --> 00:55:20,327
Nipple.

605
00:55:22,955 --> 00:55:23,914
Aureolae.

606
00:55:29,211 --> 00:55:31,129
We need food.

607
00:55:32,172 --> 00:55:33,173
Booze.

608
00:55:34,925 --> 00:55:36,385
Train.

609
00:55:40,097 --> 00:55:41,306
Stop.

610
00:55:41,390 --> 00:55:43,016
Food, food.

611
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:44,726
Aah...

612
00:55:45,435 --> 00:55:47,396
And, uh, booze, booze.

613
00:55:47,479 --> 00:55:48,772
Mmm.

614
00:55:55,279 --> 00:55:56,154
Booze.

615
00:57:13,774 --> 00:57:15,609
Sorry.

616
00:57:15,692 --> 00:57:17,569
In China--

617
00:57:17,653 --> 00:57:22,616
Belching is considered to be a sign
of gratitude and satisfaction. I know.

618
00:57:23,867 --> 00:57:26,787
-Always a step ahead.
-Obviously.

619
00:57:28,372 --> 00:57:34,127
Anyway, I am grateful and satisfied.
Thank you for getting all this.

620
00:57:34,211 --> 00:57:38,757
Well, when one is described
as gutless and harmless--

621
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:41,176
You left out feckless.

622
00:57:41,259 --> 00:57:44,554
James Joyce used the word "feck"
as a synonym for stealing.

623
00:57:44,638 --> 00:57:48,183
In<i> A Portrait of the Artist</i>
<i>as a Young Man. </i>Yeah.

624
00:57:49,059 --> 00:57:52,354
-Not bad.
-For a girl?

625
00:57:53,063 --> 00:57:56,400
-No. Not bad per se.
-Oh.

626
00:57:56,483 --> 00:57:59,027
A compliment. Not grudging.

627
00:58:01,488 --> 00:58:07,619
You were right when you said
that I don't really even understand--

628
00:58:07,703 --> 00:58:11,498
-Naman, don't you have a girlfriend?
-Yes.

629
00:58:11,581 --> 00:58:14,710
No. Not yet.

630
00:58:15,669 --> 00:58:18,005
Either way, you're unfaithful.

631
00:58:18,088 --> 00:58:23,427
No doubt you have some twisted
Brahman justification to explain it away.

632
00:58:23,510 --> 00:58:24,803
He does.

633
00:58:24,886 --> 00:58:27,973
Naina, Augusta ma'am says it's bedtime.

634
00:58:28,056 --> 00:58:31,560
- The last song on the--
<i>- White Album.</i> Good night.

635
00:58:48,785 --> 00:58:51,121
You realize who Naina is, don't you?

636
00:58:52,539 --> 00:58:53,707
Who?

637
00:58:55,625 --> 00:58:57,085
She's you, Naman.

638
00:58:59,463 --> 00:59:01,214
Female Naman.

639
00:59:04,134 --> 00:59:08,138
So, if you fuck her...

640
00:59:10,265 --> 00:59:12,225
it'll be like fucking yourself.

641
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:18,857
That makes it homo sex.

642
00:59:28,325 --> 00:59:30,243
- Good evening, everybody.

643
00:59:30,327 --> 00:59:34,039
How's Calcutta doing today?
How's Calcutta doing today?

644
00:59:34,122 --> 00:59:35,957
--Very good.

645
00:59:36,041 --> 00:59:39,419
This year is a very special year

646
00:59:39,503 --> 00:59:44,007
because we are celebrating
the 17th anniversary of quizzing in India,

647
00:59:44,091 --> 00:59:46,802
which, as you all know,
began right here in Calcutta.

648
00:59:46,885 --> 00:59:51,056
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Quiz Superstars.

649
00:59:51,681 --> 00:59:55,685
The biggest quiz in India,
and I'm Brian D'Costa.

650
00:59:56,686 --> 00:59:58,396
-Oh, less of brain.
-Yeah.

651
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:01,566
As usual, we have teams
from all across India,

652
01:00:01,650 --> 01:00:06,571
from Delhi, Bombay, Bangalore, Madras

653
01:00:06,655 --> 01:00:12,285
and, of course,
our very own kollolini Kolkata.

654
01:00:12,369 --> 01:00:14,996
--I have great news for you.

655
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:19,376
This year, our sponsors are not only
hosting the outstation teams,

656
01:00:19,459 --> 01:00:23,755
but are also paying for the food
and beverage expenses.

657
01:00:23,839 --> 01:00:27,259
-What did he say?
-He said drinks are on the house.

658
01:00:29,553 --> 01:00:33,431
India has a proud tradition of quizzing.

659
01:00:33,515 --> 01:00:37,435
This is because
we Indians thirst for knowledge...

660
01:00:38,395 --> 01:00:41,815
Hey. How are you? All well?
Good to see you.

661
01:00:41,898 --> 01:00:44,651
We Indians also revel
in displaying said knowledge.

662
01:00:44,734 --> 01:00:49,531
Trivia, esoterica, science, technology.

663
01:00:49,614 --> 01:00:53,910
-16 whiskeys, please. On the quiz tab.
-Yes, sir.

664
01:00:53,994 --> 01:00:58,915
...our very lovely scorer for tonight,
Kitty Chatterjee.

665
01:00:59,624 --> 01:01:04,921
You look absolutely gorgeous.
Come on up. Wonderful. Welcome.

666
01:01:05,547 --> 01:01:08,925
Can we have a big round of applause
for Kitty tonight? Thank you.

667
01:01:10,177 --> 01:01:14,514
Thank you so much. All right,
my next question is for Bangalore.

668
01:01:14,598 --> 01:01:16,808
Are you ready for this question?

669
01:01:16,892 --> 01:01:21,771
On Calcutta's suburban trains,
what are the pen sellers called?

670
01:01:21,855 --> 01:01:23,773
Your time starts now.

671
01:01:25,192 --> 01:01:27,777
This is a pass-on round... Yes?

672
01:01:27,861 --> 01:01:31,198
-Lalu-Bhulus.
-That is the right answer.

673
01:01:31,281 --> 01:01:34,367
Big round of applause, please.
Thank you so much.

674
01:01:34,451 --> 01:01:35,952
Kitty, two points for Bangalore.

675
01:01:36,036 --> 01:01:37,704
Delhi, my next question,

676
01:01:37,787 --> 01:01:41,416
who was the cowriter of<i> Layla,</i>
along with Eric Clapton?

677
01:01:41,499 --> 01:01:43,043
George Harrison.

678
01:01:43,126 --> 01:01:47,339
I'm sorry, that's the incorrect answer.
The question now passes to Madras.

679
01:01:47,964 --> 01:01:50,258
-What is the answer?
-Jim Gordon.

680
01:01:50,342 --> 01:01:52,010
Absolutely right! Perfect!

681
01:01:53,303 --> 01:01:58,058
Team Bangalore, which 1942 painting

682
01:01:58,141 --> 01:02:00,727
-depicts people in a downtown--
<i>-Nighthawks.</i>

683
01:02:00,810 --> 01:02:04,606
Perfect. Thank you so much.
Two points for Bangalore.

684
01:02:04,689 --> 01:02:08,652
Calcutta, the nationality
of Christopher Columbus.

685
01:02:08,735 --> 01:02:10,028
We guess he was Spanish.

686
01:02:10,111 --> 01:02:12,489
I am so sorry,
that's the incorrect answer.

687
01:02:12,572 --> 01:02:15,825
The question now passes to Bangalore.

688
01:02:15,909 --> 01:02:18,286
-Italy.
-Absolutely right.

689
01:02:18,370 --> 01:02:21,248
Bangalore is on a roll tonight.

690
01:02:21,331 --> 01:02:23,250
Who bowled him that first ball?

691
01:02:23,333 --> 01:02:25,919
-Graham McKenzie.
-That is perfectly right.

692
01:02:26,002 --> 01:02:29,547
-All right, Calcutta, what is the answer?
-1911.

693
01:02:29,631 --> 01:02:33,927
Absolutely right. May we have a big round
of applause for Calcutta! Thank you.

694
01:02:34,844 --> 01:02:38,139
This is a first. A tie.

695
01:02:38,223 --> 01:02:40,183
The reigning champions, Calcutta,

696
01:02:40,267 --> 01:02:46,398
and challengers Bangalore
are both tied on 32 points.

697
01:02:46,481 --> 01:02:48,775
As this is a winner-takes-all quiz,

698
01:02:48,858 --> 01:02:52,988
I shall now have to ask
a final tiebreaker question.

699
01:02:53,571 --> 01:02:54,990
Are you ready?

700
01:02:55,907 --> 01:02:59,160
Bangalore, this tiebreaker question
is for you.

701
01:02:59,244 --> 01:03:05,083
What is the American popular slang
for motels run by Indians?

702
01:03:06,001 --> 01:03:09,754
Most US hotels are run by Patels. Potels.

703
01:03:10,588 --> 01:03:11,423
What?

704
01:03:11,506 --> 01:03:13,383
Your time is running out,
Bangalore.

705
01:03:13,466 --> 01:03:16,720
- Oh, sorry. Can you repeat the question?
- Yes.

706
01:03:16,803 --> 01:03:22,225
What is the American popular slang
for motels run by Indians?

707
01:03:22,309 --> 01:03:26,813
Simple. Potels. Motels run by Patels.

708
01:03:28,690 --> 01:03:31,735
Bangalore, that is the wrong answer.

709
01:03:32,694 --> 01:03:35,280
Calcutta, it's your turn.

710
01:03:35,363 --> 01:03:38,158
I believe the correct answer
would be Patels.

711
01:03:38,241 --> 01:03:42,078
That is absolutely right.
Calcutta have the right answer!

712
01:03:42,162 --> 01:03:44,581
- Calcutta wins again!

713
01:03:44,664 --> 01:03:46,750
Potels, not Patels,
is the correct answer, sir.

714
01:03:46,833 --> 01:03:51,504
-Potels. Potels, Calcutta, potels.
-It's Patels.

715
01:03:52,714 --> 01:03:55,550
It's a fix. I knew it.

716
01:04:05,518 --> 01:04:10,940
I curse you,
you fucking brainless Brian baboon.

Sorry, Naman. You deserved to win.

721
01:04:48,812 --> 01:04:52,482
- It's a fix. That fucking brainless--

722
01:04:52,565 --> 01:04:53,775
Naman, this is my father.

723
01:04:53,858 --> 01:04:56,611
Sorry, uncle. It's just that--

724
01:04:56,694 --> 01:05:00,448
Whatever the scenario, the use of foul
language is not appropriate, young man.

725
01:05:01,533 --> 01:05:02,909
Sorry, uncle.

726
01:05:02,992 --> 01:05:04,577
What are you studying?

727
01:05:05,954 --> 01:05:09,416
Commerce. St. James, Bangalore, sir.

728
01:05:09,499 --> 01:05:12,669
It's a good college. What are your plans?

729
01:05:12,752 --> 01:05:16,297
-Plans?
-I mean career plans.

730
01:05:16,381 --> 01:05:19,551
You're studying B-com? Hello?

731
01:05:19,634 --> 01:05:21,845
You're studying B-com, next year, MBA?

732
01:05:21,928 --> 01:05:24,431
Sir, I haven't really decided.

733
01:05:25,598 --> 01:05:28,768
Well, that's a problem with today's boys.

734
01:05:28,852 --> 01:05:32,564
Look at my Naina. She's already preparing
for her MBA entrance.

735
01:05:35,233 --> 01:05:38,236
Naina, let me go and check the tickets.

736
01:05:40,822 --> 01:05:44,117
I'm so sorry.
He's not as bad as he sounds.

737
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:47,287
My father asks me the same questions.

738
01:05:48,663 --> 01:05:52,917
Anyway, what was he saying about
the tickets? Aren't you returning with us?

739
01:05:53,001 --> 01:05:54,919
No. Uh...

740
01:05:55,003 --> 01:05:58,006
We're going to Jamshedpur to see my aunt.

741
01:05:58,089 --> 01:06:01,134
-So when...?
-Who knows?

742
01:06:03,511 --> 01:06:04,721
And us?

743
01:06:04,804 --> 01:06:08,057
Naman, just because a girl spends time
with you on equal terms

744
01:06:08,141 --> 01:06:10,435
doesn't qualify for an "us."

745
01:06:15,607 --> 01:06:16,774
Do you even like me?

746
01:06:19,444 --> 01:06:24,199
You're oddly likable.
Or likable, which is odd.

747
01:06:38,796 --> 01:06:41,424
On the quiz tab.

748
01:06:58,983 --> 01:07:03,196
Naman, if you don't mind,
I have a suggestion.

749
01:07:05,323 --> 01:07:08,034
What can you possibly add
to this wonderful evening?

750
01:07:10,328 --> 01:07:14,707
Why don't you give Rita a call?
She was Plan A, after all.

751
01:07:18,253 --> 01:07:20,797
Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings!

752
01:07:21,923 --> 01:07:23,716
Bloody master.

753
01:07:34,602 --> 01:07:37,063
-Details?
-So...

754
01:07:37,146 --> 01:07:40,692
was Padma aka Paddy a virgin?
Rivers of blood, et cetera?

755
01:07:41,276 --> 01:07:44,404
-We didn't really...
-What? But you were with her all night.

756
01:07:44,487 --> 01:07:48,324
-Actually, we didn't do it.
-Why, bambino? No lead in the old pencil?

757
01:07:48,408 --> 01:07:50,493
No, you didn't let me finish.

758
01:07:50,577 --> 01:07:55,164
I was going to say, actually,
we didn't do it with a condom.

759
01:07:55,248 --> 01:07:56,708
Bareback.

760
01:07:58,251 --> 01:08:00,920
It slipped in smooth with no obstacles.

761
01:08:01,004 --> 01:08:03,172
So who popped it? The milkman?

762
01:08:03,256 --> 01:08:05,842
She said it broke
from excessive cycle riding.

763
01:08:05,925 --> 01:08:08,428
Not from excessive Ajay riding.

764
01:08:10,513 --> 01:08:12,515
I wonder what she'll tell her husband?

765
01:08:12,599 --> 01:08:15,560
I believe hymenoplasty
is an option these days.

766
01:08:16,394 --> 01:08:17,228
Hmm.

767
01:08:50,511 --> 01:08:54,849

Quick. Piss her out.

780
01:09:49,320 --> 01:09:51,572
-On the tracks?
-Where else?

781
01:11:15,531 --> 01:11:18,075
Listen, you can't keep
calling me like this.

782
01:11:18,159 --> 01:11:20,161
<i>My parents have been wondering.</i>

783
01:11:20,244 --> 01:11:23,164
<i>And you keep hanging up</i>
<i>when anybody else picks up.</i>

784
01:11:23,247 --> 01:11:26,083
That's because I want to talk only to you.

785
01:11:27,376 --> 01:11:28,461
Can I call you darling?

786
01:11:29,128 --> 01:11:30,713
<i>Darling Rita.</i>

787
01:11:31,672 --> 01:11:32,507
Hmm.

788
01:11:32,590 --> 01:11:34,509
You're looking beautiful.

789
01:11:34,592 --> 01:11:36,177
<i>-Hello?</i>
-Hello?

790
01:11:36,260 --> 01:11:37,553
Hello.

791
01:11:37,637 --> 01:11:39,764
You're looking beautiful.

792
01:11:41,557 --> 01:11:43,059
Hmm...

793
01:11:44,894 --> 01:11:46,395
How do you know?

794
01:11:47,146 --> 01:11:50,149
Because girls look beautiful
when they are angry.

795
01:11:50,233 --> 01:11:53,569
But I don't even know what you look like.

796
01:11:53,653 --> 01:11:56,447
In the fullness of time,
at the appropriate juncture.

797
01:11:56,531 --> 01:11:59,242
<i>- Hello?</i>
- At the appropriate juncture.

798
01:11:59,325 --> 01:12:00,785
- Hello?
<i>- I can't--</i>

799
01:12:00,868 --> 01:12:02,787
Please give me a clue.

800
01:12:02,870 --> 01:12:05,498
I wrote an article in
the St. James' College magazine last year.

801
01:12:06,415 --> 01:12:07,875
-Hello?
-Hello?

802
01:12:07,959 --> 01:12:11,379
<i>- What was it called?</i>
<i>- A Treatise.</i>

803
01:12:12,672 --> 01:12:15,174
Hello? Rita, hello?

804
01:12:16,551 --> 01:12:18,135
<i>A Treatise.</i>

805
01:12:19,053 --> 01:12:20,388
Hello?

806
01:12:23,432 --> 01:12:25,810
There you are. I looked everywhere.

807
01:12:25,893 --> 01:12:27,270
What do you want?

808
01:12:27,979 --> 01:12:32,108
-I just heard about Calcutta and--
-You've come to gloat about our defeat.

809
01:12:32,191 --> 01:12:35,486
You know I would never even dream
of anything like that.

810
01:12:35,570 --> 01:12:39,240
Good news, good news, the Lord
is coming, the savior is coming!

811
01:12:39,323 --> 01:12:44,287
-But I am already here.
-No, Lord Jesus Christ is coming.

812
01:12:44,370 --> 01:12:47,331
Austin Town football ground.
7 p.m. Wednesday.

813
01:12:47,415 --> 01:12:48,749
Is he coming in person?

814
01:12:59,051 --> 01:13:00,803
-This one?
-Yeah.

815
01:13:01,762 --> 01:13:03,598
Are you Naman?

816
01:13:11,689 --> 01:13:13,524
Are you Naman?

817
01:13:14,859 --> 01:13:17,528
<i>A Treatise</i> indeed.

818
01:13:18,529 --> 01:13:19,989
And do you know what?

819
01:13:20,072 --> 01:13:23,159
The stupid language of your stupid piece

820
01:13:23,242 --> 01:13:26,996
totally matched the stupid language
of your stupid letter.

821
01:13:27,079 --> 01:13:28,080
Stupid!

822
01:13:29,415 --> 01:13:32,627
So you're the one
who's been calling me all this while.

823
01:13:35,212 --> 01:13:38,925
Never ever call me again. Coward.

824
01:13:47,266 --> 01:13:49,602
At least she spoke to you face-to-face.

825
01:13:52,313 --> 01:13:55,483
<i>♪ My baby left me ♪</i>

826
01:13:55,566 --> 01:13:57,443
<i>♪ She was mad ♪</i>

827
01:13:58,444 --> 01:14:01,113
"Never ever call me again.

828
01:14:01,197 --> 01:14:03,699
-Coward."
-Fuckers.

829
01:14:03,783 --> 01:14:05,576
With friends like you, who needs enemas?

830
01:14:05,660 --> 01:14:07,662
This is what I told you in the beginning.

831
01:14:07,745 --> 01:14:10,456
Don't have anything to do with girls.
They are stupid.

832
01:14:10,539 --> 01:14:13,209
How about your fling with Padma
in Calcutta?

833
01:14:14,126 --> 01:14:17,380
The best thing to do is jerk her out.

834
01:14:17,463 --> 01:14:19,924
She'll disappear from your heart
as soon as you cum.

835
01:14:20,007 --> 01:14:21,884
Don't worry, she's probably
an untouchable anyway.

836
01:14:22,969 --> 01:14:25,721
To the victory of sex. Sex is truth.

837
01:14:25,805 --> 01:14:27,932
<i>In vino veritas.</i>

838
01:14:28,015 --> 01:14:30,434
There's truth in alcohol, too.

839
01:14:30,935 --> 01:14:33,229
Forgive me, I lied to you in Calcutta.

840
01:14:33,896 --> 01:14:38,442
At least you got laid, ra.
Padma ain't no Sylvia Kristel, but...

841
01:14:38,526 --> 01:14:39,568
That night after the quiz,

842
01:14:39,652 --> 01:14:42,655
her boyfriend had followed her to Calcutta
to get time alone with her.

843
01:14:42,738 --> 01:14:46,158
Miss Augusta let her go with me
because Bernie told her we were harmless.

844
01:14:46,742 --> 01:14:49,996
I took her to her boyfriend's hotel
and waited while she went upstairs.

845
01:14:50,830 --> 01:14:53,082
She took hours and hours to come back.

846
01:14:53,165 --> 01:14:55,793
--At least somebody got laid!

847
01:15:02,425 --> 01:15:06,470
Hey. Why chase after Nainas and Ritas
when you have her?

848
01:15:06,554 --> 01:15:08,514
-I wouldn't go there.
-I would.

849
01:15:08,597 --> 01:15:12,977
So what if she's got pimples.
Nice tits, nice arse.

850
01:15:13,060 --> 01:15:15,604
Cover the face, fire the base.

851
01:15:17,565 --> 01:15:21,152
I know I'm not invited here,
but Rita told me what she said to you--

852
01:15:21,235 --> 01:15:24,572
For a change, you aren't gloating.
Take a pew.

853
01:15:29,618 --> 01:15:31,704
<i>♪ Fuck you! ♪</i>

854
01:15:31,787 --> 01:15:34,123
<i>♪ I'll be fine ♪</i>

855
01:15:40,463 --> 01:15:43,841
I want green salad.

856
01:15:43,924 --> 01:15:48,763
-Sorry, sir, kitchen is closed.
-But I want green salad.

857
01:15:54,310 --> 01:15:58,105
- I think you should go home now.
- I want green salad.

858
01:15:58,189 --> 01:16:00,900
I want revenge. Bloody leper Rita.

859
01:16:02,735 --> 01:16:04,528
You'll get your revenge, baba.

860
01:16:04,612 --> 01:16:07,615
"If you prick us, do we not bleed?

861
01:16:07,698 --> 01:16:10,284
If you tickle us, do we not laugh?"

862
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:12,078
"If you poison us, do we not die?"

863
01:16:12,161 --> 01:16:15,790
"If you wrong us, shall we not revenge?"

864
01:16:15,873 --> 01:16:17,249
Shakespeare.

865
01:16:19,043 --> 01:16:21,170
- I want...
- Randy!

866
01:16:21,253 --> 01:16:22,671
...green salad.

867
01:16:22,755 --> 01:16:25,716
- Come down. Come down now.
- Please, what are you doing?

868
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:27,635
But I want green fucking salad.

869
01:16:27,718 --> 01:16:29,595
Randy, please just come down.
Please.

870
01:16:30,596 --> 01:16:33,682
No green. No women.

871
01:16:35,059 --> 01:16:36,602
No salad.

872
01:16:39,021 --> 01:16:40,397
What's the point in living?

873
01:16:44,318 --> 01:16:46,612
Come down, ra.
Don't make a scene here.

874
01:16:46,695 --> 01:16:48,531
- Please, Randy.
- Waiter, salad, now.

875
01:16:48,614 --> 01:16:53,410
- It's coming.
- This way. Come down, please. Careful.

876
01:16:55,704 --> 01:16:57,790
There's your green salad.

877
01:17:20,688 --> 01:17:24,400
Precision... is the key.

878
01:17:29,864 --> 01:17:33,325
God, what have I created?

879
01:17:44,336 --> 01:17:47,923
Watch and learn.
The revenge of the Brahman.

880
01:18:05,149 --> 01:18:06,817
Where to now?

881
01:18:07,985 --> 01:18:10,613
You want to see something
you've never seen before?

882
01:18:11,447 --> 01:18:14,909
Romantic, soft, bouncy.

883
01:18:16,202 --> 01:18:18,495
I would love to!

884
01:18:23,250 --> 01:18:26,212
Joseph! Joseph!

885
01:18:26,295 --> 01:18:30,216
<i>Yaarappa?</i> Sir, you so late.

886
01:18:30,299 --> 01:18:32,843
Leave the light on,<i> maado,</i>
and go back to bed, understand?

887
01:18:42,978 --> 01:18:45,439
-Wow.
-Impressive.

888
01:18:45,522 --> 01:18:48,400
My father imports these machines
from Austria.

889
01:18:48,817 --> 01:18:49,860
Really?

890
01:19:30,401 --> 01:19:34,488
For madam, the finest
rubberized coir latex

891
01:19:34,571 --> 01:19:38,158
featuring a fabulous jute hessian
quilted cloth.

892
01:19:39,827 --> 01:19:46,667
Or perhaps this one. This one sinks
to make perfect contours for your body.

893
01:19:46,750 --> 01:19:51,880
Or should I say...
contours for your perfect body?

894
01:20:03,350 --> 01:20:05,185
I have a surprise for you.

895
01:20:20,951 --> 01:20:23,579
A Brahman cannot sip
from the same bottle as you.

896
01:20:24,663 --> 01:20:27,333
Our lips are going to touch anyway.

897
01:20:27,416 --> 01:20:30,586
Besides, I'm a Brahman, too.

898
01:20:54,777 --> 01:20:56,570
Ow! Naman!

899
01:20:58,072 --> 01:21:00,282
Ouch. What are you thinking?

900
01:21:02,034 --> 01:21:03,410
Sorry.

901
01:21:04,828 --> 01:21:06,705
How bad is it?

902
01:21:17,007 --> 01:21:18,509
Ash?

903
01:21:21,011 --> 01:21:22,930
Cover the face.

904
01:21:25,391 --> 01:21:27,309
Fire the base.

905
01:22:07,558 --> 01:22:10,310
I've waited so long for this, Naman.

906
01:22:32,666 --> 01:22:34,376
Where are you going, bastard?

907
01:22:51,560 --> 01:22:55,564
Sorry for you, Naman. Very sorry.

908
01:22:56,565 --> 01:23:01,987
I came here tonight because I loved you,
despite the constant mocking and...

909
01:23:02,529 --> 01:23:05,449
underneath I thought
that there was some affection for me.

910
01:23:06,283 --> 01:23:08,577
I was so wrong.

911
01:23:08,660 --> 01:23:12,581
Your arrogance is just a front
for your ugliness.

912
01:23:13,290 --> 01:23:15,709
Yes, Naman, you're ugly.

913
01:23:22,758 --> 01:23:26,553
Rita was right.
You're nothing but a coward.

914
01:23:27,804 --> 01:23:31,767
You think because you have all the answers
you're so clever. You don't.

915
01:23:32,434 --> 01:23:34,102
And you're not.

916
01:23:34,937 --> 01:23:37,940
Once your cheerleader friends
grow up and see through you,

917
01:23:38,023 --> 01:23:42,903
you're going to be left all alone
for the rest of your miserable life.

918
01:24:42,087 --> 01:24:45,799
What are you waiting for? Fuck off.

919
01:24:48,385 --> 01:24:50,929
-It's a long walk back.
-I said, fuck off.

920
01:25:46,151 --> 01:25:48,403
-Naman, I--
-The Iriya Samiti,

921
01:25:48,487 --> 01:25:51,073
the regulation of walking
in Jain scriptures,

922
01:25:51,156 --> 01:25:54,451
it states that one should walk
looking carefully six feet distance ahead.

923
01:25:54,534 --> 01:25:57,746
So as not to cause the pain or death
of any living being.

924
01:25:57,829 --> 01:25:59,790
"I like long walks.

925
01:26:00,749 --> 01:26:03,710
Especially when they're taken
by people who annoy me."

926
01:26:08,340 --> 01:26:10,133
Noël Coward.

927
01:26:15,972 --> 01:26:18,642
-Guess what.
-Hyderabad?

928
01:26:18,725 --> 01:26:22,437
I was coming back on a coach,
luxury class, of course.

929
01:26:22,521 --> 01:26:25,857
This sex bomb was in the seat next to me.

930
01:26:25,941 --> 01:26:27,693
Male or female?

931
01:26:29,194 --> 01:26:33,198
She fell asleep with her head
on my shoulders so I fiddled it.

932
01:26:34,324 --> 01:26:36,535
She pretended to stay asleep.

933
01:26:37,285 --> 01:26:39,788
So I stuck a finger in her pussy...

934
01:26:40,914 --> 01:26:43,709
...and I smelled it.

935
01:26:43,792 --> 01:26:45,335
Did it smell of fish?

936
01:26:45,419 --> 01:26:49,214
It was heavenly, ra, like your
grandmom's freshly cooked biryani.

937
01:26:49,297 --> 01:26:52,509
-Veg or non-veg?
-Did you fuck her?

938
01:27:02,310 --> 01:27:04,980
- Welcome, Bangalore.

939
01:27:05,063 --> 01:27:09,943
Welcome to the finals of the
Annual Sagaya Mary Memorial Quiz.

940
01:27:11,653 --> 01:27:15,866
Now, before we begin this event,
let me inform you about

941
01:27:15,949 --> 01:27:22,372
certain shameful shenanigans at the
Quiz Superstars event held in Calcutta.

942
01:27:22,456 --> 01:27:26,168
Upset at being beaten by a superior team,

943
01:27:26,251 --> 01:27:32,257
the Bangalore team abused our hospitality
and ran up a bill of 4,000 rupees,

944
01:27:32,340 --> 01:27:36,595
including two bottles of single malt.

945
01:27:40,724 --> 01:27:43,185
So this is for you, Naman Bala.

946
01:27:43,268 --> 01:27:49,941
You and your entire team
are henceforth banned from this quiz.

947
01:27:50,692 --> 01:27:55,989
If I had my way, from every other quiz.

948
01:27:56,990 --> 01:28:01,578
Please leave the hall. Now!

949
01:28:04,080 --> 01:28:05,707
Now.

950
01:28:05,791 --> 01:28:09,795
Will the other finalists
please come up on stage?

951
01:28:12,339 --> 01:28:14,049
What the hell are you doing, Naman?

952
01:28:15,050 --> 01:28:18,220
If this is your apology,
then you're too late for it, trust me.

953
01:28:20,680 --> 01:28:22,349
Give him a chance, man.

954
01:28:24,184 --> 01:28:26,228
There is a word...

955
01:28:28,146 --> 01:28:32,859
There is a word in the English language,
derived from the Latin, of course,

956
01:28:32,943 --> 01:28:36,738
that is an expression of contrition.

957
01:28:39,241 --> 01:28:40,700
I have committed an offense.

958
01:28:41,993 --> 01:28:46,998
And perception of that offense
can compound over time...

959
01:28:47,999 --> 01:28:49,835
otherwise known as compounding remorse.

960
01:28:51,086 --> 01:28:54,422
What I am doing here is to compunctulate.

961
01:28:55,632 --> 01:28:58,677
No, to recompunctulate.

962
01:29:13,650 --> 01:29:16,027
-I have decided.
-What?

963
01:29:16,111 --> 01:29:18,446
I'll marry Ash
and make an honest woman out of her.

964
01:29:18,530 --> 01:29:20,448
Where did that come from?

965
01:29:20,532 --> 01:29:22,909
If you're looking for context,
young apprentice,

966
01:29:22,993 --> 01:29:26,413
the events of the last few days
must not have escaped your notice.

967
01:29:26,496 --> 01:29:27,914
She is Brahman.

968
01:29:28,957 --> 01:29:32,210
While Ramu here gets ready to get
deflowered by a bull,

969
01:29:32,294 --> 01:29:37,048
unless he's already lost his hymen to
a milkman or other assorted menial help.

970
01:29:37,132 --> 01:29:40,760
It was a bull... that broke my foot.

971
01:29:45,515 --> 01:29:46,808
Where was I?

972
01:29:46,891 --> 01:29:48,727
Ramu was getting fucked.

973
01:29:49,561 --> 01:29:53,982
No, I was in Ash, but I will be once
we are joined together in holy matrimony.

974
01:29:54,065 --> 01:29:55,567
Hi, honchos.
