1
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:09,611
<i>Last week China conducted</i>
<i>one more nuclear test.</i>

2
00:04:10,051 --> 00:04:12,733
<i>This was the 43rd nuclear test</i>
<i>conducted by the Chinese.</i>

3
00:04:12,854 --> 00:04:16,097
<i>It is believed that</i>
<i>this atom bomb is powerful</i>

4
00:04:16,218 --> 00:04:20,422
<i>enough to destroy</i>
<i>any major cities in India.</i>

5
00:04:22,343 --> 00:04:24,826
{\an8}Our neighboring country
has conducted yet another test.

6
00:04:25,026 --> 00:04:26,587
Now it is our turn
to give a befitting reply.

7
00:04:26,788 --> 00:04:30,352
You tell me when and how.

8
00:04:30,752 --> 00:04:33,234
I'll personally submit a report
to the Prime Minister.

9
00:04:33,354 --> 00:04:36,517
Sir, we need to be very
careful with our words.

10
00:04:36,677 --> 00:04:39,800
In my opinion, let's not
send our badminton team this year

11
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:42,162
to any tournament China is participating.

12
00:04:42,283 --> 00:04:44,605
Sir. Let's ban Chinese food.

13
00:04:44,805 --> 00:04:48,368
Let’s refuse to export
Alphonso mangoes to China this year.

14
00:04:48,569 --> 00:04:50,411
Are momos originally from China?

15
00:04:50,492 --> 00:04:51,572
I am fond of them.

16
00:04:52,452 --> 00:04:54,255
We should also conduct a nuclear test.

17
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,455
Huh?

18
00:05:00,861 --> 00:05:01,902
Who are you?

19
00:05:02,222 --> 00:05:03,183
Ashwat Raina, sir.

20
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:05,305
Which department are you from?

21
00:05:07,068 --> 00:05:08,068
That's fine.

22
00:05:09,028 --> 00:05:11,591
You can't just dish out
your opinions here.

23
00:05:11,991 --> 00:05:13,233
Instead, you listen to us, mister.

24
00:05:13,633 --> 00:05:16,516
Here we are, discussing
and criticizing their moves

25
00:05:16,595 --> 00:05:18,398
and you've come up with
something completely irrelevant.

26
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:21,161
This is the time for action,
not criticisms.

27
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,361
What do you mean?

28
00:05:22,601 --> 00:05:24,204
Should we also carry out an explosion?

29
00:05:32,411 --> 00:05:35,054
If we have an atom bomb,
there will be peace in the country.

30
00:05:35,134 --> 00:05:37,377
Your research is weak, Mr. Raina.

31
00:05:37,457 --> 00:05:40,940
We possess an atom bomb since 1974.

32
00:05:41,821 --> 00:05:43,782
That was a peaceful nuclear explosion.

33
00:05:44,984 --> 00:05:46,465
There is a car in the garage.

34
00:05:46,785 --> 00:05:49,468
How do we find out
whether we can still drive it?

35
00:05:49,628 --> 00:05:51,990
You don’t have to worry about the car.

36
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,872
Let him speak, Tripathi

37
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:55,954
while we wait for our tea.

38
00:05:57,076 --> 00:05:58,476
Go on, son.

39
00:06:06,164 --> 00:06:08,487
We're having a hush-hush conversation.

40
00:06:09,247 --> 00:06:10,129
Why?

41
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:15,333
When will India be respected
by the rest of the world?

42
00:06:16,454 --> 00:06:17,856
Take the USA for instance.

43
00:06:18,537 --> 00:06:21,059
They have tested more than
a thousand atom bombs.

44
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:25,422
On land, under the water and in the sky.

45
00:06:25,904 --> 00:06:28,546
Today, they are a superpower.

46
00:06:28,986 --> 00:06:30,908
Following in their footsteps is China.

47
00:06:31,549 --> 00:06:33,151
So far, they've conducted 43 tests

48
00:06:33,311 --> 00:06:36,554
and are supplying
atom bombs to Pakistan.

49
00:06:37,515 --> 00:06:39,877
An existential crisis looms
on the horizon

50
00:06:40,198 --> 00:06:42,639
while we sit and criticize in fear.

51
00:06:46,764 --> 00:06:48,605
Don't chant peace and cower in fear.

52
00:06:49,406 --> 00:06:50,608
Take action and profess peace.

53
00:06:56,013 --> 00:06:58,615
-There, our tea has arrived.
-Snacks as well.

54
00:06:58,695 --> 00:07:00,497
Sir, I have the entire plan ready
on this floppy disk.

55
00:07:00,618 --> 00:07:02,739
We can't let the Americans know
about this test.

56
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,341
Else they might attack us.

57
00:07:04,421 --> 00:07:05,582
Their satellites
are always watching us...

58
00:07:05,702 --> 00:07:07,384
Why don’t you give me the floppy disk?

59
00:07:07,504 --> 00:07:08,905
I'll handle this.
Give it to me.

60
00:07:10,067 --> 00:07:11,067
Give it to me.

61
00:07:33,929 --> 00:07:34,770
Listen.

62
00:07:35,571 --> 00:07:37,293
-What did you say your name was?
-Ashwat.

63
00:07:37,413 --> 00:07:38,293
Yes.

64
00:07:39,255 --> 00:07:41,377
Avoid giving speeches
when you talk about these things.

65
00:07:41,737 --> 00:07:44,180
These things need to be dealt sensitively.

66
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:48,023
Why don’t you prepare a report on this?

67
00:07:49,465 --> 00:07:51,026
-It will be ready by tomorrow.
-Hmm.

68
00:07:51,586 --> 00:07:53,909
And yes, it has to be brief.

69
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:58,233
The Prime Minister doesn't
have the time to read lengthy reports.

70
00:07:58,873 --> 00:08:00,396
Keep it short and simple

71
00:08:00,636 --> 00:08:02,758
and I’ll fix up your
next meeting with him.

72
00:08:23,538 --> 00:08:24,698
You carry on.

73
00:08:24,859 --> 00:08:27,021
Ashwat, come here.

74
00:08:27,221 --> 00:08:28,743
This boy tires me out!

75
00:08:29,343 --> 00:08:30,664
What's going on?

76
00:08:31,145 --> 00:08:32,867
You seem to be very happy today.

77
00:08:33,107 --> 00:08:34,228
Are you all right?

78
00:08:34,308 --> 00:08:35,509
Come on,
I am not serious all the time.

79
00:08:35,629 --> 00:08:36,831
Yes, you are!

80
00:08:37,271 --> 00:08:38,392
Always!

81
00:08:38,712 --> 00:08:41,235
I deserve a medal,
just like your father.

82
00:08:41,475 --> 00:08:44,838
For being so happy in spite of
having such a serious husband.

83
00:08:45,319 --> 00:08:46,480
I think I will finally

84
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,003
be able to do something
for our country, just like dad.

85
00:08:49,803 --> 00:08:51,604
You know, I might have a meeting with
the Prime Minister.

86
00:09:01,054 --> 00:09:03,857
You know, he wanted me
to join the army like he did.

87
00:09:04,937 --> 00:09:09,342
Ashwat, you don't need to don a uniform
to become a hero. Your attitude is enough.

88
00:09:10,103 --> 00:09:14,908
And I am sure the Prime Minister will
definitely be impressed with you.

89
00:09:15,869 --> 00:09:18,151
Now will you tell me
what this meeting is about?

90
00:09:18,231 --> 00:09:19,192
I will.

91
00:09:19,953 --> 00:09:20,953
After the meeting.

92
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:35,007
Come on, Ashwat! Do you want
the Prime Minister to wait?

93
00:09:35,688 --> 00:09:37,409
I had to make it brief,
there is so much information.

94
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:39,171
-It had to be...
-Fine. Give me the file.

95
00:09:39,892 --> 00:09:40,933
Sir, may I go with you?

96
00:09:41,053 --> 00:09:41,974
Where?

97
00:09:43,456 --> 00:09:45,417
Don’t worry. I will handle this.
Sit over there.

98
00:10:04,396 --> 00:10:09,041
You have no idea how useful
this nuclear plan is for our country.

99
00:10:09,441 --> 00:10:11,522
Mr. Yadav has come up
with a brilliant idea.

100
00:10:11,964 --> 00:10:15,085
Once we conduct this test,
our Chinese neighbors will know.

101
00:10:15,487 --> 00:10:18,169
Don't chant peace and cower in fear.
Take action and profess peace.

102
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:19,931
That's great, sir.

103
00:11:01,732 --> 00:11:04,253
<i>Last morning,</i>
<i>American satellites got wind</i>

104
00:11:04,334 --> 00:11:06,816
<i>of India's nuclear test.</i>

105
00:11:07,056 --> 00:11:09,419
<i>After a strict warning</i>
<i>from President Clinton</i>

106
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,340
<i>the nuclear project</i>
<i>has been halted.</i>

107
00:11:19,549 --> 00:11:21,951
<i>America has warned India</i>

108
00:11:22,031 --> 00:11:28,037
<i>of military action at their nuclear sites</i>
<i>if they don’t stop immediately.</i>

109
00:11:28,117 --> 00:11:31,841
<i>Pakistan has also raised</i>
<i>strong objections in this matter.</i>

110
00:11:42,051 --> 00:11:44,934
Let me make it clear, we were
conducting routine checks in Pokhran

111
00:11:45,013 --> 00:11:46,975
and not preparing for any tests.

112
00:11:47,095 --> 00:11:49,978
This is a case of misunderstanding.

113
00:11:50,099 --> 00:11:53,622
We will soon find out
who is behind this hullabaloo.

114
00:11:53,741 --> 00:11:56,064
I have nothing to do with
the execution of this mission.

115
00:11:56,665 --> 00:11:59,187
Mr. Yadav, you didn’t even
let me meet the Prime Minister.

116
00:11:59,267 --> 00:12:00,669
Aren’t you glad I didn’t?

117
00:12:01,029 --> 00:12:02,710
Your plan was terribly flawed.

118
00:12:03,231 --> 00:12:05,594
You were so sure of it at the time.

119
00:12:05,914 --> 00:12:07,155
Look what happened!

120
00:12:07,715 --> 00:12:10,638
You embarrassed our country
in front of the whole world.

121
00:12:10,718 --> 00:12:12,401
Did anyone even pay
attention to my plan?

122
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,841
You cannot summarize
so much information

123
00:12:13,921 --> 00:12:15,483
on such a huge project,
in two pages.

124
00:12:15,644 --> 00:12:17,084
The mission was completed without me.

125
00:12:17,164 --> 00:12:19,006
Now that it has failed,
I am being held responsible.

126
00:12:19,087 --> 00:12:22,570
Since you knew all this,
why didn’t you give us the full details?

127
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:24,011
Sir, I gave you the floppy disk.

128
00:12:24,091 --> 00:12:25,493
It's still lying around.

129
00:12:25,573 --> 00:12:26,534
Had you seen it...

130
00:12:26,613 --> 00:12:29,336
You are suspended
with immediate effect.

131
00:12:46,193 --> 00:12:50,437
<i>I haven’t even woken up</i>

132
00:12:50,516 --> 00:12:54,040
<i>Why is it dawn already?</i>

133
00:13:03,209 --> 00:13:07,333
<i>Before I could even begin</i>

134
00:13:07,413 --> 00:13:11,338
<i>It's all over</i>

135
00:13:11,618 --> 00:13:14,621
<i>My coveted dream</i>

136
00:13:17,704 --> 00:13:20,185
<i>Is now lost forever</i>

137
00:13:21,188 --> 00:13:24,911
<i>Ashwat should've appealed against</i>
<i>his suspension order.</i>

138
00:13:25,311 --> 00:13:27,193
I gave you Mr. Sharma's number, Sushma.

139
00:13:27,272 --> 00:13:29,355
Please speak softly, he might hear you.

140
00:13:29,715 --> 00:13:33,558
You know, he doesn’t
like to talk about his work.

141
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:35,281
Even I don’t know what happened.

142
00:13:35,841 --> 00:13:39,244
Still, it has already been two months.

143
00:13:39,724 --> 00:13:41,567
Why doesn’t Ashwat look for another job?

144
00:13:41,647 --> 00:13:43,729
He has done his engineering from IIT!

145
00:13:43,808 --> 00:13:46,131
I still have my job
at the observatory.

146
00:13:46,212 --> 00:13:49,374
Mussoorie will be a
change of scene for Ashwat.

147
00:13:49,774 --> 00:13:51,016
He has a different ambition.

148
00:13:51,097 --> 00:13:52,177
He wants to do something
for his country.

149
00:13:52,257 --> 00:13:54,860
What country?
The country has abandoned him.

150
00:13:54,939 --> 00:13:57,903
If you do night shifts,
how will you take care of Prahlad?

151
00:13:58,063 --> 00:13:59,624
Papa, please speak softly.

152
00:14:02,867 --> 00:14:04,068
Don’t worry.

153
00:14:07,071 --> 00:14:11,356
<i>So precious were those dreams</i>

154
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:16,000
<i>So close to my heart</i>

155
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,283
<i>I can't reminisce</i>

156
00:14:19,364 --> 00:14:24,169
<i>So precious were those memories</i>

157
00:14:24,689 --> 00:14:28,853
<i>Tried so hard to hold on to them</i>

158
00:14:28,932 --> 00:14:32,536
<i>Tried so hard to hold on to them</i>

159
00:14:32,616 --> 00:14:36,059
<i>But my dream, my coveted dream</i>

160
00:14:39,022 --> 00:14:42,106
<i>Is now lost forever</i>

161
00:14:48,592 --> 00:14:51,755
<i>My dream, my coveted dream</i>

162
00:14:52,796 --> 00:14:56,559
<i>My dream, my coveted dream</i>

163
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:02,645
<i>My coveted dream is lost forever</i>

164
00:15:08,691 --> 00:15:11,134
<i>Is lost forever</i>

165
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:35,198
<i>Hi, son. Had your milk?</i>

166
00:15:35,277 --> 00:15:36,398
Not tonight.

167
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,040
You’ll have to a drink some milk.

168
00:15:39,601 --> 00:15:41,083
Have you finished your science project?

169
00:15:41,163 --> 00:15:42,244
You have to submit it tomorrow.

170
00:15:42,323 --> 00:15:43,164
<i>Where is your dad?</i>

171
00:15:43,245 --> 00:15:44,126
He's teaching.

172
00:15:44,967 --> 00:15:45,808
It's late, isn't it?

173
00:15:46,568 --> 00:15:48,771
Sir, excuse me, it's 8 already.

174
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:50,051
So?

175
00:15:50,131 --> 00:15:51,213
I want to go home.

176
00:15:51,413 --> 00:15:53,574
Wasn’t our class
supposed to be till 6 p.m?

177
00:15:54,336 --> 00:15:56,378
When you prepare for civil service exams,

178
00:15:57,059 --> 00:15:58,260
keep an eye on the syllabus,
not on the clock.

179
00:15:59,941 --> 00:16:02,983
This is the second time
you're revising the syllabus.

180
00:16:03,064 --> 00:16:05,066
Papa, my science project.

181
00:16:05,186 --> 00:16:07,429
Mummy said you'd help me with it.

182
00:16:08,429 --> 00:16:09,430
Sit down.

183
00:16:10,232 --> 00:16:11,793
Not now, my class is still on.

184
00:16:11,912 --> 00:16:13,554
So when will you help me?

185
00:16:13,675 --> 00:16:14,996
I need to go sleep.

186
00:16:15,076 --> 00:16:16,276
Go ahead, I'll see you later.

187
00:16:16,797 --> 00:16:19,600
Okay, guys,
only six to seven lectures more.

188
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,483
If you study hard,
you'll ace the exams.

189
00:16:23,644 --> 00:16:25,085
Who cares about acing the exams?

190
00:16:25,206 --> 00:16:26,968
We just want a government job.

191
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:31,372
A huge house and a car with a red beacon
will be more than enough.

192
00:16:32,693 --> 00:16:33,574
This...

193
00:16:34,455 --> 00:16:36,696
This attitude of your generation...

194
00:16:37,618 --> 00:16:39,379
Do you even know
what being a civil servant means?

195
00:16:45,586 --> 00:16:46,827
If you can't do that...

196
00:16:48,108 --> 00:16:49,950
don’t waste the position.

197
00:17:04,644 --> 00:17:06,767
Hey, you haven’t put on your shoes yet!

198
00:17:06,926 --> 00:17:08,247
Go get them, you will be late.

199
00:17:08,368 --> 00:17:09,168
Run!

200
00:17:09,888 --> 00:17:11,490
Did you put all your books in the bag?

201
00:17:13,413 --> 00:17:16,816
Prahlad.
Where's your science project?

202
00:17:16,936 --> 00:17:19,218
I fell asleep by
the time Papa returned.

203
00:17:24,744 --> 00:17:26,586
Couldn’t you help him a little bit?

204
00:17:26,946 --> 00:17:27,786
Huh?

205
00:17:27,867 --> 00:17:29,869
My class went on till late, Sushma.

206
00:17:30,228 --> 00:17:31,670
Anyway, he's a big boy now.

207
00:17:31,991 --> 00:17:33,952
He can do his work. Right?

208
00:17:34,032 --> 00:17:35,874
He does everything on his own, Ashwat.

209
00:17:36,315 --> 00:17:38,597
He is very mature and
independent for his age.

210
00:17:38,677 --> 00:17:40,679
He's so cooperative.

211
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,801
Can't you make some time for him?

212
00:17:42,881 --> 00:17:43,722
I am, Sushma.

213
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:52,731
Go and make your bed.

214
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:53,812
Already done.

215
00:17:53,892 --> 00:17:54,813
Done already?

216
00:17:55,813 --> 00:17:58,136
Then go and fill this water bottle.

217
00:18:05,022 --> 00:18:06,945
How long will this go on, Ashwat?

218
00:18:07,185 --> 00:18:10,669
Do you know that they charge
tuition fees by the hour now?

219
00:18:10,748 --> 00:18:13,831
And your class go on for
over five hours instead of two.

220
00:18:13,952 --> 00:18:16,635
Civil examinations are tough.
I need to give my students time.

221
00:18:16,754 --> 00:18:17,795
And Prahlad?

222
00:18:18,476 --> 00:18:20,678
Who will be responsible
for his studies?

223
00:18:21,239 --> 00:18:25,082
Is his father capable of paying
for his school fees, extra classes

224
00:18:25,202 --> 00:18:28,525
IIT entrance exams
and IAS preparations?

225
00:18:28,606 --> 00:18:29,807
He's only nine years old, Sushma.

226
00:18:34,971 --> 00:18:36,254
I don’t believe this.

227
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:40,697
When it comes to his projects,
you say he is old enough.

228
00:18:40,978 --> 00:18:42,660
And when it comes to
your responsibilities...

229
00:18:42,779 --> 00:18:44,261
You say, "We have time!"

230
00:18:46,063 --> 00:18:47,984
Our savings are almost over.

231
00:18:48,345 --> 00:18:51,507
When will you take up a proper job
and stop these part-time tuitions?

232
00:18:52,068 --> 00:18:53,030
Come here.

233
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:55,031
Come here!

234
00:18:56,553 --> 00:18:58,074
I have no idea what this burden is

235
00:18:58,154 --> 00:19:00,276
that you're carrying
for the last three years.

236
00:19:01,837 --> 00:19:04,040
It hasn't just affected you,
but us as well.

237
00:19:05,161 --> 00:19:07,323
Understand your responsibilities, Ashwat.

238
00:19:08,604 --> 00:19:10,086
Take care of your family...

239
00:19:10,887 --> 00:19:12,569
and I'll give you a medal for it.

240
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:16,132
Come on, we are getting late.

241
00:19:20,176 --> 00:19:22,337
You got yelled at because of me.

242
00:19:22,418 --> 00:19:23,219
Okay.

243
00:19:40,556 --> 00:19:42,076
<i>Darkness will fade away</i>

244
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:44,599
<i>The sun will shine</i>

245
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,681
{\an8}<i>and the lotus shall bloom.</i>

246
00:19:47,443 --> 00:19:48,403
{\an8}<i>Thank you very much.</i>

247
00:19:48,523 --> 00:19:52,927
<i>India's hopes rise as Mr. Atal Bihari</i>
<i>Vajpayee becomes the Prime Minister.</i>

248
00:19:53,008 --> 00:19:54,889
<i>I do swear in the name of God</i>

249
00:19:55,811 --> 00:20:00,815
<i>that I will not directly or</i>
<i>indirectly communicate or reveal to</i>

250
00:20:01,615 --> 00:20:06,260
<i>any person or persons any matter which</i>
<i>shall be brought under my consideration.</i>

251
00:20:06,341 --> 00:20:09,184
<i>The Vajpayee Government</i>
<i>with its cabinet of ministers</i>

252
00:20:09,263 --> 00:20:12,026
<i>might be the answer to the problems</i>
<i>of political instability</i>

253
00:20:12,106 --> 00:20:14,428
<i>that the country has been</i>
<i>facing for the last three years.</i>

254
00:20:36,891 --> 00:20:38,892
All those who are carrying bouquets,
please leave the room.

255
00:20:39,813 --> 00:20:42,897
In the time it has taken me
to reach my office from the car,

256
00:20:43,297 --> 00:20:47,020
Pakistan's newly
launched Ghauri missile

257
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:50,303
would've destroyed
the entire city of New Delhi.

258
00:20:51,825 --> 00:20:56,029
While Pakistan and China continued with
their numerous tests,

259
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:57,670
we tried to conduct one in 1995

260
00:20:58,712 --> 00:20:59,792
which failed, by the way.

261
00:21:00,072 --> 00:21:01,193
Does anyone remember?

262
00:21:03,196 --> 00:21:06,079
Whoever doesn't remember, get out!

263
00:21:08,882 --> 00:21:10,203
Mr. Tripathi, where are you going?

264
00:21:10,363 --> 00:21:11,444
Well, I...

265
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:19,892
You were a part of that committee, right?

266
00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:23,015
Let's start with you.

267
00:21:33,906 --> 00:21:35,387
How are you ready so early today?

268
00:21:35,467 --> 00:21:37,469
Papa helped me with
all my homework as well.

269
00:21:37,548 --> 00:21:38,429
Really?

270
00:21:43,435 --> 00:21:44,956
Mummy and Papa are coming home tonight.

271
00:21:45,036 --> 00:21:46,718
Don’t forget to receive them
at the station.

272
00:21:49,161 --> 00:21:51,362
I have received a job offer
from Delhi Open University.

273
00:21:51,722 --> 00:21:53,245
For the Engineering Department.

274
00:21:53,805 --> 00:21:55,407
They have called me
for an interview day after tomorrow.

275
00:21:56,528 --> 00:21:57,488
I will go and meet them.

276
00:21:58,248 --> 00:21:59,451
Have some yogurt and sugar.

277
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,661
Uttar Pradesh Transport

278
00:22:16,186 --> 00:22:17,588
Gorkha School, Dehradun Cantonment

279
00:22:31,561 --> 00:22:33,003
-Ashwat Raina?
-Yes.

280
00:22:33,323 --> 00:22:34,244
Please come.

281
00:22:47,857 --> 00:22:48,778
You are...

282
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:51,580
Himanshu Shukla.

283
00:22:57,106 --> 00:22:59,669
This interview is
regarding your work in 1995.

284
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:02,111
I don’t want to talk about it.

285
00:23:02,552 --> 00:23:04,193
You needed my permission to get in,

286
00:23:04,273 --> 00:23:05,755
you need the same to go out.

287
00:23:09,078 --> 00:23:10,559
How did your plan fail?

288
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,842
The plan that failed was not mine.

289
00:23:13,122 --> 00:23:15,164
You should have done your homework.

290
00:23:15,605 --> 00:23:17,926
Anyway, the floppy disk
has all the details.

291
00:23:18,006 --> 00:23:19,729
All the files on the disk were coded.

292
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:22,411
No one could crack the code
or no one bothered to?

293
00:23:22,531 --> 00:23:24,012
This is an official enquiry.

294
00:23:24,212 --> 00:23:26,215
Please answer my questions.

295
00:23:35,503 --> 00:23:37,145
You can't hold me responsible now.

296
00:23:37,305 --> 00:23:40,829
What happened in 1995
was a failure for our country.

297
00:23:46,954 --> 00:23:48,677
I've left all this behind me.

298
00:23:49,957 --> 00:23:54,242
Anyway, your system does not appreciate
talent that I have.

299
00:23:56,564 --> 00:23:58,567
Aren’t you Ajitabh Raina's son?

300
00:24:03,411 --> 00:24:07,014
He was awarded a
bravery medal in that war.

301
00:24:17,504 --> 00:24:19,066
If he were here instead of you,

302
00:24:19,146 --> 00:24:21,589
he would have put his country first.

303
00:24:25,272 --> 00:24:26,913
The files on this floppy can't be opened.

304
00:24:28,395 --> 00:24:29,236
You can keep it.

305
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:45,091
There are two parts to this plan.

306
00:24:45,492 --> 00:24:48,255
First are the scientists and
the engineers who build the bomb.

307
00:24:48,415 --> 00:24:51,858
Secondly, we have the army
who install these bombs.

308
00:24:52,458 --> 00:24:55,782
And then, there was the third part,
the most important one

309
00:24:56,022 --> 00:24:57,583
which nobody paid attention to.

310
00:25:00,226 --> 00:25:03,669
We were caught because
the Pokhran range is open and spread out.

311
00:25:03,989 --> 00:25:05,912
All the preparations were made
in broad daylight.

312
00:25:06,152 --> 00:25:09,274
Because Mr. Yadav and his team
had not read my whole plan.

313
00:25:09,715 --> 00:25:11,117
No one bothered to open the files

314
00:25:11,197 --> 00:25:12,918
and I wasn’t given a chance
to explain the details.

315
00:25:13,158 --> 00:25:14,720
What was so important?

316
00:25:17,684 --> 00:25:21,246
The American Lacrosse satellites
keep a watch on us all the time.

317
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:28,894
<i>These Lacrosse satellites also helped</i>
<i>America immensely during the Gulf War.</i>

318
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:36,982
<i>Their zoom lenses are powerful</i>

319
00:25:37,061 --> 00:25:39,664
<i>to even read</i>
<i>the time on somebody's wristwatch.</i>

320
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:47,271
<i>They also use thermal imaging</i>
<i>to capture images at night.</i>

321
00:25:47,912 --> 00:25:49,313
Nothing stays hidden from them.

322
00:25:49,594 --> 00:25:51,676
Their vision can
penetrate through clouds.

323
00:26:03,327 --> 00:26:05,530
So my plan was to avoid them completely.

324
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:06,970
How would you do that?

325
00:26:07,932 --> 00:26:11,496
Indian Space Agency.

326
00:26:12,496 --> 00:26:14,419
But isn't that a
civilian organization?

327
00:26:15,299 --> 00:26:18,302
This is the only organization which
could monitor the American satellites

328
00:26:18,382 --> 00:26:21,105
and give us a timeline
during which we could work in Pokhran.

329
00:26:22,026 --> 00:26:24,829
My plan was to accommodate
science and common sense.

330
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:27,271
But nobody listened to
what I had to say.

331
00:26:28,632 --> 00:26:30,594
India would have been
a nuclear state today.

332
00:26:32,116 --> 00:26:32,916
We will be.

333
00:26:34,518 --> 00:26:36,199
We are planning another test.

334
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:48,171
After listening to your plan, I have a
feeling we'll be successful this time.

335
00:26:48,771 --> 00:26:51,054
The plan isn't as simple as it seems.

336
00:26:54,857 --> 00:26:56,098
Since you aren’t interested.

337
00:26:56,499 --> 00:26:57,421
And why would you be?

338
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,862
Anyone who takes up this job, won't get

339
00:27:00,182 --> 00:27:03,947
any official post, salary, medal, nothing.

340
00:27:06,588 --> 00:27:09,071
If you come across anyone
who would be interested...

341
00:27:20,002 --> 00:27:21,604
This is not a one man's job.

342
00:27:22,524 --> 00:27:24,607
We have to assemble
a team for this mission.

343
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:29,491
Go ahead.

344
00:29:14,833 --> 00:29:15,794
Ashwat?

345
00:29:16,354 --> 00:29:17,236
Ashwat!

346
00:29:18,597 --> 00:29:19,637
Why are you sleeping here?

347
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:23,402
Why don’t you sit with Mummy
and Papa while I make breakfast?

348
00:29:26,886 --> 00:29:29,607
Please take off your slippers.
We are watching <i>Mahabharata</i>.

349
00:29:32,891 --> 00:29:37,135
How did only five Pandavas
manage to defeat the hundred Kauravas?

350
00:29:37,415 --> 00:29:39,337
They took Lord Krishna's advice.

351
00:29:39,417 --> 00:29:40,818
While there were only five Pandavas,

352
00:29:40,899 --> 00:29:43,702
each of them had a specific goal.

353
00:29:44,022 --> 00:29:47,826
This focus made them very powerful.

354
00:29:49,227 --> 00:29:51,669
Powerful enough to
take on a hundred of them?

355
00:29:51,749 --> 00:29:52,870
Yes, of course.

356
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:53,991
Come and sit here.

357
00:29:55,272 --> 00:29:58,676
The eldest was Yudhishthir,
the righteous one.

358
00:29:59,356 --> 00:30:01,798
He always took the
morally correct path.

359
00:30:02,038 --> 00:30:05,682
Then there was Arjun, the one standing
behind Lord Krishna on the chariot.

360
00:30:06,284 --> 00:30:08,685
He never missed his target.

361
00:30:08,766 --> 00:30:10,408
That's how focused he was.

362
00:30:10,487 --> 00:30:13,770
<i>And then, there was the third part,</i>
<i>the most important one</i>

363
00:30:14,171 --> 00:30:15,692
<i>which nobody paid attention to.</i>

364
00:30:15,972 --> 00:30:16,854
<i>Secrecy.</i>

365
00:30:16,934 --> 00:30:21,698
Sehdev could look at the sky
and gauge what problems lay in the future.

366
00:30:22,138 --> 00:30:25,261
Nakul was known for his good looks

367
00:30:25,342 --> 00:30:27,944
but nothing escaped his eye.

368
00:30:28,625 --> 00:30:31,068
Now tell me something
about Lord Krishna.

369
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:05,660
<i>Mahabharata</i>?

370
00:31:07,983 --> 00:31:09,825
Pokhran is our battlefield.

371
00:31:10,146 --> 00:31:12,146
And the satellites are the enemy,
Kauravas.

372
00:31:12,988 --> 00:31:16,912
We need quality and not
quantity to win this war.

373
00:31:17,753 --> 00:31:20,115
Five Pandavas were enough
to take on the hundred Kauravas.

374
00:31:22,196 --> 00:31:25,760
Only one member will be our point
of contact from each organization.

375
00:31:26,281 --> 00:31:29,324
Nobody else will know
anything about this mission.

376
00:31:29,765 --> 00:31:31,086
The eldest brother....

377
00:31:32,046 --> 00:31:33,728
BARC.

378
00:31:34,688 --> 00:31:37,612
Bhabha Atomic Research Centre
which will provide us with the bombs.

379
00:31:38,532 --> 00:31:42,216
Our point of contact
there will be Yudhishthir.

380
00:31:43,898 --> 00:31:45,139
Dr. Viraf Wadia.

381
00:31:45,219 --> 00:31:46,981
The youngest scientist
to win the Presidential award.

382
00:31:48,462 --> 00:31:51,425
What was your inspiration
behind Nuclear Energy Research?

383
00:31:51,545 --> 00:31:52,507
An elevator.

384
00:31:52,587 --> 00:31:53,547
-An elevator?
-Yes.

385
00:31:53,628 --> 00:31:54,468
What do you mean?

386
00:31:54,548 --> 00:31:56,230
Few years ago,
I got stuck in an elevator.

387
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:57,551
And I couldn’t breathe.

388
00:31:59,354 --> 00:32:02,956
That's when I decided that this
country needs unlimited power supply.

389
00:32:05,238 --> 00:32:07,881
Hopefully, one day, there
will be no power cuts in India

390
00:32:08,121 --> 00:32:09,523
and no one will get stuck
in an elevator.

391
00:32:09,843 --> 00:32:10,684
Next. Arjun.

392
00:32:10,924 --> 00:32:12,526
Our defense lab, DRDO.

393
00:32:12,846 --> 00:32:15,488
They will supply detonators
needed for setting off these bombs.

394
00:32:15,608 --> 00:32:16,730
Dr. Naresh Sinha.

395
00:32:18,291 --> 00:32:19,733
He is with the DRDO
for the last 30 years.

396
00:32:23,616 --> 00:32:24,777
<i>Have you seen my wallet?</i>

397
00:32:24,898 --> 00:32:27,300
I had kept it right here.
Where has it gone?

398
00:32:29,583 --> 00:32:31,184
-Naughty!
-Your wallet!

399
00:32:31,624 --> 00:32:33,986
It’s in your pocket and
you’ve been looking all over the place.

400
00:32:34,947 --> 00:32:37,190
You launch huge missiles for the country

401
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:39,432
yet you can't remember
where you kept your wallet.

402
00:32:39,553 --> 00:32:40,833
Have I forgotten anything else?

403
00:32:40,913 --> 00:32:41,874
Your glasses.

404
00:32:46,519 --> 00:32:47,400
Bheem.

405
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,720
Major Prem from the army.

406
00:32:48,801 --> 00:32:51,043
He is already stationed
at the Pokhran range.

407
00:32:51,403 --> 00:32:53,686
He's the most capable officer
for this mission.

408
00:32:53,886 --> 00:32:55,447
Is this bunker at 135 degrees?

409
00:33:11,462 --> 00:33:12,304
Major Prem?

410
00:33:12,384 --> 00:33:15,146
Don’t you know he was a part of
our previous failed mission?

411
00:33:15,387 --> 00:33:17,749
Failure teaches a man many things.

412
00:33:21,953 --> 00:33:24,835
Sir, he is already aware of
the technical problems of the range.

413
00:33:30,642 --> 00:33:32,604
Sir, haven't you given
me a second chance?

414
00:33:41,371 --> 00:33:42,493
Puru Ranganathan.

415
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:44,856
From the Indian Space Agency.

416
00:33:47,018 --> 00:33:49,820
He is the man who will make our
schedule satellite proof...

417
00:33:51,261 --> 00:33:52,583
our Sehdev.

418
00:33:53,504 --> 00:33:54,625
<i>He is a true patriot.</i>

419
00:33:54,745 --> 00:33:57,467
<i>He could have taken up job offers</i>

420
00:33:57,788 --> 00:34:00,871
<i>from many international space</i>
<i>agencies in America, Russia, Germany.</i>

421
00:34:00,991 --> 00:34:02,593
<i>But he declined them all.</i>

422
00:34:04,114 --> 00:34:07,878
Our last Pandava,
Nakul, Intelligence Services.

423
00:34:08,158 --> 00:34:11,882
He will help us keep
on ground situations a secret. RAW.

424
00:34:15,486 --> 00:34:18,208
But they are always under the radar
of the CIA and other spy agencies.

425
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:24,373
The security of this entire mission
depends on this man.

426
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:42,712
The base of our mission
will be the Pokhran Fort

427
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:44,713
and she will make
this place secure for us.

428
00:34:45,195 --> 00:34:48,878
You will go there as officers
of the Archaeological Survey of India.

429
00:34:49,357 --> 00:34:50,719
I will get the IDs ready.

430
00:34:50,798 --> 00:34:53,402
Ambalika, the IDs will
not bear our original names.

431
00:34:56,125 --> 00:34:57,765
So am I Nakul?

432
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:02,811
Nice name for a girl.

433
00:35:07,856 --> 00:35:08,898
And what is your name?

434
00:35:09,377 --> 00:35:10,259
Hmm...

435
00:35:10,619 --> 00:35:11,541
Krishna.

436
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:13,861
Krishna Joshi.

437
00:35:15,464 --> 00:35:16,705
Our guide.

438
00:35:18,386 --> 00:35:19,306
Our leader.

439
00:35:19,547 --> 00:35:22,911
I'll make travel and accommodation
bookings in the names of the Pandavas.

440
00:35:29,157 --> 00:35:30,718
-It would be safe that way.
-Sir, who is this?

441
00:35:36,724 --> 00:35:37,565
Siddhant.

442
00:35:46,614 --> 00:35:47,736
He is a martyr.

443
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:54,783
But you don’t get your hopes up.

444
00:35:55,063 --> 00:35:56,944
All the credit will go
to the scientists and engineers.

445
00:35:58,346 --> 00:35:59,907
Sir, you might have misunderstood me.

446
00:36:44,511 --> 00:36:47,514
This is the only place
worth visiting in this desert.

447
00:36:47,593 --> 00:36:48,875
{\an8}And they have closed
it for the public.

448
00:36:48,954 --> 00:36:50,917
{\an8}What is this country coming to?

449
00:36:51,397 --> 00:36:52,398
Come on, move.

450
00:36:52,478 --> 00:36:53,599
This place is closed.

451
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:55,041
-Let's go.
-Hey!

452
00:36:55,241 --> 00:36:56,121
Move back.

453
00:36:56,802 --> 00:36:57,723
Move back.

454
00:37:03,688 --> 00:37:04,970
-Let him through.
-Move back.

455
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:08,053
-Move back. Move back.
-Can't you see?

456
00:37:21,747 --> 00:37:23,508
The fort is being secured.

457
00:37:23,628 --> 00:37:25,670
It will be done by tonight.

458
00:37:29,074 --> 00:37:30,956
I don’t think we should secure
the guest house.

459
00:37:31,837 --> 00:37:33,037
The locals might get suspicious.

460
00:37:34,599 --> 00:37:36,721
Listen, I’m responsible
for your security.

461
00:37:38,883 --> 00:37:40,244
This is what happened in 1995 as well.

462
00:37:40,324 --> 00:37:42,927
The scientists and engineers
were accompanied by guards everywhere.

463
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:48,292
Only you and I will have cell phones.

464
00:37:50,695 --> 00:37:51,535
Is the team here?

465
00:37:54,699 --> 00:37:57,662
It's so hot in here, how will we work?

466
00:37:58,182 --> 00:37:59,783
This isn’t a hill station.

467
00:38:01,305 --> 00:38:03,307
Try being in an army bunker,

468
00:38:03,628 --> 00:38:05,549
this cooler will feel like
an air conditioner.

469
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:08,311
Inspite of being a scientist,
I don't know how to operate a fax machine.

470
00:38:09,112 --> 00:38:11,995
I don't know what the problem is.

471
00:38:12,435 --> 00:38:15,438
Let me check,
might be some issue with the circuits.

472
00:38:27,531 --> 00:38:28,691
Ashwat Raina.

473
00:38:28,771 --> 00:38:30,654
Ashwat, you know everyone here.

474
00:38:42,225 --> 00:38:43,105
Shall we start?

475
00:38:51,794 --> 00:38:52,835
Get used to it.

476
00:38:53,516 --> 00:38:54,797
There's a lot of dust there.

477
00:38:56,158 --> 00:38:57,160
Pokhran range.

478
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:00,123
We have to test not one
but six nuclear bombs

479
00:39:00,323 --> 00:39:02,004
in the next 30 days.

480
00:39:02,484 --> 00:39:03,886
And that too in secret.

481
00:39:06,288 --> 00:39:08,370
These three shafts are
already present in the range.

482
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:10,893
White House, Taj Mahal

483
00:39:11,173 --> 00:39:12,253
and Kumbhkaran.

484
00:39:12,894 --> 00:39:14,416
But they are now filled with water.

485
00:39:14,577 --> 00:39:16,057
And it won't be easy
to remove the water

486
00:39:16,137 --> 00:39:18,340
as they are almost 250 meters deep.

487
00:39:18,419 --> 00:39:19,461
And what about the other three shafts?

488
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:21,662
We do not have time to dig new shafts.

489
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:29,269
which we can use.

490
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:31,992
They should be ready
one week before the tests.

491
00:39:32,073 --> 00:39:34,636
So that I can assemble
the bombs in the prayer hall

492
00:39:34,715 --> 00:39:36,317
and install them in the shafts.

493
00:39:36,998 --> 00:39:41,362
We have to connect the bombs
to the control room with cables.

494
00:39:43,203 --> 00:39:46,687
Inside the control room,
there will be six safety locks.

495
00:39:51,571 --> 00:39:54,735
The plan looks easy, but it will be
difficult to keep this mission covert.

496
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:58,579
Three American satellites have been
hovering over us since 1995.

497
00:39:59,619 --> 00:40:04,344
But there is a gap of a few hours

498
00:40:04,904 --> 00:40:06,867
as these satellites swap positions.

499
00:40:07,268 --> 00:40:10,150
During this gap, no one is able
to see what is happening on the range.

500
00:40:16,035 --> 00:40:18,598
Every day, we will
get two such blind spots.

501
00:40:19,118 --> 00:40:21,081
One during day,
the other at night.

502
00:40:21,722 --> 00:40:23,804
We will do the work during
the blind spot at night.

503
00:40:24,084 --> 00:40:27,287
It gets scorching hot during the day and
Pokhran gets lots of sandstorms.

504
00:40:27,487 --> 00:40:30,691
You will be given new pass codes
every day to enter the range.

505
00:40:32,171 --> 00:40:33,293
Today's pass code.

506
00:40:36,897 --> 00:40:40,980
"Embrace me
for we might never get this night back."

507
00:40:43,502 --> 00:40:44,383
Exactly.

508
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:47,626
Er.. you mean,
a new pass code every day?

509
00:40:47,747 --> 00:40:48,547
Uh-huh.

510
00:40:48,628 --> 00:40:51,390
And you will only address
each other with your code names.

511
00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:52,391
Remember?

512
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:53,352
Nakul.

513
00:40:53,473 --> 00:40:54,313
Bheem.

514
00:40:54,473 --> 00:40:55,314
Yudhishthir.

515
00:40:55,394 --> 00:40:56,274
Sehdev.

516
00:40:56,555 --> 00:40:57,676
I am...

517
00:40:58,557 --> 00:41:00,439
The archer..

518
00:41:00,519 --> 00:41:01,400
Arjun.

519
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,162
Arjun. Yes, Arjun.

520
00:41:03,242 --> 00:41:06,164
And remember, code names and
pass codes are extremely important.

521
00:41:06,244 --> 00:41:07,846
There are spies everywhere.

522
00:41:08,046 --> 00:41:10,329
We will wear army uniforms
while working on the range.

523
00:41:10,408 --> 00:41:12,210
So that the local villagers
do not get suspicious.

524
00:41:13,212 --> 00:41:14,893
We have ordered
uniforms for all of us.

525
00:41:16,014 --> 00:41:19,898
It is imperative to cover the tracks
of our activity on the range.

526
00:41:21,099 --> 00:41:23,461
So that when the second satellite
returns to the orbit

527
00:41:24,822 --> 00:41:27,145
everything appears normal to them.

528
00:41:32,871 --> 00:41:34,552
By the way,
do you know what Pokhran means?

529
00:42:08,824 --> 00:42:11,107
You always wanted
to join the army, right?

530
00:42:21,957 --> 00:42:23,720
There is something
about these uniforms.

531
00:42:23,799 --> 00:42:26,443
Why don’t we cover ourselves
with blankets instead?

532
00:42:26,723 --> 00:42:29,204
We are dying in the heat anyway.

533
00:42:29,406 --> 00:42:31,247
How do I work in these loose pants?

534
00:42:31,567 --> 00:42:33,609
Should I concentrate on
my pants or the satellites' orbit?

535
00:42:40,976 --> 00:42:42,979
Doesn’t Major sound more senior?

536
00:42:47,422 --> 00:42:50,946
Do you have any idea
how difficult the life of a soldier is?

537
00:42:51,747 --> 00:42:53,949
You don’t know the significance
of these uniforms

538
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:55,430
which you are getting, for free.

539
00:42:55,791 --> 00:42:56,792
-You...
-Major.

540
00:42:59,715 --> 00:43:02,558
Please consider us as members
of your unit for the next few days.

541
00:43:03,318 --> 00:43:04,960
We are all new to this situation.

542
00:43:07,482 --> 00:43:10,486
We will try our best to
become worthy of this uniform...

543
00:43:11,686 --> 00:43:13,489
by the end of this mission.

544
00:43:20,815 --> 00:43:23,418
<i>The ground trembles</i>
<i>As we stride ahead</i>

545
00:43:23,498 --> 00:43:25,740
<i>There is no stopping us now</i>

546
00:43:26,141 --> 00:43:28,742
<i>Fulfilling our duties</i>
<i>With our heads held high</i>

547
00:43:28,822 --> 00:43:30,704
<i>We refuse to bow down</i>

548
00:43:31,426 --> 00:43:34,028
<i>The ground trembles</i>
<i>As we stride ahead</i>

549
00:43:34,108 --> 00:43:36,471
<i>There is no stopping us now</i>

550
00:43:36,751 --> 00:43:39,353
<i>Fulfilling our duties</i>
<i>With our heads held high</i>

551
00:43:39,433 --> 00:43:41,315
<i>We refuse to bow down</i>

552
00:43:42,436 --> 00:43:47,201
<i>For you, my motherland</i>

553
00:43:47,361 --> 00:43:51,925
<i>I shall lay down my life for you</i>

554
00:43:53,087 --> 00:43:57,931
<i>For you, my motherland</i>

555
00:43:58,051 --> 00:44:01,815
<i>I will leave no stone unturned</i>

556
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:07,460
What is the pass code for today?

557
00:44:10,183 --> 00:44:12,706
Embrace me, for we might
never get this night back.

558
00:44:14,347 --> 00:44:15,188
Carry on.

559
00:44:16,510 --> 00:44:19,072
<i>The ground trembles</i>
<i>As we stride ahead</i>

560
00:44:19,152 --> 00:44:21,154
<i>There is no stopping us now</i>

561
00:44:21,794 --> 00:44:24,397
<i>Fulfilling our duties</i>
<i>With our heads held high</i>

562
00:44:24,476 --> 00:44:26,319
<i>We refuse to bow down</i>

563
00:44:27,479 --> 00:44:32,325
<i>For you, my motherland</i>

564
00:44:32,645 --> 00:44:37,369
<i>I shall lay down my life for you</i>

565
00:44:38,090 --> 00:44:42,975
<i>For you, my motherland</i>

566
00:44:43,335 --> 00:44:47,419
<i>I will leave no stone unturned</i>

567
00:44:53,986 --> 00:44:58,871
<i>My dreams were fettered</i>
<i>All this while</i>

568
00:44:59,271 --> 00:45:03,035
{\an8}<i>And could not touch the sky</i>

569
00:45:04,515 --> 00:45:09,441
{\an8}<i>The road ahead beckons us</i>

570
00:45:09,881 --> 00:45:14,085
<i>With renewed hope we march</i>

571
00:45:15,167 --> 00:45:20,131
<i>For you, my motherland</i>

572
00:45:20,251 --> 00:45:24,575
<i>I shall lay down my life for you</i>

573
00:45:25,857 --> 00:45:30,821
<i>For you, my motherland</i>

574
00:45:31,101 --> 00:45:34,545
{\an8}<i>I will leave no stone unturned</i>

575
00:45:36,027 --> 00:45:38,590
<i>The ground trembles</i>
<i>As we stride ahead</i>

576
00:45:38,669 --> 00:45:40,511
<i>There is no stopping us now</i>

577
00:45:41,311 --> 00:45:43,874
<i>Fulfilling our duties</i>
<i>With our heads held high</i>

578
00:45:43,954 --> 00:45:45,917
<i>We refuse to bow down</i>

579
00:45:46,596 --> 00:45:49,200
<i>The ground trembles</i>
<i>As we stride ahead</i>

580
00:45:49,279 --> 00:45:51,201
<i>There is no stopping us now</i>

581
00:45:51,923 --> 00:45:54,524
<i>Fulfilling our duties</i>
<i>With our heads held high</i>

582
00:45:54,604 --> 00:45:56,767
<i>We refuse to bow down</i>

583
00:46:26,996 --> 00:46:29,639
This thing is taking way too long
to go down.

584
00:46:30,919 --> 00:46:32,481
All these sheets are rusted.

585
00:46:38,086 --> 00:46:40,329
It will take us time
to get this shaft ready.

586
00:46:43,371 --> 00:46:45,174
That's it.
We can't go any further.

587
00:46:45,294 --> 00:46:46,895
There is a lot of water underneath.

588
00:46:52,781 --> 00:46:55,063
Can we stop for a minute?

589
00:46:55,544 --> 00:46:57,666
You need to be strong
if you want to move up the ranks.

590
00:46:57,946 --> 00:46:58,787
Look up.

591
00:49:01,106 --> 00:49:01,986
Keep it here.

592
00:49:08,593 --> 00:49:10,514
At this speed, we will not
be able to pump out the water in time.

593
00:49:14,919 --> 00:49:17,963
We need more powerful pumps.

594
00:49:41,866 --> 00:49:43,586
But the water will
continue to flow out.

595
00:49:43,667 --> 00:49:44,788
How do we hide this?

596
00:49:44,869 --> 00:49:46,189
There's no need to.

597
00:49:48,512 --> 00:49:50,634
The satellite will detect this board

598
00:49:51,035 --> 00:49:53,156
and assume that there is a
water supply training going on here.

599
00:50:15,778 --> 00:50:16,738
Lower.

600
00:50:47,569 --> 00:50:48,490
Hurry up!

601
00:50:49,610 --> 00:50:50,572
Go back!

602
00:50:50,653 --> 00:50:52,173
Soldiers, go toward your bunkers.

603
00:51:24,445 --> 00:51:26,606
Otherwise, we will read
about it in tomorrow's newspaper.

604
00:52:14,894 --> 00:52:17,537
In the past 18 hours,
there has been a lot of activity

605
00:52:17,617 --> 00:52:19,057
going on around the range.

606
00:52:19,258 --> 00:52:21,620
I mean there is
a lot of movement to and fro.

607
00:52:39,839 --> 00:52:43,041
You know how powerful
the American satellites are!

608
00:52:43,882 --> 00:52:45,243
There is nothing
going on at the range.

609
00:52:45,324 --> 00:52:46,284
See this.

610
00:52:47,406 --> 00:52:50,729
These people who are working
to restore the Pokhran Fort

611
00:52:51,689 --> 00:52:55,894
can be seen here
again in army uniforms.

612
00:52:56,695 --> 00:52:57,536
How?

613
00:52:59,698 --> 00:53:02,660
We should go to Pokhran.

614
00:53:25,522 --> 00:53:27,685
We have to work like this
for the next 29 days.

615
00:53:29,767 --> 00:53:31,047
When are you going to get the stores?

616
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:32,569
The storekeepers have been informed.

617
00:53:32,649 --> 00:53:34,211
I will get them on the 28th of April.

618
00:53:36,012 --> 00:53:37,334
That's <i>Akshay Tritiya</i>,
an auspicious day.

619
00:53:39,095 --> 00:53:40,137
Stores?

620
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:42,258
By stores, we mean bomb! Bomb!

621
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:44,341
How will you get them?

622
00:53:47,143 --> 00:53:50,187
Each plutonium ball
is a bit bigger than this.

623
00:53:54,871 --> 00:53:56,233
I could get it on a scooter.

624
00:53:57,114 --> 00:53:58,394
You can try the scooter later.

625
00:53:58,475 --> 00:54:00,277
For the stores,
we'll stick to the plan.

626
00:54:02,118 --> 00:54:05,040
Major Prem has arranged
four armor-plated trucks for you.

627
00:54:05,441 --> 00:54:06,843
You will reach BARC late at night.

628
00:54:08,604 --> 00:54:09,645
{\an8}<i>At around 2 a.m.</i>

629
00:54:10,206 --> 00:54:11,887
{\an8}<i>So that there aren’t</i>
<i>many staff members around.</i>

630
00:54:29,265 --> 00:54:30,666
Where are you taking these packages?

631
00:54:32,226 --> 00:54:33,709
That's all I know.

632
00:54:57,812 --> 00:55:00,014
<i>From there,</i>
<i>you will head to Mumbai Airport.</i>

633
00:55:14,468 --> 00:55:18,151
The unsuspecting people of this city
have no idea about this.

634
00:55:18,472 --> 00:55:21,595
If these go off,
the entire city will be reduced to rubble.

635
00:55:21,675 --> 00:55:22,717
Really?

636
00:55:31,284 --> 00:55:33,767
<i>You will land at</i>
<i>Jaisalmer airport at 10 a.m.</i>

637
00:55:34,247 --> 00:55:36,770
<i>Major Prem and Ambalika</i>
<i>will meet you at the airport.</i>

638
00:55:37,490 --> 00:55:38,973
<i>There will be another</i>
<i>set of armor-plated trucks</i>

639
00:55:39,053 --> 00:55:41,094
<i>ready to take the stores</i>
<i>to the range.</i>

640
00:55:51,864 --> 00:55:53,987
The satellite blind spot
starts at 20:03.

641
00:55:56,749 --> 00:55:58,670
The armored trucks
should not be anywhere

642
00:55:58,751 --> 00:56:00,393
close to the range
before the blind spot starts.

643
00:56:02,114 --> 00:56:05,679
That means we can't leave
this place before 6 p.m.

644
00:56:06,399 --> 00:56:07,920
What will we do for so long?

645
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:10,483
Why don’t you
do some sightseeing in Jaisalmer?

646
00:56:16,048 --> 00:56:20,333
<i>The roads are joyous</i>
<i>Flowers have bloomed</i>

647
00:56:20,412 --> 00:56:25,056
<i>Adorned in finery, my dreams rejoice</i>

648
00:56:25,137 --> 00:56:29,302
<i>The earth welcomes</i>
<i>The arrival of the rain clouds</i>

649
00:56:29,381 --> 00:56:33,745
<i>Celebrate with sweets, join</i>
<i>The merrymaking, it's time to celebrate</i>

650
00:56:33,825 --> 00:56:39,031
<i>These rain clouds bring</i>
<i>Showers of happiness</i>

651
00:56:41,112 --> 00:56:43,835
<i>It is a day for festivities</i>

652
00:56:49,681 --> 00:56:54,165
<i>It is a day for festivities</i>
<i>There is color all around</i>

653
00:56:54,245 --> 00:56:58,770
<i>Happiness abounds</i>
<i>Smiles everywhere</i>

654
00:56:58,970 --> 00:57:02,253
<i>It is a day for festivities</i>

655
00:57:14,705 --> 00:57:18,909
<i>Call upon the moon and bring the lamps</i>
<i>Gather all the dazzling stars</i>

656
00:57:21,752 --> 00:57:23,674
If the word gets out,
everyone will know.

657
00:57:23,753 --> 00:57:25,556
<i>Gather all the dazzling stars</i>

658
00:57:25,636 --> 00:57:27,678
<i>Gather all the dazzling stars</i>

659
00:57:27,758 --> 00:57:32,123
<i>Gather all the dazzling stars</i>

660
00:57:32,722 --> 00:57:37,167
<i>Let us spread happiness</i>

661
00:57:37,247 --> 00:57:40,890
<i>Let every heart be filled with joy</i>

662
00:57:40,970 --> 00:57:45,696
<i>To rejoice on this wonderful day</i>

663
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:55,865
<i>Welcome to the land of festivities</i>

664
00:57:56,026 --> 00:57:58,749
<i>Welcome to the land of festivities</i>

665
00:57:59,148 --> 00:58:01,110
<i>-Sing praises on this glorious day</i>
<i>-It is a glorious day</i>

666
00:58:01,190 --> 00:58:02,912
<i>-Rejoice on this glorious day</i>
<i>-It is a glorious day</i>

667
00:58:02,992 --> 00:58:04,913
<i>-Adorn with flowers</i>
<i>-It is a glorious day</i>

668
00:58:04,995 --> 00:58:06,356
<i>Let us celebrate</i>

669
00:58:06,916 --> 00:58:10,559
<i>It is a day for festivities</i>

670
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:14,683
<i>It is a day for festivities</i>

671
00:58:14,763 --> 00:58:19,128
<i>Welcome!</i>

672
00:58:19,328 --> 00:58:20,369
Wow!

673
00:58:23,692 --> 00:58:25,895
Krishna, sir, there is a
call for you from Delhi.

674
00:58:28,898 --> 00:58:30,939
Sir, perfect timing.
I was about to call you.

675
00:58:32,341 --> 00:58:33,341
The stores are here.

676
00:58:33,421 --> 00:58:34,943
Ashwat, stop everything for now.

677
00:58:35,664 --> 00:58:37,065
We may not be able to conduct this test.

678
00:58:37,745 --> 00:58:38,587
How?

679
00:58:38,667 --> 00:58:39,867
Ashwat, I can't give you
any details right now.

680
00:59:28,876 --> 00:59:32,959
<i>There has been a lot of pressure</i>
<i>on the Vajpayee government.</i>

681
00:59:33,159 --> 00:59:36,563
<i>Some of the main coalition partners</i>
<i>might withdraw their support.</i>

682
00:59:36,642 --> 00:59:38,925
<i>There was a lot of commotion in the</i>
<i>parliament today regarding the same.</i>

683
00:59:42,569 --> 00:59:44,691
Oh yes, I remember,
for Prahlad's school.

684
00:59:44,972 --> 00:59:45,932
What’s wrong?

685
00:59:46,573 --> 00:59:49,735
This is the first time you're sounding
so low after going to Delhi.

686
00:59:50,656 --> 00:59:54,741
You don’t sound excited about
meeting your wife and son.

687
00:59:55,181 --> 00:59:56,222
<i>Is everything all right?</i>

688
00:59:56,382 --> 00:59:59,385
That is not true, Sushma.
I miss both of you a lot.

689
00:59:59,745 --> 01:00:01,227
There is a lot of
work-related stress here.

690
01:00:03,389 --> 01:00:05,912
Teaching jobs are getting
very stressful nowadays.

691
01:00:06,152 --> 01:00:07,754
It's not that, Sushma.

692
01:00:08,354 --> 01:00:09,514
The situation here is different.

693
01:00:09,835 --> 01:00:11,918
Yes, and you won't discuss it with me.

694
01:00:13,519 --> 01:00:16,242
You're taking this job as seriously
as your last job,

695
01:00:16,321 --> 01:00:18,604
like you're working for
the Prime Minister.

696
01:00:24,248 --> 01:00:25,570
<i>I didn’t mean that.</i>

697
01:00:27,773 --> 01:00:28,613
Ashwat.

698
01:00:31,576 --> 01:00:33,618
<i>You've got this opportunity</i>
<i>after a long time.</i>

699
01:00:49,394 --> 01:00:51,476
<i>Whenever it was necessary,</i>

700
01:00:51,836 --> 01:00:55,719
<i>we provided a strong support to</i>
<i>the ruling party of that time...</i>

701
01:00:56,521 --> 01:00:58,202
Do you know how serious
the situation is right now?

702
01:00:58,563 --> 01:01:02,207
Coalition parties are threatening us
of withdrawing their support.

703
01:01:02,806 --> 01:01:05,529
How will we conduct this test if
the Prime Minister is no longer in office?

704
01:01:07,732 --> 01:01:09,173
When will they table
the no-confidence motion?

705
01:01:09,253 --> 01:01:10,173
In two weeks.

706
01:01:10,895 --> 01:01:13,577
What if we conduct the test
in the next ten days?

707
01:01:14,979 --> 01:01:17,340
Look, I understand
you do not understand politics.

708
01:01:19,583 --> 01:01:20,503
You should know

709
01:01:20,583 --> 01:01:22,066
a task which seems difficult
to complete in 15 days

710
01:01:22,145 --> 01:01:23,986
will be impossible to complete in ten.

711
01:01:25,309 --> 01:01:26,189
I can do it.

712
01:01:27,992 --> 01:01:30,113
Your son sacrificed
his life for the country.

713
01:01:30,473 --> 01:01:32,235
He was not afraid of taking risks.

714
01:01:36,759 --> 01:01:40,362
My son laid down his life
to uphold the country's honor

715
01:01:40,443 --> 01:01:42,926
and you want to put
the country's honor at stake!

716
01:01:46,209 --> 01:01:49,652
<i>I want this tradition to continue.</i>

717
01:01:50,212 --> 01:01:53,135
<i>This power struggle will continue,</i>
<i>governments will come and go</i>

718
01:01:53,215 --> 01:01:55,057
<i>political parties will keep changing,</i>

719
01:01:55,297 --> 01:01:59,822
<i>but this country and its democracy</i>
<i>should march on.</i>

720
01:02:03,225 --> 01:02:05,307
Thank God, his interview went well.

721
01:02:05,668 --> 01:02:07,710
He knew the answers
to all the questions.

722
01:02:07,790 --> 01:02:08,751
Hmm.

723
01:02:09,511 --> 01:02:10,673
What hmm, Ashwat?

724
01:02:11,234 --> 01:02:12,875
You were not paying attention.

725
01:02:13,916 --> 01:02:16,758
Couldn’t you be
stress-free for one day?

726
01:02:16,838 --> 01:02:18,720
I am sorry.
There is a problem at work so...

727
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:20,081
What work?

728
01:02:21,003 --> 01:02:23,725
You have changed so much
because of this job.

729
01:02:28,570 --> 01:02:29,931
What is this sound?

730
01:02:30,011 --> 01:02:31,333
Which sound?

731
01:02:31,653 --> 01:02:33,013
-I heard something ring...
-Prahlad!

732
01:02:33,535 --> 01:02:34,616
Prahlad!

733
01:02:37,459 --> 01:02:39,220
Come on, both of you should leave now.

734
01:02:39,501 --> 01:02:40,822
What do you mean by leave?

735
01:02:41,222 --> 01:02:42,863
Aren’t we going to your house?

736
01:02:43,343 --> 01:02:45,386
Ashwat, we will get his form
in the evening.

737
01:02:45,467 --> 01:02:46,868
We can spend some time together
till then.

738
01:02:46,947 --> 01:02:48,829
Sushma, it will get very late
by the time you reach Mussoorie.

739
01:02:48,910 --> 01:02:50,792
I will collect the form
and mail it to you.

740
01:02:50,872 --> 01:02:52,953
As it is,
it's unsafe to travel at night.

741
01:02:55,075 --> 01:02:56,077
Come on.

742
01:02:58,199 --> 01:02:59,439
Driver, be careful.

743
01:03:18,738 --> 01:03:19,659
Ten days!

744
01:03:20,821 --> 01:03:21,701
It can't be done.

745
01:03:23,704 --> 01:03:25,785
We haven’t even finished
half the cabling yet.

746
01:03:25,946 --> 01:03:29,189
It will take ages to get the approval

747
01:03:29,269 --> 01:03:30,390
for the delivery dates
of the detonators, Akshat.

748
01:03:30,510 --> 01:03:31,991
-Ashwat.
-Ashwat.

749
01:03:32,311 --> 01:03:33,953
Then use your seniority.

750
01:03:34,435 --> 01:03:37,437
The detonators should reach here
in "T minus 3" days.

751
01:03:37,597 --> 01:03:39,559
Ashwat, we need to
put sandbags in the shafts.

752
01:03:39,678 --> 01:03:41,881
They need to be tightly packed.

753
01:03:42,242 --> 01:03:44,484
We were already on a tight schedule.
How can we do it any faster?

754
01:03:44,604 --> 01:03:45,404
Day shift.

755
01:03:45,485 --> 01:03:48,288
Puru, what time does the satellites’
blind spot start during the day?

756
01:03:48,367 --> 01:03:49,369
It is very risky during the day.

757
01:03:50,130 --> 01:03:51,531
Ashwat, you know
there are a lot of sandstorms

758
01:03:51,610 --> 01:03:52,971
at the range during daytime.

759
01:03:54,093 --> 01:03:56,896
It is your job to handle
such difficult situations.

760
01:03:57,457 --> 01:03:59,058
We will conduct the tests
in ten days and that's final.

761
01:04:01,900 --> 01:04:04,103
Do you know how powerful
these bombs are?

762
01:04:04,383 --> 01:04:06,425
If these shafts are
not sealed properly,

763
01:04:06,505 --> 01:04:09,107
not just Pokhran, but the entire
Rajasthan will be reduced to rubble.

764
01:04:09,668 --> 01:04:11,149
We need hundred percent precision

765
01:04:11,230 --> 01:04:13,071
and two hundred percent
planning in this.

766
01:04:13,513 --> 01:04:15,874
We will be testing three
different bombs at the same time.

767
01:04:16,194 --> 01:04:18,276
Ten days are enough for
your hundred percent precision

768
01:04:18,357 --> 01:04:19,637
and two hundred percent planning.

769
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:22,280
Don’t tell me what the problem is,
find a solution.

770
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:23,362
Ashwat.

771
01:04:23,522 --> 01:04:25,524
This is how the test got compromised
the last time as well.

772
01:04:25,683 --> 01:04:27,366
Why are you giving in
to political pressure?

773
01:04:29,767 --> 01:04:31,450
Please don’t worry about failure.

774
01:04:33,010 --> 01:04:34,372
If we fail this time...

775
01:04:35,653 --> 01:04:36,975
it will be my responsibility again.

776
01:04:54,631 --> 01:04:55,552
Take this.

777
01:04:55,633 --> 01:04:57,154
Plug this one here
and that one there.

778
01:04:57,354 --> 01:04:58,515
I am so tired.

779
01:04:58,596 --> 01:04:59,516
I have never worked in so much heat.

780
01:05:02,919 --> 01:05:03,921
Plug them in now!

781
01:05:23,421 --> 01:05:24,221
Start wrapping up.

782
01:05:41,717 --> 01:05:43,240
There are only nine days to go now.

783
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,641
I don’t think I will last that long.

784
01:05:45,962 --> 01:05:48,443
Ashwat is making plans for my funeral.

785
01:05:50,966 --> 01:05:53,129
If we keep up this speed,
we'll finish on time.

786
01:06:56,591 --> 01:06:58,232
How much time do we have
before the satellite returns?

787
01:06:59,754 --> 01:07:00,794
All the covers have been blown away.

788
01:07:00,874 --> 01:07:02,476
The shafts,
machines, everything is visible.

789
01:07:45,117 --> 01:07:46,679
Only five minutes are left.
Leave quickly.

790
01:08:08,060 --> 01:08:08,981
What's wrong?

791
01:08:47,858 --> 01:08:50,020
I had warned him about the sandstorms.

792
01:09:30,779 --> 01:09:31,782
Hmm.

793
01:09:32,782 --> 01:09:33,622
What happened?

794
01:09:38,067 --> 01:09:39,228
What is it? Did you find something?

795
01:09:43,032 --> 01:09:44,033
What did they miss?

796
01:09:45,274 --> 01:09:47,595
This jeep is parked in
the opposite direction.

797
01:09:48,317 --> 01:09:52,481
But here its direction matches
that of the other vehicles.

798
01:09:53,922 --> 01:09:54,844
So?

799
01:09:55,405 --> 01:10:00,089
If the jeep has moved,
where are its tire marks?

800
01:10:00,850 --> 01:10:04,012
Tire marks are visible
for days in the desert.

801
01:10:05,134 --> 01:10:08,097
Wow, Mr. Daniel. Well done.
That's an excellent observation.

802
01:10:08,258 --> 01:10:11,340
I suggest you call the CIA right away
and tell them everything.

803
01:10:11,420 --> 01:10:13,302
They will inform Bill Clinton,
and by tomorrow morning

804
01:10:13,382 --> 01:10:14,704
the Indian Prime Minister
will receive a phone call.

805
01:10:14,784 --> 01:10:16,264
And all this will stop immediately.

806
01:10:16,705 --> 01:10:17,546
Take it easy.

807
01:10:17,987 --> 01:10:19,908
We need more proof.
More.

808
01:10:20,588 --> 01:10:22,151
How much more proof do you want?

809
01:10:23,832 --> 01:10:25,194
{\an8}The heat has burned my insides.

810
01:10:25,674 --> 01:10:27,155
{\an8}I can't even enjoy <i>chaat</i>.

811
01:10:28,357 --> 01:10:29,998
{\an8}Why are you being so dramatic?

812
01:10:30,599 --> 01:10:32,120
{\an8}Hurry up,
our night shift is about to start.

813
01:10:33,241 --> 01:10:35,363
{\an8}You sit in front of
the air conditioner all day

814
01:10:35,444 --> 01:10:36,964
{\an8}while we're toiling in the heat.

815
01:10:39,487 --> 01:10:40,368
Make it spicy.

816
01:10:42,130 --> 01:10:43,531
-Daniel.
-Sehdev.

817
01:10:43,731 --> 01:10:44,653
Ah, Sehdev.

818
01:10:51,899 --> 01:10:54,823
I've seen the Taj Mahal
and the Qutub Minar

819
01:10:54,902 --> 01:10:56,864
but I am
yet to see the Pokhran Fort.

820
01:11:06,393 --> 01:11:07,235
Yes.

821
01:11:17,325 --> 01:11:19,006
But Ashwat's family is not here.

822
01:11:27,013 --> 01:11:29,656
-What was he talking about?
-Nothing.

823
01:11:32,138 --> 01:11:35,182
Hmm, I love spicy food.

824
01:11:46,632 --> 01:11:47,994
All these names are aliases.

825
01:11:48,434 --> 01:11:50,236
The five Pandavas from the <i>Mahabharata</i>.

826
01:11:50,517 --> 01:11:52,798
Yudhishthir, Bheem, Arjun, Nakul, Sehdev.

827
01:11:55,361 --> 01:11:59,165
Ashwat is the only real name,
Ashwat Raina.

828
01:12:01,167 --> 01:12:03,570
He was a part of the
previous nuclear project.

829
01:12:07,374 --> 01:12:11,137
Our Pakistani ISI
is no less than your CIA.

830
01:12:20,906 --> 01:12:21,867
Papa, it's Ashwat.

831
01:12:21,947 --> 01:12:23,108
Where are you?

832
01:12:23,268 --> 01:12:25,230
Have you forgotten your family
after going to Delhi?

833
01:12:25,390 --> 01:12:26,591
That's not true, Papa.

834
01:12:26,792 --> 01:12:30,795
<i>Why don’t you call regularly?</i>

835
01:12:31,236 --> 01:12:32,918
<i>Sushma worries a lot.</i>

836
01:12:33,317 --> 01:12:36,080
<i>She is managing everything by herself.</i>

837
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:37,602
<i>Talk to her.</i>

838
01:12:37,963 --> 01:12:38,963
<i>Sushma.</i>

839
01:12:39,043 --> 01:12:39,844
<i>Yes, Papa?</i>

840
01:12:39,924 --> 01:12:41,206
<i>Ashwat is on the line.</i>

841
01:12:45,770 --> 01:12:47,332
Why haven’t you called
in the last two days?

842
01:12:47,532 --> 01:12:49,293
I was busy at work. Double shifts.

843
01:12:49,694 --> 01:12:52,417
Are you hiding something from me, Ashwat?
Huh?

844
01:12:52,497 --> 01:12:55,779
There is no Engineering department
at your university

845
01:12:55,859 --> 01:12:58,663
<i>nor do they have any</i>
<i>Ashwat Raina working for them.</i>

846
01:12:58,822 --> 01:12:59,863
What's happening?

847
01:12:59,943 --> 01:13:01,466
Did you call the university?

848
01:13:03,508 --> 01:13:05,509
You forgot to send Prahlad's school form.

849
01:13:05,589 --> 01:13:07,152
You haven’t even been
in touch for two days.

850
01:13:10,835 --> 01:13:13,237
It’s a new department.
We have separate phone lines.

851
01:13:13,317 --> 01:13:15,639
<i>I'll take a week off</i>
<i>and join you guys.</i>

852
01:13:16,921 --> 01:13:19,442
The deadline is approaching,
please mail the form

853
01:13:19,522 --> 01:13:20,844
<i>and give me their phone number.</i>

854
01:13:20,924 --> 01:13:22,045
So that I can call you.

855
01:13:23,166 --> 01:13:24,768
Sushma, I don’t remember the number.

856
01:13:26,129 --> 01:13:28,011
There are a lot of people waiting outside.

857
01:13:30,774 --> 01:13:31,575
But...

858
01:13:44,628 --> 01:13:45,748
<i>He is lying to his wife as well.</i>

859
01:13:46,950 --> 01:13:49,953
She thinks he is teaching
at a university in Delhi.

860
01:13:50,273 --> 01:13:51,834
Hey, can you get me some onions?

861
01:13:55,278 --> 01:13:57,479
If his wife finds out,

862
01:13:57,560 --> 01:13:59,562
he is in Pokhran...

863
01:14:01,004 --> 01:14:03,045
Then he will have
to tell her the truth.

864
01:14:04,927 --> 01:14:06,368
Should we add some fuel to the fire?

865
01:14:13,254 --> 01:14:14,577
Is this Ms. Sushma?

866
01:14:14,817 --> 01:14:15,697
<i>Yes.</i>

867
01:14:16,017 --> 01:14:17,379
Greetings, Ms. Sushma.

868
01:14:17,580 --> 01:14:20,062
Ashwat has asked me
to mail something to you.

869
01:14:20,222 --> 01:14:21,343
Yes, tell me.

870
01:14:21,543 --> 01:14:24,385
He was in a hurry and forgot
to write down the zip code.

871
01:14:24,506 --> 01:14:26,668
If you could tell me,
I will send it right away.

872
01:14:26,749 --> 01:14:28,350
Just a minute, I will tell you.

873
01:14:28,429 --> 01:14:30,351
Are you calling from
the university campus?

874
01:14:30,432 --> 01:14:31,312
Campus?

875
01:14:31,873 --> 01:14:34,235
No, I am calling from Pokhran,
Rajasthan.

876
01:14:34,316 --> 01:14:35,717
From the RTDC guesthouse.

877
01:14:36,116 --> 01:14:37,879
Ashwat is staying here.

878
01:14:43,404 --> 01:14:44,926
What is he doing in Rajasthan?

879
01:14:45,166 --> 01:14:48,088
He has come here with his wife
on their honeymoon.

880
01:14:48,288 --> 01:14:49,570
You know how it is.

881
01:14:50,131 --> 01:14:52,412
So what is your zip code?

882
01:14:52,892 --> 01:14:54,695
There is no need for that. I..

883
01:14:55,016 --> 01:14:56,817
I will come and collect it personally.

884
01:15:10,791 --> 01:15:12,592
We have to repair this immediately.

885
01:15:12,792 --> 01:15:14,315
Use more machinery.

886
01:15:15,835 --> 01:15:17,318
What are you saying, Ashwat?

887
01:15:17,957 --> 01:15:19,840
The generators are
already heavily loaded.

888
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:23,243
You know that an overload
can cause a complete blackout.

889
01:15:27,607 --> 01:15:29,730
Focus on our problems,
not on our tone.

890
01:15:30,050 --> 01:15:32,812
The entire mission will be compromised
because of your urgency.

891
01:15:58,156 --> 01:16:00,399
I thought they'd have
a fight over the phone,

892
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:02,841
but she wants to come here.

893
01:16:04,523 --> 01:16:06,685
Daniel, can you hear me?

894
01:16:56,214 --> 01:16:57,615
I have cleaned your room, sir.

895
01:16:57,734 --> 01:16:58,895
Do you need anything else?

896
01:17:00,057 --> 01:17:01,098
No, thank you.

897
01:17:01,258 --> 01:17:02,098
<i>You may leave.</i>

898
01:17:06,143 --> 01:17:07,064
Listen.

899
01:17:09,706 --> 01:17:11,428
-Yes?
-Send me a cup of tea.

900
01:17:12,348 --> 01:17:13,230
Sure.

901
01:17:28,444 --> 01:17:29,406
Any development?

902
01:17:32,809 --> 01:17:34,530
Everybody is very tense, Ashwat.

903
01:17:34,610 --> 01:17:36,292
You're pushing them too much.

904
01:17:36,612 --> 01:17:38,453
Honestly, all of them are
very angry with you, you know.

905
01:17:38,574 --> 01:17:40,456
It doesn’t make a difference to me.

906
01:17:40,817 --> 01:17:42,218
But it does make a
difference to our work.

907
01:17:42,739 --> 01:17:44,700
The issue with the generator is genuine.

908
01:17:45,220 --> 01:17:47,182
<i>You know that the White House</i>
<i>requires a lot of power.</i>

909
01:17:52,227 --> 01:17:53,388
All right, I agree.

910
01:17:53,629 --> 01:17:55,310
So what's your plan?
What do we do?

911
01:17:55,792 --> 01:17:57,433
Okay, let's go step-by-step.

912
01:17:59,876 --> 01:18:00,995
First of all...

913
01:18:10,845 --> 01:18:11,726
You?

914
01:18:13,168 --> 01:18:14,249
What are you doing here?

915
01:18:16,211 --> 01:18:17,772
I should be asking...

916
01:18:36,751 --> 01:18:37,791
His wife is here.

917
01:18:53,447 --> 01:18:54,368
Nakul?

918
01:18:57,290 --> 01:18:59,133
Are you even a little ashamed?

919
01:19:04,738 --> 01:19:05,860
<i>You are mistaken.</i>

920
01:19:05,939 --> 01:19:07,340
<i>I am mistaken?</i>

921
01:19:07,860 --> 01:19:10,544
<i>I had no idea that you'd lie so much.</i>

922
01:19:13,907 --> 01:19:15,990
This is why you didn’t take me
to your college in Delhi.

923
01:19:16,269 --> 01:19:18,872
Forget about a room,
your department doesn’t exist there.

924
01:19:20,753 --> 01:19:21,674
I heard...

925
01:19:35,408 --> 01:19:39,052
We stay by the phone every evening
so that we don’t miss your calls

926
01:19:39,131 --> 01:19:40,813
and you have a personal cell phone!

927
01:19:40,893 --> 01:19:43,376
This is very expensive
and incoming calls are also charged.

928
01:19:50,503 --> 01:19:51,944
What do you use this
expensive phone for?

929
01:19:52,024 --> 01:19:53,505
Na... Nakul?

930
01:19:58,991 --> 01:20:01,112
"The day goes by
but the night doesn't seem to end.

931
01:20:02,195 --> 01:20:03,955
You're not around,
but your memory torments me."

932
01:20:04,036 --> 01:20:05,517
What are you doing?
You'll break it!

933
01:20:05,597 --> 01:20:06,438
You have no idea!

934
01:20:06,557 --> 01:20:08,199
This phone has the pass code
and the time for today's blind spot!

935
01:20:09,921 --> 01:20:11,362
<i>I can't tell you anything more, Sushma.</i>

936
01:20:11,442 --> 01:20:13,084
<i>What can't you tell me?</i>

937
01:20:13,525 --> 01:20:14,765
<i>What can't you tell me?</i>

938
01:20:17,328 --> 01:20:21,933
You can’t tell me...
that you're bored with your mundane life?

939
01:20:23,895 --> 01:20:26,497
I have done so much for you, Ashwat.

940
01:20:27,818 --> 01:20:31,101
I gave you as much love
and respect as I could.

941
01:20:32,023 --> 01:20:35,066
I respected your decision
of not taking up a private job

942
01:20:35,146 --> 01:20:36,347
and stayed up working nights!

943
01:20:46,677 --> 01:20:47,717
How long...

944
01:20:48,157 --> 01:20:49,760
How long has this been going on for?

945
01:20:50,761 --> 01:20:53,724
There is nothing going on, Sushma.
She is my colleague.

946
01:20:56,846 --> 01:20:57,727
Enough.

947
01:20:59,409 --> 01:21:02,092
How can she be your colleague
when you don’t even have a job!

948
01:21:02,172 --> 01:21:03,854
Where do you work together?

949
01:21:03,933 --> 01:21:06,416
Sushma, please listen to me.
Please.

950
01:21:13,422 --> 01:21:14,464
Sushma.

951
01:21:28,238 --> 01:21:29,119
What does it mean?

952
01:21:30,679 --> 01:21:34,643
These guys work when the satellite
does not cover the range.

953
01:21:37,566 --> 01:21:39,689
This is why your CIA was
not able to detect anything.

954
01:21:40,569 --> 01:21:41,730
Call them now.

955
01:22:02,150 --> 01:22:03,311
How did she come here?

956
01:22:03,392 --> 01:22:04,994
I don’t know.
She left before I could find out.

957
01:22:05,914 --> 01:22:07,795
When was the last time
you spoke with her?

958
01:22:09,878 --> 01:22:10,878
Two days ago?

959
01:22:30,337 --> 01:22:31,499
About Prahlad's school.

960
01:22:32,660 --> 01:22:34,301
Did you tell her
the location by mistake?

961
01:22:43,270 --> 01:22:46,112
We need to find out
how Sushma got this address.

962
01:23:03,610 --> 01:23:04,572
What happened?

963
01:23:24,871 --> 01:23:28,074
I had told you
that the generators might get overloaded.

964
01:23:28,154 --> 01:23:29,755
And I had asked you to deal with it.

965
01:23:29,955 --> 01:23:31,637
Why don’t you tell me what you want?

966
01:23:31,718 --> 01:23:33,158
Arranging for it is my problem.

967
01:23:34,441 --> 01:23:35,641
I need time.

968
01:23:39,805 --> 01:23:41,447
Things are not going well for me.

969
01:23:42,647 --> 01:23:44,810
We have been married for 11 years.

970
01:23:46,211 --> 01:23:48,934
And she made such a
big accusation today.

971
01:23:49,734 --> 01:23:50,856
This is a setup.

972
01:23:51,336 --> 01:23:54,740
She was sent here so that they could
get more information on this mission.

973
01:24:01,386 --> 01:24:02,387
It's fixed.

974
01:24:02,747 --> 01:24:03,748
Come on, start your work.

975
01:24:07,432 --> 01:24:08,873
There is a satellite overhead.

976
01:24:32,096 --> 01:24:33,537
It could’ve been a plane.

977
01:24:38,823 --> 01:24:40,184
I had seen it as well, sir.

978
01:24:46,230 --> 01:24:48,072
Satellites travel like this.

979
01:24:48,272 --> 01:24:50,835
And planes, like this.
What did it look like?

980
01:24:52,196 --> 01:24:53,998
Another satellite was added
at the last minute.

981
01:24:54,397 --> 01:24:56,159
That was close.
Thank God for the power failure.

982
01:24:57,761 --> 01:25:00,764
Sushma's arrival,
the last minute adding of a satellite.

983
01:25:01,284 --> 01:25:03,326
What is the duration of
our blind spot now?

984
01:25:04,568 --> 01:25:05,808
Less than an hour.

985
01:25:07,290 --> 01:25:08,251
At night?

986
01:25:08,451 --> 01:25:09,572
In the whole day.

987
01:25:09,772 --> 01:25:11,455
Just one hour's blind spot?

988
01:25:12,134 --> 01:25:14,017
It takes an hour just
to cover up our tracks.

989
01:25:21,624 --> 01:25:23,907
Send the stores back immediately.

990
01:25:24,147 --> 01:25:25,948
Don’t leave any paper trail behind.

991
01:25:27,270 --> 01:25:30,553
And release everyone from their duties.

992
01:26:06,146 --> 01:26:08,030
Finally, some appreciation!

993
01:26:12,874 --> 01:26:15,236
So, it's back to normal life
from tomorrow.

994
01:26:15,676 --> 01:26:17,118
For the rest of you, yes.

995
01:26:18,399 --> 01:26:21,282
My personal and professional lives,
both end with this mission.

996
01:26:21,802 --> 01:26:23,445
We could not conduct the tests.

997
01:26:24,045 --> 01:26:25,806
What will I tell Sushma now?

998
01:26:26,086 --> 01:26:27,448
What was I doing here?

999
01:26:28,329 --> 01:26:29,849
What is there to tell?

1000
01:26:33,414 --> 01:26:34,775
It’s strange that
she came to Pokhran

1001
01:26:34,855 --> 01:26:36,456
and couldn’t connect it
to nuclear testing.

1002
01:26:36,537 --> 01:26:38,138
It is not her fault.

1003
01:26:39,499 --> 01:26:42,222
Sometimes, we get so blinded by suspicion

1004
01:26:42,302 --> 01:26:45,305
that we fail to see
what's right in front of us.

1005
01:26:45,825 --> 01:26:46,908
What did you say?

1006
01:26:49,789 --> 01:26:50,750
What?

1007
01:26:51,191 --> 01:26:52,111
What did I say?

1008
01:26:52,192 --> 01:26:55,114
Sometimes, we get so blinded by suspicion

1009
01:26:55,275 --> 01:26:58,518
that we fail to see
what's right in front of us.

1010
01:27:06,245 --> 01:27:07,287
Pass me the water.

1011
01:27:19,498 --> 01:27:21,020
Just listen to me once.

1012
01:27:21,180 --> 01:27:23,823
The satellites can be made to
move away from Pokhran and our range.

1013
01:27:23,903 --> 01:27:24,904
It's very simple.

1014
01:27:24,983 --> 01:27:27,907
You just have to get your strongest
sources to leak the information

1015
01:27:27,986 --> 01:27:32,030
that India might attack Pakistan
over the Kashmir issue.

1016
01:27:36,515 --> 01:27:38,517
And you know America.

1017
01:27:38,836 --> 01:27:42,521
As soon as they learn of our intention
to attack from the LOC,

1018
01:27:42,601 --> 01:27:44,443
they will change the position
of their satellites.

1019
01:27:44,523 --> 01:27:45,483
They will move their satellites.

1020
01:27:45,564 --> 01:27:48,086
We'll conduct our tests
right under their noses.

1021
01:27:48,166 --> 01:27:51,530
But for that, we need to get the army
to make mock movements at the LOC.

1022
01:27:54,932 --> 01:27:58,135
You want me to create a
warlike situation in our country?

1023
01:28:02,901 --> 01:28:03,822
Yes, sir.

1024
01:28:21,959 --> 01:28:23,601
<i>The Indian Army has</i>

1025
01:28:23,681 --> 01:28:26,844
<i>increased their personnel</i>
<i>in Kashmir over the last few days.</i>

1026
01:28:27,885 --> 01:28:31,648
<i>This show of strength from</i>
<i>India has disturbed Pakistan.</i>

1027
01:28:32,049 --> 01:28:33,931
<i>The Pakistani Prime Minister,</i>
<i>Mr. Nawaz Sharif</i>

1028
01:28:34,010 --> 01:28:36,414
<i>is afraid that India</i>
<i>might attack the LOC any day.</i>

1029
01:28:48,105 --> 01:28:50,747
<i>America has offered to mediate</i>

1030
01:28:50,828 --> 01:28:52,588
<i>so that the growing tension in</i>
<i>Kashmir can be resolved.</i>

1031
01:29:05,762 --> 01:29:08,604
<i>Assume not that you will</i>
<i>win Kashmir away from India</i>

1032
01:29:08,684 --> 01:29:11,527
<i>with your jihad,</i>
<i>your weapons and your threats</i>

1033
01:29:11,607 --> 01:29:14,530
<i>Assume not you will</i>
<i>make India bow its head</i>

1034
01:29:14,610 --> 01:29:16,933
<i>in the face of your assaults</i>
<i>and your injustices</i>

1035
01:29:17,012 --> 01:29:18,174
Sir, please.

1036
01:29:18,333 --> 01:29:20,056
Sir!

1037
01:29:21,937 --> 01:29:24,379
We know how to defend our country.

1038
01:29:24,700 --> 01:29:26,262
We don’t want war.

1039
01:29:28,743 --> 01:29:29,745
We will not retreat.

1040
01:30:18,072 --> 01:30:19,714
We have to leave Pokhran.

1041
01:30:33,567 --> 01:30:35,088
There were transmitters in your room.

1042
01:30:35,248 --> 01:30:37,731
I have got some leads
near Khetolai village.

1043
01:30:37,971 --> 01:30:41,094
There are some local spies because
of whom the mission was compromised.

1044
01:30:44,257 --> 01:30:46,179
Why don’t you remove the
security from the guesthouse now?

1045
01:30:46,740 --> 01:30:48,101
What’s your issue with security?

1046
01:30:49,863 --> 01:30:51,063
We have new blind spots now.

1047
01:30:52,105 --> 01:30:53,147
How much time will we get?

1048
01:30:53,226 --> 01:30:54,266
Eight hours!

1049
01:30:55,228 --> 01:30:56,709
Eight hours over the next three days?

1050
01:30:58,952 --> 01:31:01,393
-To seal the shafts...
-Eight hours, every night...

1051
01:31:02,955 --> 01:31:04,637
For the next three days.

1052
01:31:05,277 --> 01:31:07,079
That means 24 man-hours.

1053
01:31:08,361 --> 01:31:10,523
Mr. Naresh, is that time enough for you?

1054
01:31:11,203 --> 01:31:13,365
We have laid all the cables.

1055
01:31:14,006 --> 01:31:15,969
We just need to make
the final connections.

1056
01:31:17,330 --> 01:31:20,773
But immediately, after these tests,
the whole world will descend upon us.

1057
01:31:21,253 --> 01:31:22,735
There will be a lot of criticism.

1058
01:31:23,576 --> 01:31:24,576
Mr. Naresh.

1059
01:31:25,858 --> 01:31:27,900
Please don’t think
about the world.

1060
01:31:29,302 --> 01:31:31,623
We are standing at a juncture

1061
01:31:32,184 --> 01:31:34,546
from where we can change
the future of this country.

1062
01:31:36,348 --> 01:31:38,309
Our abilities will be put to test.

1063
01:31:39,391 --> 01:31:42,114
We will never seem
to have enough time.

1064
01:31:43,194 --> 01:31:44,956
We will not sleep for
the next three nights.

1065
01:31:45,878 --> 01:31:48,359
So that we can give our enemies
sleepless nights.

1066
01:31:50,601 --> 01:31:52,604
We should not think about the outcome.

1067
01:31:53,965 --> 01:31:55,967
We should carry out
our plans as intended.

1068
01:31:58,009 --> 01:32:02,654
I don’t know...
if the world will praise us or not.

1069
01:32:03,894 --> 01:32:05,177
But I am sure that...

1070
01:32:06,337 --> 01:32:09,020
when we look at ourselves in the mirror,
we will proudly say that...

1071
01:32:10,301 --> 01:32:14,345
we made the plans for the country.

1072
01:32:15,787 --> 01:32:19,349
We executed the actions for the country...

1073
01:32:20,831 --> 01:32:25,075
and the result we achieved
belongs to the country.

1074
01:32:26,317 --> 01:32:31,241
<i>My motherland!</i>

1075
01:32:31,361 --> 01:32:34,524
<i>My soul is painted</i>

1076
01:32:34,604 --> 01:32:36,726
<i>My soul is painted</i>

1077
01:32:48,218 --> 01:32:53,503
<i>My country is my love, my pride</i>

1078
01:32:53,703 --> 01:32:57,946
<i>The skies above surrender before it</i>

1079
01:32:58,027 --> 01:33:02,392
<i>My country is my love, my pride</i>

1080
01:33:02,472 --> 01:33:06,115
<i>The skies above surrender before it</i>

1081
01:33:06,235 --> 01:33:07,596
<i>My soul is painted</i>

1082
01:33:08,238 --> 01:33:10,399
<i>My soul is painted</i>

1083
01:33:10,479 --> 01:33:14,443
<i>My soul is painted in the saffron hue</i>

1084
01:33:14,522 --> 01:33:18,928
{\an8}<i>My soul is painted in the saffron hue</i>

1085
01:33:19,008 --> 01:33:23,251
<i>My soul is painted in the saffron hue</i>

1086
01:33:23,332 --> 01:33:27,855
<i>My soul is painted in the saffron hue</i>

1087
01:33:28,777 --> 01:33:33,141
<i>I can fight with the whole world</i>

1088
01:33:33,222 --> 01:33:38,827
<i>To uphold the honor of my country</i>

1089
01:33:40,948 --> 01:33:45,194
<i>My soul is painted in the saffron hue</i>

1090
01:33:45,273 --> 01:33:49,637
<i>My soul is painted in the saffron hue</i>

1091
01:33:49,717 --> 01:33:54,041
<i>My soul is painted in the saffron hue</i>

1092
01:33:54,162 --> 01:33:58,487
<i>My soul is painted in the saffron hue</i>

1093
01:34:18,225 --> 01:34:22,430
<i>The world will respect us</i>
<i>Such is our determination</i>

1094
01:34:22,549 --> 01:34:26,794
<i>We will strive to fulfill our promise</i>

1095
01:34:26,994 --> 01:34:31,278
<i>The world will respect us</i>
<i>Such is our determination</i>

1096
01:34:31,399 --> 01:34:35,763
<i>We will strive to fulfill our promise</i>

1097
01:34:35,842 --> 01:34:40,126
{\an8}<i>We have no fear</i>
<i>Our resolve is strong</i>

1098
01:34:40,206 --> 01:34:44,932
{\an8}<i>Nothing can stop us now</i>

1099
01:34:45,011 --> 01:34:46,533
{\an8}<i>My soul is painted</i>

1100
01:34:46,613 --> 01:34:49,255
{\an8}<i>My soul is painted</i>

1101
01:34:49,336 --> 01:34:53,299
{\an8}<i>My soul is painted in the saffron hue</i>

1102
01:35:07,673 --> 01:35:11,598
<i>I can fight with the whole world</i>

1103
01:35:12,037 --> 01:35:14,601
<i>To uphold the honor of my country</i>

1104
01:35:14,680 --> 01:35:15,721
What happened now?

1105
01:35:19,885 --> 01:35:23,809
<i>My soul is painted in the saffron hue</i>

1106
01:35:23,888 --> 01:35:25,771
The store has reached
the White House canteen.

1107
01:35:27,411 --> 01:35:29,694
Which one?
The one with the hydrogen bomb?

1108
01:35:29,775 --> 01:35:31,737
<i>Sir, please use code language.</i>

1109
01:35:32,257 --> 01:35:33,578
This is a secure line, Ashwat.

1110
01:35:34,980 --> 01:35:36,981
Otherwise,
I'll press the trigger right now.

1111
01:35:43,388 --> 01:35:44,790
It's time to seal the shafts.

1112
01:35:55,560 --> 01:36:01,086
<i>My soul is painted</i>

1113
01:36:05,730 --> 01:36:08,413
<i>The warlike situation</i>
<i>at the border continues.</i>

1114
01:36:08,492 --> 01:36:11,175
<i>America and the entire world</i>
<i>have their eyes on Kashmir now.</i>

1115
01:36:11,255 --> 01:36:12,936
America is being fooled.

1116
01:36:13,938 --> 01:36:15,299
They refuse to listen to us.

1117
01:36:19,823 --> 01:36:21,025
Hey, get some onions.

1118
01:36:21,465 --> 01:36:23,387
-There aren’t any.
-Why?

1119
01:36:23,466 --> 01:36:24,868
It has become very expensive.

1120
01:36:25,029 --> 01:36:26,149
I will pay you extra.

1121
01:36:26,229 --> 01:36:28,351
What will I do with your money
when there are no onions?

1122
01:36:28,472 --> 01:36:29,793
The army has taken it all.

1123
01:36:29,913 --> 01:36:30,754
What do you mean?

1124
01:36:30,874 --> 01:36:32,715
They have taken truckloads of onions
to the army canteen.

1125
01:36:32,876 --> 01:36:34,678
There are no onions in
the entire city of Jaisalmer.

1126
01:36:39,242 --> 01:36:40,403
I've got the proof.

1127
01:36:41,084 --> 01:36:42,686
-What proof?
-Onions.

1128
01:36:43,807 --> 01:36:46,609
Onions. They absorb radiation.

1129
01:36:47,130 --> 01:36:48,731
I am sure they will conduct the test soon.

1130
01:36:48,811 --> 01:36:50,613
Call up the CIA.

1131
01:36:55,858 --> 01:36:58,541
Your informer in Pokhran got caught.

1132
01:37:04,067 --> 01:37:04,988
Daniel, you...

1133
01:37:13,434 --> 01:37:16,518
{\an8}<i>I don’t think mama will</i>
<i>speak to you today as well.</i>

1134
01:37:17,279 --> 01:37:18,640
{\an8}<i>How are you?</i>

1135
01:37:21,603 --> 01:37:24,446
Mama always gives you a pep talk
before your exams, doesn't she?

1136
01:37:26,568 --> 01:37:27,810
I also have an exam today.

1137
01:37:29,210 --> 01:37:30,292
Are you sure she won't talk to me?

1138
01:37:30,612 --> 01:37:32,134
<i>She won't, Papa.</i>

1139
01:37:32,374 --> 01:37:36,857
Have yogurt and sugar.
Mom always gives you that, right?

1140
01:38:14,655 --> 01:38:15,536
You?

1141
01:38:15,975 --> 01:38:17,137
I am not a waiter.

1142
01:38:17,458 --> 01:38:18,899
Give me your phone.

1143
01:38:20,541 --> 01:38:23,302
You won’t be able
to conduct the tests

1144
01:38:23,464 --> 01:38:24,985
for which you have
been making preparations.

1145
01:38:25,065 --> 01:38:26,626
The tests... are done.

1146
01:38:26,987 --> 01:38:28,108
What do you mean they're done?

1147
01:38:28,188 --> 01:38:29,548
Look at that painting.

1148
01:38:29,749 --> 01:38:32,112
It has unhinged
because of the aftershocks.

1149
01:38:42,722 --> 01:38:45,644
<i>My youth has stirred</i>

1150
01:38:45,765 --> 01:38:48,768
<i>You rekindled my desire</i>

1151
01:38:49,128 --> 01:38:51,971
<i>I want to get engaged to you</i>

1152
01:38:52,572 --> 01:38:54,934
<i>Make me your wife</i>

1153
01:38:55,054 --> 01:38:58,858
<i>My heart cries for you</i>
<i>Come to me</i>

1154
01:39:49,828 --> 01:39:51,388
Give me the phone or I will shoot.

1155
01:39:51,469 --> 01:39:52,509
The gun’s locked.

1156
01:39:56,514 --> 01:39:57,675
The phone’s locked too.

1157
01:40:12,810 --> 01:40:14,291
Come on, hurry up.

1158
01:40:37,514 --> 01:40:38,394
Students.

1159
01:40:38,474 --> 01:40:41,637
Today, I will teach you about
the importance of nonviolence.

1160
01:41:01,617 --> 01:41:03,939
Hey, put the gun down.

1161
01:41:04,179 --> 01:41:05,060
Sir, please listen to me.

1162
01:41:05,140 --> 01:41:06,622
Arrest him. Look at the board.

1163
01:41:08,303 --> 01:41:09,785
Put the gun down first.

1164
01:41:09,866 --> 01:41:11,306
Sir, this is not my gun.

1165
01:41:11,386 --> 01:41:12,748
Put it down!

1166
01:41:12,829 --> 01:41:14,309
It's locked anyway, see!

1167
01:41:25,320 --> 01:41:27,602
Sir, we can't wait.
We have to conduct the test right now.

1168
01:41:27,682 --> 01:41:29,885
He was a Pakistani spy
and he has my phone.

1169
01:41:29,965 --> 01:41:31,686
You know it has so much vital information.

1170
01:41:31,766 --> 01:41:33,928
Ashwat, calm down.
I am on my way to the PMO.

1171
01:41:34,529 --> 01:41:35,690
<i>I'll send you a fax as soon</i>

1172
01:41:35,770 --> 01:41:37,131
<i>as I get the Prime Minister's permission,</i>
<i>all right?</i>

1173
01:41:37,212 --> 01:41:38,212
Satpal, drive faster.

1174
01:41:38,292 --> 01:41:39,975
What is the point
of having a red beacon?

1175
01:41:40,054 --> 01:41:41,055
Defense Residential Complex

1176
01:41:43,898 --> 01:41:46,261
-It was this guy, right?
-Yes, it was him. I told him.

1177
01:41:46,461 --> 01:41:47,741
Aren’t you ashamed?

1178
01:41:48,022 --> 01:41:50,305
The suspect was right in front of you
and you let him go!

1179
01:41:51,466 --> 01:41:52,305
You may leave, Ashwat.

1180
01:41:52,907 --> 01:41:54,868
-All right.
-Take him to the range.

1181
01:41:54,949 --> 01:41:55,830
Yes, madam.

1182
01:42:04,958 --> 01:42:06,080
I've got the proof.

1183
01:42:27,260 --> 01:42:29,223
You know me!
I come here every day.

1184
01:42:29,302 --> 01:42:30,983
I don’t have my phone
and I don’t remember the pass code.

1185
01:42:32,145 --> 01:42:33,547
I give you the pass code every day.

1186
01:42:33,626 --> 01:42:35,107
It's very urgent today, please.

1187
01:42:35,227 --> 01:42:37,070
Sorry, sir.
You have to tell me the pass code.

1188
01:42:37,149 --> 01:42:38,230
You are the one who made this rule.

1189
01:42:47,640 --> 01:42:49,162
Kavita, is the Prime Minister in?

1190
01:42:49,282 --> 01:42:50,563
Sir, what are you doing here?

1191
01:42:50,643 --> 01:42:52,325
The Prime Minister has a meeting

1192
01:42:52,405 --> 01:42:54,767
with the American diplomats
at Ashoka Hotel.

1193
01:42:59,772 --> 01:43:00,773
Was it one line?

1194
01:43:00,973 --> 01:43:01,854
Two.

1195
01:43:02,735 --> 01:43:04,296
Love is...

1196
01:43:04,696 --> 01:43:08,459
Love is not easy.
Love isn't easy, bear that in mind.

1197
01:43:10,783 --> 01:43:12,865
-You know the rest.
-No, sir.

1198
01:43:12,945 --> 01:43:14,546
You will have to tell me the entire thing.

1199
01:43:17,309 --> 01:43:20,312
Love isn't easy, bear that in mind.

1200
01:43:20,391 --> 01:43:22,914
It is a river of fire
and you have to swim through it.

1201
01:43:23,876 --> 01:43:24,956
You may enter, sir.

1202
01:43:25,917 --> 01:43:28,399
Ma'am, we have tracked
the location of Ashwat's cell phone.

1203
01:43:28,480 --> 01:43:30,602
-What is the location?
-Kotwal Haveli, Jaisalmer.

1204
01:43:53,184 --> 01:43:57,667
The Prime Minister is set
to have a meeting

1205
01:43:57,748 --> 01:44:01,952
with the American diplomats
on the rising tension in Kashmir.

1206
01:44:02,873 --> 01:44:05,195
-What's going on?
-The meeting started five minutes ago.

1207
01:44:05,316 --> 01:44:07,037
The Prime Minister was asking about you.

1208
01:44:14,925 --> 01:44:16,126
Sir, did you get the permission?

1209
01:44:18,528 --> 01:44:20,931
The Prime Minister's meeting with
the American diplomats has started.

1210
01:44:21,010 --> 01:44:22,773
But sir,
that will take a couple of hours.

1211
01:44:22,853 --> 01:44:25,375
I cannot bring this up
in front of the Americans!

1212
01:45:59,827 --> 01:46:00,708
Open the door.

1213
01:46:18,365 --> 01:46:19,205
Your Excellency.

1214
01:46:27,573 --> 01:46:29,015
What is this?
The PMO has sent the wrong fax.

1215
01:46:48,755 --> 01:46:50,115
White House refers to the shafts.

1216
01:46:51,317 --> 01:46:52,678
Store refers to the bombs.

1217
01:47:18,223 --> 01:47:19,063
What is wrong?

1218
01:47:21,947 --> 01:47:23,868
Ashwat, the wind is
directed towards Pakistan.

1219
01:47:24,108 --> 01:47:25,990
In case there is a radiation leak,
it will cause severe damage there.

1220
01:47:26,070 --> 01:47:26,951
We have to wait.

1221
01:47:54,979 --> 01:47:56,259
Let's go ahead, Prem.

1222
01:47:56,339 --> 01:47:57,502
We can't, sir.

1223
01:48:21,885 --> 01:48:22,765
Stop.

1224
01:48:23,846 --> 01:48:24,648
Stop.

1225
01:48:51,273 --> 01:48:52,234
The wind has stopped.

1226
01:51:48,965 --> 01:51:52,769
Long live India!

1227
01:51:53,971 --> 01:51:56,533
<i>The ground trembles</i>
<i>As we stride ahead</i>

1228
01:51:56,613 --> 01:51:59,215
<i>There is no stopping us now</i>

1229
01:51:59,295 --> 01:52:01,858
<i>Fulfilling our duties</i>
<i>With our heads held high</i>

1230
01:52:01,938 --> 01:52:04,420
<i>We refuse to bow down</i>

1231
01:52:04,541 --> 01:52:08,464
<i>We refuse to bow down</i>

1232
01:52:10,067 --> 01:52:13,349
<i>My motherland</i>

1233
01:52:15,031 --> 01:52:18,955
<i>My motherland</i>

1234
01:52:31,566 --> 01:52:36,852
<i>I am blessed to get the chance</i>

1235
01:52:36,933 --> 01:52:41,656
<i>To dedicate my life to you</i>

1236
01:52:42,257 --> 01:52:47,463
<i>I pray, mother, to serve you first</i>

1237
01:52:47,543 --> 01:52:52,347
<i>Whenever you might call</i>

1238
01:52:52,708 --> 01:52:57,793
<i>For you, my motherland</i>

1239
01:52:57,913 --> 01:53:01,076
<i>I shall lay down my life for you</i>

1240
01:53:03,319 --> 01:53:07,002
<i>For you, my motherland</i>

1241
01:53:08,683 --> 01:53:11,366
<i>I will leave no stone unturned</i>

1242
01:53:42,596 --> 01:53:43,477
Ashwat.

1243
01:53:50,443 --> 01:53:52,125
I will inform the Prime Minister.

1244
01:53:57,770 --> 01:53:59,493
<i>With the success of</i>
<i>the nuclear testing in Pokhran</i>

1245
01:53:59,573 --> 01:54:01,334
<i>India has not only made history</i>

1246
01:54:01,495 --> 01:54:04,057
<i>but it has also laid the foundation</i>
<i>for a bright future.</i>

1247
01:54:15,147 --> 01:54:18,030
<i>Indians are in a celebratory mood today</i>

1248
01:54:18,230 --> 01:54:19,913
<i>while America and a few other countries</i>

1249
01:54:19,993 --> 01:54:21,673
<i>are suffering from shock and bewilderment.</i>

1250
01:54:41,999 --> 01:54:44,000
I couldn’t tell you earlier.
