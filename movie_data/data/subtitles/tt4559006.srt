1
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:09,580
- Mic check...

2
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:12,830
- Sounds good... Checking focus.

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:13,830
- Roll sound!

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,240
- Ready, Ayan?

5
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:17,330
Yeah.

6
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:19,080
- Great... Let's start!

7
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:22,120
- So... The reclusive Ayan Sanger!

8
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:24,620
5 years... 4 big songs...

9
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:28,080
...all hits and all non-film!
Congratulations!

10
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,780
Thanks... and thanks to all of you.

11
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,910
- The lyrics of your
songs are by a certain...

12
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:35,660
- Saba Taliyar Khan...

13
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,740
- ...and she's a lesser
known poet, right?

14
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:40,780
We had a very special relationship...

15
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:42,870
- Past tense! And now?

16
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:44,870
She's a really good friend...

17
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:50,580
- And all your songs hint at
unrequited loved... Does that mean...

18
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:53,620
No, no, no...
My love isn't unfulfilled...

19
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,280
- And still... unrequited?

20
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:01,120
I'd only heard of the
power of one-sided love...

21
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:03,080
Now I understand it.

22
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:05,700
Does this love have a name?

23
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:53,120
What kind of hug was that?!

24
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:56,990
- Means?
- 'Mmmmm'!

25
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:59,910
I wasn't aware that
hugs had standards.

26
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:03,780
Listen... Save these sentimental
hugs for your family...

27
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:06,240
....not girls you're hooking up with!

28
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:09,620
And what was that kiss!

29
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:13,240
Excuse me!

30
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:16,160
All my ex-girlfriends say
I'm a great kisser!

31
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:19,870
Really... People will say
anything these days...

32
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:23,160
Great kisser...
what kind of guy are you?

33
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:27,120
A guilty one...

34
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,700
Guilty?

35
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:29,950
Why?

36
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:31,990
I have a girlfriend...

37
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:34,330
So? I've got a boyfriend.

38
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:36,490
And you're not guilty?

39
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,490
Look... boyfriends are like movies...

40
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:44,200
Some flops... some blockbusters!

41
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:47,410
And Dr. Faisal was
chosen by my father...

42
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:50,370
Won't take too long to flop.

43
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:53,740
Anyway...

44
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:56,030
This was...

45
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:57,950
Alright...

46
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,530
No, no... It's...done.

47
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,740
Sure?

48
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:02,160
Definitely!

49
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,280
Nice meeting you...

50
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,780
Bye!

51
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:13,330
Are you following me?

52
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,030
I don't know anyone here...

53
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:18,120
What do you want me to do?

54
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:21,120
Take you around like a tour guide?

55
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:25,740
"Hello, Party! Meet Hugh Heffner...
world's best kisser!"'

56
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:27,280
Hello!

57
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:29,410
What's with the attitude?

58
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,120
Hello hello hello!

59
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:41,410
Did you feel bad?!

60
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,700
Why so touchy, baby?

61
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,950
Just... Fought with my girlfriend.

62
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,080
I fought with my boyfriend, too!

63
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:55,990
Just two lost souls
swimming in a fish bowl!

64
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:57,740
Filmy!

65
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:00,370
Totally! Why'd you guys fight?

66
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,870
If I tell you, you'll judge me...

67
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,530
Oh, I've already judged
you with that 'kiss'.

68
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:08,990
- Just tell me!

69
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:11,330
So... we were late for this party...

70
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:16,450
...so when I saw Lisa, I asked her why
she hadn't worn her clothes, yet...

71
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:19,370
And she said...
"I'm already dressed!

72
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:20,990
No way!
Short or skimpy?

73
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,530
Both! She showed up
in a bikini, I swear!

74
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,660
Man... It's up to her!

75
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:29,330
You stink of male chauvinism!

76
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,370
Are you saying it's my fault?!

77
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,740
I know too many boys like you!

78
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:35,700
You're so judgmental!

79
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,830
Happily judgmental!

80
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,280
Now... If you're done,
can we get out of here?

81
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:41,450
Where to?

82
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:42,580
Bar hopping!

83
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:43,490
With me?

84
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:44,780
Well, I'm not going alone!

85
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,280
Okay, let's go!

86
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:47,530
Let's go!

87
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:49,280
We haven't been properly introduced!

88
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:52,780
My name is Alizeh Khan...
Khan, and I'm not a terrorist!

89
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,200
Rahul...

90
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,330
...like in "Kuch Kuch Hota Hai"'.

91
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:00,370
Are you joking or
is that really your name?

92
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:01,870
It was a joke!

93
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:03,660
I don't like jokes!

94
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,200
I don't like you!

95
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,280
Name?

96
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:10,990
Ayan... Ayan Sanger.

97
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:14,780
Ayan Sanger...
It's the time to disco!

98
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:58,240
- Look! My girlfriend's apologizing!

99
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:01,950
She's apologizing?

100
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,240
Yeah... I feel bad...

101
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,330
How rich are you?

102
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,830
What does that have
to do with anything?

103
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:13,740
Well, it's not because
of your good looks, is it?

104
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:15,410
- Yes!
- Sure...

105
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:19,330
So... you're rich, right?

106
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:23,080
Yeah... I'm rich.

107
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:25,370
First Class or Private Jet?

108
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:29,910
Private Jet...

109
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:31,530
I knew it!

110
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:34,160
She's a gold-digger!

111
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,330
Are you poor?

112
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,450
Well, my father's rich...
I'm wealthy. Big difference.

113
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:43,780
What's the difference?

114
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,120
I'm the 4th of 4 daughters...

115
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:54,700
Youngest kids usually get
the most love, but not in my family...

116
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,490
My mom left me when I was 2.

117
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:00,370
What?

118
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:02,030
She ran away.

119
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:06,280
Mothers are like Teresa...
yours is Usain Bolt!

120
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:11,530
My mom...

121
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:14,370
I'm so sorry...
That's wrong...

122
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:16,080
Why did she leave?

123
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:22,120
I was never allowed to ask...

124
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,200
Now...

125
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:25,450
What difference does it make?

126
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,530
You must be close to your dad, right?

127
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:29,660
Yeah...

128
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,200
What do you do
in London, anyway?

129
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:51,700
M.B.A!

130
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:54,120
You don't look the
the business type!

131
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:58,120
Another one of your Daddy's dreams?

132
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:00,620
Don't you have a dream of your own?

133
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:03,490
I...

134
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,530
What? Is it illegal?

135
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:06,910
I want to sing.

136
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:08,740
Sing!

137
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:14,160
But my voice won't help
my father's company... so...

138
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:15,740
Sink it, maybe!

139
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:17,240
- Hey!
- Sorry...

140
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:23,490
I sing really well. Lots of people
think I sing like Mohammed Rafi...

141
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:24,950
Shall I sing for you?

142
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,990
What did I ever do to you?

143
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:30,530
And doesn't Mohammed Rafi
always sound like he's crying?

144
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,990
What's better than crying?

145
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:35,950
I'm not a fan...

146
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:39,780
And not of laughing, either!
I take the road less taken...

147
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:41,580
Which is?

148
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,080
Life.

149
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:46,700
- You talk like you’re Amitabh Bachchan!
- I wish!

150
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,330
Do you do anything but talk?

151
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:54,580
Or do you rip apart
men's ego's for a living?

152
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:56,620
Please... I'm really busy!

153
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:00,200
Sometimes I do yoga...

154
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,580
Buddhist chanting...
I'm learning French...

155
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,580
Bollywood Dance class,
sometimes...

156
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:07,530
Like the wind,
I'm everywhere...

157
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:11,240
My name is registered
in any and every course.

158
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:13,830
But this register
has someone else's name.

159
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:14,870
Who's Ali?

160
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:15,950
Nobody.

161
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,120
Hello, Ali... Who you?

162
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:20,530
Let me go, he's no one!

163
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,240
- Look, the train is here.
- Who is Ali?

164
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,830
Who is Ali?

165
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:31,120
My apocalypse.

166
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:35,660
I was studying in Lucknow
when I first met Ali...

167
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,450
The sexy, smouldering, deep DJ Ali...

168
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:42,370
It was like music
was a part of his soul...

169
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:47,120
He was as absorbed in his music...
as I was in him.

170
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:53,740
I thought we were in love...
he never bothered to correct me.

171
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:59,160
But, in truth,
he was the love of my life...

172
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,240
...and I was just his habit.

173
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,030
So, what happened?

174
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,450
What could happen?
He found another habit...

175
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,830
Decided that was love.

176
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:13,530
She was this goddamned
beautiful airhostess...

177
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:18,030
She showed him where
her emergency exits were...

178
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,740
...and that was that.

179
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:25,280
And me and my broken
heart found our way to London.

180
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,740
But you still love him?

181
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,530
That question makes me feel weak...

182
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:39,910
So thank God for Dr. Faisal...

183
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,700
At least he's nice to look at...

184
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,780
- Great distraction!

185
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:50,330
My Lisa is very, very hot.

186
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,530
What do you mean 'very hot'?

187
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:58,160
Very hot.

188
00:11:58,370 --> 00:11:59,450
Wanna bet?

189
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:00,830
Bet what?

190
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:04,120
Come on...
I bet mine's hotter than yours.

191
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,120
Done! Double date... tomorrow night?

192
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,030
It's on.

193
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,120
What if I win?

194
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:15,660
Then I'll let you kiss me again...

195
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:17,780
But you won't win!

196
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,240
Shall we?
I'm very drunk...

197
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,530
Listen! Don't puke or anything!

198
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:29,620
No no no I'm okay, I'm okay!

199
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:34,330
- You didn't have to do that!
- Where are we?

200
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,080
This! This is my happy place.

201
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:41,620
I come here when the
world gets too much...

202
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,370
...when I want to
spend time with myself...

203
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:48,830
Because this is the only place
on earth that knows...

204
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,450
Love is crooked.

205
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:52,370
Crooked!

206
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:57,450
I'll make you an
offer you can't refuse.

207
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:02,490
I see... Can you offer me
your address?

208
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:29,120
- Wine?
- Yes, please.

209
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,240
Two, please.

210
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:33,160
Hi! I'm looking for Alizeh Khan...

211
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:58,700
Hi!

212
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:03,700
Doctor Faisal!

213
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,120
Alizeh...

214
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,080
Lisa!

215
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,200
Hi guys!

216
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:14,280
I'm Lisa D'souza,
but you can call me Lisa.

217
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:19,660
That’s your first name...
what else would we call you?

218
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,200
Exactly!

219
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,530
Your last names are Khan, right?

220
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:26,950
"Cuz I've been practicing
this all day long.

221
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,200
Here, honey, hold my bag...

222
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:31,700
1 ... 2... 3... you ready?

223
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:34,330
AssalamoAlaikum!

224
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:40,870
Waalequm Salaam...

225
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,410
Was that good?

226
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,280
That was good, right?

227
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:45,450
Great...

228
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:48,330
And what... No Namaste for us?

229
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:49,780
Okay! The table's ready!

230
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:56,450
You look ill...

231
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,620
Do you have the flu?

232
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:03,080
'Cuz it's kind of in the air...

233
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,080
No, I'm alright.

234
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:06,830
Alizeh...

235
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,950
I never asked...
How do you two know each other?

236
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,120
We're family friends.

237
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:17,830
Oh, but we're family friends...
I've never met him...

238
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:21,330
Well... He's my friend's family...

239
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:22,990
So... family friends!

240
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:24,620
Honey, see...

241
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:29,030
It's amazing...
how we're all so connected!

242
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,620
How long have you'll been together?

243
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:37,620
How long has it been?

244
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:40,950
Honey!

245
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:44,240
Tomorrow is our
one-month anniversary!

246
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:46,870
Happy anniversary...

247
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:49,330
How sweet!
Where'd you meet?

248
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,330
- Gym!
- Online!

249
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:53,740
Gym.

250
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:55,870
It's a gym called 'Online'...
really good...

251
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:59,910
Yeah, and he was so cute...

252
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:03,620
He saw me going into the sauna...
and he started singing...

253
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:07,620
"Feeling hot, hot, hot!

254
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,450
Adorable...

255
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:10,910
And you guys?

256
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:15,580
Well, our fathers are
very dear to one another...

257
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:19,410
Why not turn such
a close bond into family?

258
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:22,950
Wow... Urdu is so exotic...

259
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,780
Like French... but not French!

260
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,370
Because it's Urdu?

261
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:28,780
Exactly!

262
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:35,200
Hindi's beautiful, too...

263
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:39,870
Only when Mr. Bachchan speaks
on Who Wants to be a Millionaire!

264
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,030
She loves that show...

265
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,530
Yeah, I love it!
He totally nails Hindi!

266
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:49,200
He used this word once...

267
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:51,030
'Vaatavaran'!

268
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,870
And I was like, "'Oh my God!

269
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,740
I love that word!
What does it mean?

270
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:58,780
Ayan said it means...

271
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,580
"'Vibe"!

272
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:04,080
So me and the girls
use it all the time...

273
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:09,080
I just love the
"vaatavaran" of this club...

274
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:13,530
I just love the
"'vaatavaran"' of this bar...

275
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:15,200
I just love the word.

276
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:19,280
Alizeh, you should come
out with my girlfriends some time...

277
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:21,660
We could do like a girly lunch!

278
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:25,780
l have food allergies...
and people allergies, too.

279
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:30,450
- You all could go watch a movie, Alizeh!
- Yeah! You love movies!

280
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:32,990
Yeah, we should see a movie!

281
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:38,620
Actually, I just watched
a great French film... Priceless!

282
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:41,530
- I've seen it!
- Oh yeah?

283
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,490
- I really love it!
- What's it about?

284
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,910
This immoral hussy...

285
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:48,120
Prostitute.

286
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:51,410
...lures rich men for their money...

287
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:54,910
You know what, Lisa...
You should watch it.

288
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,120
I think you'll like it.

289
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:58,870
Why? What do you mean?

290
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:01,910
Just... It's a good film.

291
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,780
How dare you?

292
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,740
Honey, how dare she?

293
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,410
How dare you?

294
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,910
They're asking 'how dare you?'

295
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:14,200
Are you saying what
I think you're saying?

296
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:18,450
I had no idea you could think...

297
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:34,330
Wow, you're even
stupider than you look...

298
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,330
Who throws red wine on black?

299
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,200
Oh my God,
I can't believe she did this to me!

300
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:42,280
She's a very weird, weird girl!

301
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:44,330
Stop touching me right now!

302
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,120
Come on; let's get a cab...

303
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:50,030
Baby... don't cry...

304
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:54,870
Okay... Who wants
some low fat yogurt!

305
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,490
Go away!

306
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,280
She humiliated me...

307
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:13,580
Insulted me.

308
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:15,240
But you, Ayan...

309
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,740
...you never stand up for me!

310
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:20,580
I... always stand up for you.

311
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:24,240
I have a heart...

312
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:26,370
Yeah...

313
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:30,780
I have a heart, Goddamnit!

314
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:33,240
Come... Come here!

315
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:36,830
- Open doors and open drawers!

316
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:37,740
Hi!

317
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:39,240
Hello!

318
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:42,870
Here... why?

319
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,410
I was just doing yoga...

320
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:51,530
If I may say...
your form is remarkable.

321
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:57,080
Where is
Mademoiselle Skimpy, anyway?

322
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:59,780
Lisa was really upset yesterday!

323
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,080
Why?! She couldn't
find your chequebook?!

324
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:02,950
Hey!

325
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:04,410
Have some respect!

326
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:05,870
For your boxers?

327
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,030
What is this?

328
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:11,120
It's for you!

329
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,200
To hell with Lisa!

330
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:17,990
You're cute...

331
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,700
I came to apologise.

332
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:20,830
With this?

333
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:22,780
What, you want flowers?

334
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:23,660
Yes!

335
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:26,030
I hate flowers.

336
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,580
What did flowers ever do to you?

337
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:29,830
Flowers are so overrated!

338
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,450
Yeah, they look pretty...
smell nice...

339
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:34,160
...but colours fade
and scent disappears...

340
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,200
...and what you're left with
is lifeless, wilted and diseased.

341
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:40,910
Thorns, on the other hand...

342
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:43,080
They're not so fragile...

343
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,660
Thorns are fearless...

344
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,910
I don't want to be just a flower...

345
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,620
I want to be a thorn.

346
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:51,950
I want to smack you!

347
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:57,030
Though she be little,
but she is fierce!

348
00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:03,280
Please sir, share your gruel...

349
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:04,870
God, take it already...

350
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:07,240
May a thousand
Gods shine upon you...

351
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,910
You have to admit...
songs of the 80's were amazing...

352
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,490
Cheap, vulgar and extra tacky!

353
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,490
My playlist is 'Cheap Thrills'!

354
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:19,160
No way... mine is
'Jolly Good Bollywood"!

355
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:22,080
Most famous song of the 80's?

356
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,870
- Film?
- Himmatwala!

357
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:29,700
Cheapest song?

358
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:30,990
Film?

359
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,780
Maqsad, 1984!

360
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,950
You're not my long
lost brother, are you?

361
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,780
No but maybe the Doctor is!

362
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,410
Hopefully he’ll
just be long lost!

363
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:55,330
So... what are you
doing at 4 PM today?

364
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,120
I'm very busy...
Meetings, appointments...

365
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,240
Shut up! You're free!

366
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:01,660
Okay... I am!

367
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:49,410
- What's the problem?
- Problem?

368
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:51,620
I saw you busting
your moves at home...

369
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:54,780
...what's with the
dainty flailing now?

370
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,450
It's embarrassing.

371
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:58,030
Embarrassing?

372
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:01,410
Embarrassment is just a fancy
word for self-importance.

373
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:02,910
You're nobody here!

374
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:07,080
So you’re not shaming
Daddy Dearest...

375
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,200
Nor are you embarrassing yourself!

376
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:10,660
Just dance, man!

377
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:13,660
I can't dance in groups... only sing.

378
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:17,700
Oh, really?
And that's amazing...

379
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:20,280
...but this isn't choir
practice - it's a dance class!

380
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,030
It's just not my scene...

381
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,830
Shh! Just dance!

382
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,580
Forget your inner Lois Lane...

383
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:30,580
...you were born to be Wonder Woman!

384
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:33,450
In the name of JLo's sex appeal...

385
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:39,280
...show this cruel world,
you truly are a Baby Doll!

386
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:41,580
Baby Doll!

387
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,450
You're off your rocker...

388
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,410
Get ready...

389
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,240
See that girl...

390
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:58,490
Watch that scene...

391
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:00,620
Digging the Dancing Queen!

392
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:43,080
Woohoo! That was awesome!

393
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,410
You were right, I feel great!

394
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:46,660
Told ya!

395
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:51,450
But if you thought
this was impressive...

396
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:53,490
...wait 'til you hear me sing...

397
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,580
You'll be a fan!

398
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,200
God...

399
00:25:57,490 --> 00:25:58,490
Sing!

400
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:00,580
- What?
- Sing!

401
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,620
- What do you mean 'sing'?
- Sing means sing... Sing!

402
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:05,620
- Here?
- Where else?

403
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:06,950
On this sidewalk?

404
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,780
Not again!

405
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,330
Why are you getting annoyed?

406
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:12,030
Because, Celine Dion...

407
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:17,580
Your self-praise is
driving me up the wall!

408
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:21,030
You’re not taking me seriously...
My voice is a gift from God!

409
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:22,830
Then sing for Him!

410
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:23,990
No!

411
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,410
Don't be so attention seeking, man!

412
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:28,620
What if you fall in love with me?

413
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:32,870
Well, Mr. Casablanca...

414
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,370
I'll take my chances!

415
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,160
Come on... Sing.

416
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:39,660
Not singing?

417
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,530
This is your last chance...

418
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:45,370
Okay... then get lost!

419
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:57,070
My heart keeps on singing

420
00:26:58,370 --> 00:27:05,370
That you're my destination

421
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:08,070
May these nights never end

422
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:11,070
May these days never end

423
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:20,370
My heart keeps on singing...

424
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:27,870
How was that?

425
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:31,240
Abhorrent!

426
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:32,740
Ab-what?

427
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,780
That sounded like
an ad for constipation!

428
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:36,870
Yuck!

429
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,950
Following a tune isn't singing...

430
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:43,330
It had no pain... no emotion...

431
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:46,990
- And you’re an expert, so...
- I'm the audience!

432
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:48,740
There was no feeling.

433
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:54,580
Because this...
has never been broken.

434
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,700
You'll only really sing
when it does break.

435
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:00,740
Till then, you can do your MBA,
make some money...

436
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:02,160
...and leave music alone.

437
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,620
See you later... Bye!

438
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:46,280
Charlie Brown...
are you feeling blue?

439
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:47,620
Hmmm...

440
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:48,990
Hmm!

441
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:51,830
- I knew you'd call to apologise.
- You wish!

442
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:55,410
No sorry, no thank you
in the friendship code.

443
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:58,700
Whatever.

444
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:02,080
Listen! I've made another
great plan for a double date!

445
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:03,870
No, I've had enough!

446
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,330
Just hear me out!

447
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:08,330
The plan involves not
listening to Lisa's crap...

448
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:10,280
- ...and watching you dance!

449
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,910
Because you're my dancing star!

450
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:13,780
What?

451
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,490
Silent Disco, bro!

452
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:17,530
I'm not your bro.

453
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:19,370
Because you're my dancing star!

454
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:20,950
- Bye.

455
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:33,580
Here!

456
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:35,740
Excuse us!

457
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:38,370
- Doctor!
- Hi.

458
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:41,950
Alizeh and I wanted to
apologise for the other day...

459
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,330
What?! No!

460
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:44,490
Shush!

461
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:46,580
Thank you, Doctor.

462
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:48,830
That's so sweet...

463
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:49,910
Eid Mubarak.

464
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:50,990
Eid Mubarak?

465
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,530
- Today’s not Eid...
- Let it go, let it go!

466
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:57,530
So! If you like the
"vaatavaran" of this place...

467
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:01,080
Wear your headphones...

468
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:04,450
Switch to a channel you like...
And dance!

469
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:06,580
And here's an added bonus...

470
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:08,200
What's this?

471
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:10,120
This is the nectar of love...

472
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:12,620
Like dreaming while you're awake...

473
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:22,700
I'll be right back.

474
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,120
Alizeh!

475
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,280
You’ve just disappeared!
Where have you been?

476
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:35,080
- In London!
- Shut up!

477
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:37,910
You broke up with
Ali and forgot us all!!

478
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,990
- Are you okay?
- Yeah! Okay, listen...

479
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:42,950
Play a desi song, man!

480
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,700
This EDM is making my head spin...

481
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:47,080
What? Here?!

482
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,370
Just one!

483
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:51,990
Well... I have one...

484
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:54,580
But it's a break up song...

485
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:57,240
Then for sure!

486
00:30:57,950 --> 00:30:59,830
- Okay, tune into 4!
- Okay.

487
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,500
Breakup Song

488
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,100
Strengthens the feelings of the heart

489
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:08,000
Four & a half minutes long

490
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:10,510
Breakup Song Breakup Song

491
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,000
For an English bird, he broke my desi heart

492
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,410
I left, yep, left him

493
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:40,710
His dark deeds have exposed him...

494
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:44,310
I left, yep, left him!

495
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:45,800
I kept a stone on my heart

496
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:47,910
I applied makeup on my face,

497
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:56,210
and broke up with my dear beloved today.

498
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:04,610
I got up early in the morning...and did all of this

499
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,720
When did you do this?

500
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:21,720
Why did you break up with your beloved?

501
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:49,520
For a few days I cried like anything...

502
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,720
and then I deleted his number.

503
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,620
When the tears dried, I went to the parlour

504
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:03,600
In the parlour, I shampooed my hair thoroughly

505
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:07,720
I caught up with my college girlfriends,

506
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:16,130
and the ones I couldn't meet, I WhatsApped them!

507
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:33,700
Look baby, I feel whatever you did is very right

508
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,530
Now you forget the past,

509
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:37,730
the coming future is very bright!

510
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:39,630
I'm with you baby

511
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:42,430
There will be a party all night

512
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:44,530
Don't mind if I say too much

513
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:46,730
It's cuz I'm very drunk

514
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:49,530
Call him & abuse him verbally!

515
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:53,030
Burn his photo to ashes!

516
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,240
To hell with him!

517
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:31,490
God, I have to pee!

518
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,080
Excuse me, there's a queue.

519
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:35,160
I know, but I really
have to go... Please?

520
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:37,780
Where'd Lisa disappear?

521
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,830
Screw this, I'm going to the men's.

522
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:46,330
Excuse me, this is the men's loo.

523
00:34:46,490 --> 00:34:49,450
I know... but sometimes even
I feel like I could be a man...

524
00:34:57,830 --> 00:35:00,830
Doctor... Can you check my pulse?

525
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:06,330
- Don't cry, don't cry...

526
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:11,910
My boyfriend’s a douchebag, too!
Don't cry!

527
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:18,410
I'll get us a cab, okay?

528
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:27,160
Tell him your address!

529
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,240
I don't want to be alone tonight...

530
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:35,700
Take me with you...

531
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:57,490
You've gone insane!

532
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,330
Ayan, get up!

533
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:01,450
No? Fine, go to hell!

534
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:04,990
- Bye, Ayan!

535
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:15,330
Sit there!

536
00:36:15,450 --> 00:36:16,330
There?

537
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,450
Alizeh...

538
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:27,080
What was in that drink?!

539
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,280
Nectar of love...

540
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:31,160
My foot!

541
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:34,330
Lost my love...

542
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,160
My heart is shattered!

543
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:46,490
Now little pieces of my heart
are buzzing around me like flies...

544
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,530
Done?

545
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:11,240
Stop behaving like a spoilt child!

546
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:14,030
Someone just snatched
your favourite toy!

547
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,910
Your heart is just fine!

548
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:18,780
What do you even
know about heartbreak!

549
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,870
Sorry, only you know everything!

550
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:21,910
Listen!

551
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:24,950
A thousand people have
their heart broken every day...

552
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:28,700
And I've been down that road!

553
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:32,490
You've never even been
in the neighbourhood!

554
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,870
You're not even in love!

555
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:38,620
You know what...

556
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:40,120
Come.

557
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,120
Lie down here.

558
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:45,910
- Alizeh, I'm not in the mood for sex...
- I'll slap you again!

559
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:49,990
Lie down!

560
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:54,950
Now...

561
00:37:57,330 --> 00:37:58,830
Does it hurt?

562
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,870
That's heartbreak.

563
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:02,740
Now?

564
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:03,660
I'm okay.

565
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:04,870
This is Lisa!

566
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:08,780
Heartbreak!
Lisa!

567
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:11,240
I understood, I've got it!

568
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:12,660
Good!

569
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:17,030
Now please go home!
The high must have worn off.

570
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:21,530
This is Heartbreak Hotel, my friend...
You have to be qualified!

571
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:25,660
You've driven me mad all night...
Go away!

572
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:31,240
There she is... Ms. Gone Girl, herself.

573
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:35,990
I'm sorry, Ayan...

574
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:38,740
I truly am.

575
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:42,830
Will you call me?

576
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:46,990
No.

577
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:51,330
Jesus be with you.

578
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:53,870
Both of you.

579
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:03,700
Lisa!

580
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:06,120
Ye evil shrew!

581
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:07,450
Ye wayward wench!

582
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:11,780
May thee be attack'd by
the fireth of a thousand suns!

583
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:17,870
Burneth, thee shrew! This is the
beshrew of a wrong'd mistress!

584
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,120
Beshrew!

585
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:20,530
Beshrew?

586
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:22,200
What's that?

587
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:23,660
Curse!

588
00:40:26,330 --> 00:40:27,410
Please don't curse me.

589
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:29,370
Be gone, evil wench!

590
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:32,830
If thee ev'r showeth thy face again,
thee shall be ruin'd!

591
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,200
I'll help her with the bags.

592
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:41,450
Are you crazy?!

593
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,870
Out of here, black-hearted wench!

594
00:40:45,330 --> 00:40:47,870
I've been dreaming of
talking like that for years!

595
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:49,280
I'm having the best time!

596
00:40:52,370 --> 00:40:53,240
Now what?

597
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:54,700
Now?

598
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:57,830
Now! Recovery Retreat!

599
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:00,030
Recovery Retreat?

600
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:03,740
Recovery Retreat!
Heartbreak Holiday, dude...

601
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:07,030
I told Dad that I've been
hurt because of him...

602
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,780
...now I need to go and recover!

603
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,240
The plan is... Paris!

604
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:12,490
What are you doing this weekend?

605
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:15,990
I'm very busy... Classes,
appointments...

606
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,530
Shuddap! You're free!

607
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,990
Tell your father...
I've kidnapped you.

608
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,160
Excited!

609
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:40,200
Why are you so clingy?

610
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:04,490
What's the rating of this place?

611
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:06,490
5 stars! 3 for the hotel
and 2 for us!

612
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,580
1 you + 1 me equals 1 room?

613
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:14,580
2 hotel rooms = over budget!

614
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:17,240
What if you take advantage of me?!

615
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:18,910
Shut up!

616
00:42:22,830 --> 00:42:24,530
Wow, nice!

617
00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:27,330
Yeah, man! I love hotel rooms!

618
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:33,450
I wish I could live
in a hotel forever!

619
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:34,870
Exactly!!

620
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:38,580
New beds, new pillows!

621
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:41,620
New soap, new shampoo! For free!

622
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:45,120
Minibar!

623
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:47,530
That's not free!
You have to pay for it!

624
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:49,200
And you know what the best part is?

625
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:51,030
Room Service!!!

626
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:53,160
I'll find a menu.

627
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,580
Alizeh, have you ever
had paratha and eggs?

628
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:56,950
Like you'll get that here!

629
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:58,240
No no...

630
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:02,410
That feeling I get when I eat that...

631
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:06,870
I'm getting that feeling today...

632
00:43:07,870 --> 00:43:10,700
Like my heart is full.

633
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:12,160
You know?

634
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:15,740
I never want to lose this feeling.

635
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:20,200
I know that feeling...

636
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:23,910
I feel like I'm
starring in my own film...

637
00:43:25,290 --> 00:43:29,990
I want to dance, I want to sing,
I want to go crazy on the streets!

638
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:32,990
Feeling hot, hot, hot...

639
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:36,530
You think I'm nuts...

640
00:43:36,790 --> 00:43:39,410
No, dude... I've got
Bollywood in my blood, too.

641
00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:43,700
I want to wear saris
and run around mountains, too!

642
00:43:43,950 --> 00:43:46,080
The hills are alive...

643
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:48,030
But you know what...

644
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,950
I still have one
unrequited Bollywood dream...

645
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:52,280
Which one?

646
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:53,830
The airport dream.

647
00:43:55,990 --> 00:43:59,280
The airport dream. For so long
I dreamed that I would be that girl...

648
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:02,620
...the one the boy chased through
the airport and confessed his love.

649
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:04,490
Twice I thought he'd come...

650
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,450
Both times I waited for him...

651
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,780
And both times, he didn't come.

652
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:13,740
Mademoiselle, we are Private Jet
people. We don't have airport dreams.

653
00:44:16,370 --> 00:44:18,580
We’re young,
we're free and you're in Paris...

654
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:21,200
...with the future Mohd. Rafi!

655
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:23,740
What's your point, dude?

656
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:38,440
In this party, you're not the only gorgeous one

657
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:42,440
Then why are you sulking all alone?

658
00:44:43,210 --> 00:44:47,750
On whom my heart, has become obsessed

659
00:44:48,350 --> 00:44:51,250
Is some Frenchie!!!

660
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:55,750
If she agrees, then I'll take her in my arms

661
00:45:02,250 --> 00:45:05,250
When will you get such a chance again?

662
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:10,250
Where will you find a heart like mine?

663
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:15,250
Let me show you a colourful evening in Paris

664
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:18,450
Look look look look look!!!!

665
00:45:56,870 --> 00:45:58,370
- Now?!
- Now what?

666
00:45:58,580 --> 00:45:59,700
Plan?

667
00:46:00,370 --> 00:46:01,530
Plan?!

668
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:03,700
Wait for it...

669
00:46:24,870 --> 00:46:25,950
Oi, Hero!

670
00:46:26,990 --> 00:46:28,030
Come up!

671
00:46:28,330 --> 00:46:29,080
Help!

672
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:31,490
Do you know how to tie a sari?

673
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,240
I know how to take it off...

674
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,080
Disgusting...

675
00:46:38,330 --> 00:46:41,280
"Now, let's learn how
to tie a simple sari...

676
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:45,870
'Ensure your petticoat
and blouse are matching...

677
00:46:46,450 --> 00:46:49,410
Now, this is how to
start draping a sari...

678
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:51,030
Okay?

679
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:51,870
Okay...

680
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:57,450
Alizeh, if I go around you again...
we'll have to get married!

681
00:46:58,200 --> 00:46:59,280
Just shut up.

682
00:47:15,790 --> 00:47:17,330
I'll slap you!

683
00:47:18,790 --> 00:47:24,700
Start pleating like so...
and tuck it in.

684
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:33,410
Sexy...

685
00:47:34,950 --> 00:47:36,580
Not sexier than you...

686
00:47:41,370 --> 00:47:42,620
Shot's ready!

687
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:44,740
And so am I!

688
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:55,240
My morning prayer!

689
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:23,240
There are sweet sweet words of love
on our lips...

690
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:31,240
As I walk ahead,
right behind is my love

691
00:48:50,250 --> 00:48:57,250
I wish my whole life
can be spent like this

692
00:48:58,250 --> 00:49:02,250
As I walk ahead,
right behind me is my love...

693
00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:08,330
Do you even see what I'm wearing?!

694
00:49:08,950 --> 00:49:10,200
Idiot!

695
00:49:12,370 --> 00:49:14,240
Get up now! Come on!

696
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:18,660
Where's my jacket?

697
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:21,830
You know, you're useless!

698
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:26,410
Dude... Bollywood people are nuts!

699
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:29,030
It's too freaking cold for romance!

700
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:31,240
Come on in!

701
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:41,830
You should be called Hennessey,
not Alizeh.

702
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:43,990
Cognac's not really liquor.

703
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:45,910
Of course it is! Give it here!

704
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:00,450
You really like me...

705
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:05,410
You really like me.

706
00:50:06,410 --> 00:50:10,700
Like really, really, really like me.

707
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:13,330
Don't lie... because I've noticed.

708
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:14,830
Yeah...

709
00:50:15,450 --> 00:50:16,700
I really like you!

710
00:50:16,870 --> 00:50:18,660
Why? Quick, tell me.

711
00:50:19,790 --> 00:50:21,280
I don't know, man...

712
00:50:22,330 --> 00:50:23,740
The first time we met...

713
00:50:23,830 --> 00:50:25,660
...when we spent the night talking...

714
00:50:25,870 --> 00:50:32,410
I just got the feeling
that you're my friend...

715
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:35,240
My best friend...

716
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:37,580
...and always will be.

717
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:39,120
I don't know...

718
00:50:45,490 --> 00:50:48,370
You know, I wasn't popular in school...

719
00:50:49,790 --> 00:50:52,870
They thought I was a weirdo,
freak, introverted...

720
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:56,700
And honestly, it made no difference...

721
00:50:57,660 --> 00:50:58,740
You know why?

722
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:05,080
Because I knew I was
holding on to my personality...

723
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:08,410
I was waiting to find that one person...

724
00:51:08,790 --> 00:51:10,740
...who got my weirdness.

725
00:51:19,870 --> 00:51:22,280
So... best friend, huh?

726
00:51:23,870 --> 00:51:26,370
Bestest friend!

727
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:32,990
And... you're not attracted to me?

728
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:37,030
No...

729
00:51:44,370 --> 00:51:45,870
What's wrong?

730
00:51:48,950 --> 00:51:50,660
Ego's a bit bruised...

731
00:51:57,740 --> 00:52:01,700
Are you attracted?

732
00:52:02,830 --> 00:52:03,530
Like...

733
00:52:04,620 --> 00:52:05,450
...a lot?

734
00:52:06,870 --> 00:52:10,490
Not a lot... But... yeah I am.

735
00:52:18,790 --> 00:52:21,410
Don’t feel weird...
I don't love you or anything.

736
00:52:21,910 --> 00:52:23,700
No, no... I know that.

737
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:31,910
You know,
I'm really happy we're friends...

738
00:52:33,410 --> 00:52:39,620
I feel that sometimes
lust just kills friendship...

739
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:43,080
Love is passion...

740
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:46,370
...but friendship is peace.

741
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:52,910
And I never, ever want
to lose the peace between us.

742
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:55,910
Girlfriend, boyfriend, husband, wife...

743
00:52:56,370 --> 00:52:59,830
... when those relationships die...
the people just leave.

744
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:07,870
And I never want to leave you, Ayan...

745
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:12,080
- Never?
- Never.

746
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:18,990
Wow, I feel all mushy...

747
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,240
What do I do?

748
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:25,490
Go ahead...

749
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:28,240
I'm feeling a little mushy, myself...

750
00:53:29,490 --> 00:53:30,830
Give me a hug...

751
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:00,450
I've decided that...

752
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:01,580
What?

753
00:54:01,830 --> 00:54:04,950
I've decided we're
staying here another week!

754
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:10,200
Oh, no... I'm really busy...
Meetings, appointments...

755
00:54:10,410 --> 00:54:12,280
Shuddap! You're free!

756
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:13,490
Okay, I am!

757
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:16,370
- So good?
- Yes, poopie! Yes!

758
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:22,700
Can we get two beers and
something to eat... like peanuts...

759
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:25,240
Peanuts... you know, peanuts?

760
00:54:25,870 --> 00:54:28,030
Kidding... just beer, please!

761
00:54:28,290 --> 00:54:29,910
Stop staring and pay!

762
00:55:52,290 --> 00:55:55,120
Ayan, I need to go...

763
00:55:56,540 --> 00:55:58,200
I need to get out of here...

764
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:01,080
You can stay if you want,
I just need to go.

765
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:02,780
One sec, I'll organize the plane...

766
00:56:02,870 --> 00:56:05,700
I'll walk home if l have to,
I just need to go right now!

767
00:56:11,410 --> 00:56:13,240
Where's my stuff?

768
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:27,120
This room is such a mess...

769
00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:30,080
Alizeh are you okay?

770
00:56:30,790 --> 00:56:32,450
Alizeh... are you alright?

771
00:56:32,830 --> 00:56:33,620
Are you okay, Alizeh?

772
00:56:33,790 --> 00:56:36,580
I'm fine, Ayan! Just stop- I'm fine!

773
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:40,580
I'm fine!

774
00:56:46,660 --> 00:56:48,030
He can't come back...

775
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:51,450
I don't want to see him.

776
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:56,950
He was gone.
I erased every trace of him...

777
00:56:57,450 --> 00:57:02,280
He can't come back,
do you understand?

778
00:57:29,490 --> 00:57:32,740
Yeah, Captain...
Terminal FBO 4, right?

779
00:57:34,490 --> 00:57:36,870
Okay... 45 minutes.

780
00:57:37,290 --> 00:57:38,490
Thank you so much!

781
00:57:38,790 --> 00:57:40,660
Alizeh... Alizeh!

782
00:57:40,870 --> 00:57:42,870
Sir, please!
She doesn't want to talk to you!

783
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:44,450
Who the hell is this?
Your lover?

784
00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:46,080
- I'm her friend.
- I wasn't speaking to you!

785
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:47,450
Well, she doesn't
want to speak to you!

786
00:57:47,540 --> 00:57:50,240
Stay out of it, man!
This is between us!

787
00:57:51,540 --> 00:57:52,330
Sir, please!

788
00:57:52,490 --> 00:57:53,780
- Hands off!
- Or else?

789
00:57:53,910 --> 00:57:55,660
Stop it! Stop it!

790
00:57:58,790 --> 00:57:59,780
Stop it!

791
00:58:05,370 --> 00:58:06,950
I love you, Alizeh...

792
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:11,160
Come on, Alizeh.

793
00:58:11,660 --> 00:58:14,530
I know I made mistakes, but
how much longer will you punish me...

794
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:21,080
You can't just cut me out
of your life after all these years...

795
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:34,870
Come on, let's go...

796
00:58:35,620 --> 00:58:38,660
Alizeh, please give me a chance...

797
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:40,330
Ayan...

798
00:58:42,950 --> 00:58:43,870
Go.

799
00:58:46,870 --> 00:58:47,830
Go...

800
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:52,660
Okay, I'm right here... I'll wait...

801
00:58:52,950 --> 00:58:54,080
No, Ayan...

802
00:58:54,790 --> 00:58:55,910
Go...

803
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:58,030
To London?

804
00:59:03,660 --> 00:59:05,580
Alizeh, the plane
won't come back for you...

805
00:59:07,870 --> 00:59:09,330
I'll find my way...

806
00:59:11,540 --> 00:59:12,330
Okay...

807
00:59:16,740 --> 00:59:17,780
Take care.

808
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:47,080
Ever been suddenly slapped?

809
00:59:49,410 --> 00:59:50,990
That's love.

810
00:59:52,490 --> 00:59:55,740
And it only hits you harder,
when there's someone else involved...

811
00:59:58,410 --> 01:00:00,580
Why is there ever someone else?

812
01:00:12,580 --> 01:00:14,080
- Hello?
- Ayan?

813
01:00:14,490 --> 01:00:16,200
Alizeh! Hi!

814
01:00:16,660 --> 01:00:19,120
Where are you?

815
01:00:19,580 --> 01:00:22,530
Where are you?!
I've been calling you for days!

816
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:26,120
Please leave a message
after the tone...

817
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:28,280
Please leave a message...
Even your voicemail's full!

818
01:00:28,450 --> 01:00:29,990
Where are you?!

819
01:00:30,700 --> 01:00:31,660
In Lucknow...

820
01:00:32,290 --> 01:00:34,660
Lucknow...why?

821
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:36,700
I'm here with Ali...

822
01:00:39,290 --> 01:00:40,780
Ali... Right...

823
01:00:41,830 --> 01:00:43,080
Same flight...

824
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:45,280
Passenger seat...

825
01:00:45,870 --> 01:00:47,490
Together... Same plane?

826
01:00:47,580 --> 01:00:51,370
- What are you saying?!
I'm with Ali...

827
01:00:52,490 --> 01:00:53,450
Did you sleep with him?

828
01:00:53,660 --> 01:00:54,830
- Ayan! What?!

829
01:00:55,700 --> 01:00:56,780
Don't lie to me...

830
01:00:57,120 --> 01:00:58,080
I know you had sex with him.

831
01:00:58,790 --> 01:01:00,280
He's your lover now...

832
01:01:00,700 --> 01:01:01,580
Boyfriend...

833
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:02,780
Back together...

834
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:04,620
Are you drunk?!

835
01:01:04,740 --> 01:01:06,080
You're the one who's drunk!

836
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:10,450
You said you never
wanted to see him again!

837
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:12,700
I know, Ayan...

838
01:01:13,870 --> 01:01:15,910
But people in love are liars.

839
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:18,330
This isn't love... it's weakness!

840
01:01:18,830 --> 01:01:20,700
Ali's my weakness...

841
01:01:22,990 --> 01:01:27,620
Alizeh, he's going to leave you.

842
01:01:28,330 --> 01:01:30,370
Then don't call me...
I'm very busy!

843
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:32,660
I know you're being protective...

844
01:01:32,870 --> 01:01:34,410
You're a goddamn fraud!

845
01:01:34,620 --> 01:01:36,030
Fake! Liar!

846
01:01:36,790 --> 01:01:39,450
You can say what you want...

847
01:01:40,620 --> 01:01:42,740
But I love him...

848
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:46,120
- I can't help it...
I really love him.

849
01:01:46,660 --> 01:01:48,660
- He's very sorry...

850
01:01:48,910 --> 01:01:49,740
- He even cried!

851
01:01:49,830 --> 01:01:51,530
But Alizeh, I cry all the time...

852
01:01:52,870 --> 01:01:54,870
Where do you fit
in to all of this?!

853
01:01:55,290 --> 01:01:56,030
Yeah...

854
01:01:56,620 --> 01:01:58,160
What does it have to do with me?

855
01:01:58,660 --> 01:02:01,080
Ayan, listen... It's important.

856
01:02:01,660 --> 01:02:05,280
Ali's going on tour for a year...
and he wants me to go with him.

857
01:02:05,910 --> 01:02:08,200
- He wants to marry me and...

858
01:02:08,450 --> 01:02:10,200
- ...he proposed.

859
01:02:10,700 --> 01:02:12,080
What did you say...

860
01:02:12,580 --> 01:02:13,870
- Yes, what else?!

861
01:02:14,990 --> 01:02:18,410
- Mum and Dad have kicked me out...

862
01:02:18,620 --> 01:02:22,780
- ...they won't come for
the wedding, either...

863
01:02:23,580 --> 01:02:25,830
- Some of Ali's useless cousins
will be at the wedding...

864
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:29,950
- Will you come from my side...
For me?

865
01:02:32,290 --> 01:02:33,950
I don't have a visa...

866
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:37,080
- Yo, Mr. Britain!
I'll organize all of that...

867
01:02:37,700 --> 01:02:39,830
- So... You'll come?

868
01:02:41,490 --> 01:02:42,740
Hello? Ayan?

869
01:02:43,870 --> 01:02:44,830
Ayan?

870
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:47,620
Of course I will!

871
01:02:47,790 --> 01:02:49,620
Thank you, man...

872
01:02:50,620 --> 01:02:51,910
- Dude, I love you...

873
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:53,780
- Say congratulations!

874
01:03:28,900 --> 01:03:31,400
There is no other Punjabi girl

875
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:34,070
like you in the village, O dear one

876
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:37,300
Why do you feel shy, sitting near the window?

877
01:03:37,710 --> 01:03:40,810
Be visible on the patio, O dear one

878
01:03:59,410 --> 01:04:02,910
O bride-to-be, your style is very fantastic

879
01:04:03,410 --> 01:04:06,610
You give orders on social media

880
01:04:07,410 --> 01:04:09,810
You talk on the phone with your left hand...

881
01:04:11,010 --> 01:04:13,810
...and apply henna on your right hand!

882
01:04:33,210 --> 01:04:36,210
You don't worry about your boyfriend

883
01:04:36,710 --> 01:04:38,910
and say 'Okay, bye' on the first date itself!

884
01:04:39,610 --> 01:04:43,910
The poor guy feels sad like Devdas,

885
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:46,910
and then you smile and make an innocent face.

886
01:04:47,410 --> 01:04:54,110
Cutie pie, cutie pie...

887
01:04:55,420 --> 01:05:01,420
Oh my... cutie pie...

888
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:20,920
You're going to parties wearing perfume,

889
01:05:21,820 --> 01:05:25,220
is an old way of luring the guys...

890
01:05:25,420 --> 01:05:29,220
You touch all the chords of body and soul,

891
01:05:29,420 --> 01:05:33,220
play flute without even touching it to your mouth.

892
01:05:33,420 --> 01:05:36,820
It's okay to steal the sleep of the young guys,

893
01:05:37,230 --> 01:05:40,300
But why do you increase the blood pressure of the old ones?!

894
01:05:40,430 --> 01:05:42,430
You have no worries regarding your boyfriend!

895
01:05:43,430 --> 01:05:46,430
You end the first date itself by saying 'Ok, bye!'

896
01:05:47,430 --> 01:05:50,230
Like Devdas, he cries...

897
01:05:51,430 --> 01:05:54,430
While you laugh and make an innocent face

898
01:05:58,430 --> 01:06:04,430
Cutie Pie...Cutie Pie...

899
01:06:33,540 --> 01:06:34,990
Hi, bro!

900
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:47,780
Alizeh...

901
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:49,410
Weds...

902
01:06:51,450 --> 01:06:52,450
Ayan!

903
01:07:28,290 --> 01:07:31,660
Ayan!
You're spinning like a top!

904
01:07:37,850 --> 01:07:39,700
Okay, I'll leave now...

905
01:07:39,700 --> 01:07:42,700
...remember me in your prayers

906
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:45,550
Keep the taste of my intention...

907
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:48,710
...on your tongue

908
01:07:54,150 --> 01:07:56,000
Okay, I'll leave now...

909
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:59,000
...remember me in your prayers

910
01:07:59,100 --> 01:08:01,850
Keep the taste of my intention...

911
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,210
...on your tongue

912
01:08:04,700 --> 01:08:06,910
Keep my good deeds...

913
01:08:07,210 --> 01:08:09,210
...in the corners of your heart

914
01:08:09,700 --> 01:08:12,210
And keep my greetings close to you...

915
01:08:12,410 --> 01:08:15,210
even in my letters & telegrams

916
01:08:15,710 --> 01:08:20,210
I have taken your darkness,

917
01:08:20,300 --> 01:08:25,800
and my bright shining star is yours now.

918
01:08:26,010 --> 01:08:28,500
O my moon...

919
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:31,100
O my dearest moon...

920
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:33,900
O my beloved moon...

921
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,200
O my beloved!

922
01:09:29,660 --> 01:09:32,830
You're seriously like Mohd. Rafi!

923
01:09:33,990 --> 01:09:36,030
I was wrong about you, man!

924
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:38,030
You really can sing!

925
01:09:41,410 --> 01:09:45,330
Forget this MBA...
Follow your dreams!

926
01:09:45,660 --> 01:09:48,030
Not like you can't afford to!

927
01:09:48,290 --> 01:09:49,700
Today you sang with such...

928
01:09:49,790 --> 01:09:50,950
Pain?

929
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:03,410
Love?

930
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:05,950
Ayan...

931
01:10:06,580 --> 01:10:07,910
Tell me, Alizeh...

932
01:10:08,490 --> 01:10:11,660
Did I sing with pain & love today?

933
01:10:15,160 --> 01:10:16,490
Who was it for?

934
01:10:20,540 --> 01:10:21,910
Who was it for?

935
01:10:22,990 --> 01:10:24,330
Should I tell you?

936
01:10:25,290 --> 01:10:26,910
- No...
- But you must know.

937
01:10:28,450 --> 01:10:30,240
I love you, Alizeh.

938
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:33,410
I love you...

939
01:10:34,240 --> 01:10:36,280
I'm madly in love with you.

940
01:10:39,700 --> 01:10:43,200
And now, it's too late...

941
01:10:49,540 --> 01:10:54,660
Now, I want that DJ Ali
to die in the wedding procession...

942
01:10:55,620 --> 01:10:58,490
And from that shock,
I want you to die, too.

943
01:11:01,490 --> 01:11:04,240
If I can't have you, no one can.

944
01:11:06,910 --> 01:11:09,120
Ayan... Please...

945
01:11:09,370 --> 01:11:10,910
Please, Ayan!

946
01:11:13,540 --> 01:11:15,780
You want to know what it feels like?!

947
01:11:20,700 --> 01:11:21,910
I'll show you...

948
01:11:22,290 --> 01:11:23,620
Ayan!

949
01:11:25,240 --> 01:11:36,370
Alizeh...

950
01:11:36,490 --> 01:11:37,990
Alizeh!

951
01:11:44,490 --> 01:11:48,410
May death not come til you part, Mrs. DJ Ali...

952
01:11:49,410 --> 01:11:50,950
Have a great life...

953
01:11:52,450 --> 01:11:53,910
It's all good.

954
01:11:55,910 --> 01:12:01,610
Beloved...

955
01:12:03,610 --> 01:12:08,610
O beloved

956
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:11,200
O my moon...

957
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:13,510
O my moon...

958
01:12:14,210 --> 01:12:19,910
O my beloved moon...

959
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:43,500
I am turning my path away from your direction...

960
01:12:45,100 --> 01:12:55,420
I am a sandlewood leaving my fragrance with you...

961
01:12:56,150 --> 01:13:07,050
...leaving my heart's desires under your pillow

962
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:24,210
This nomad wraps the cotton cloth of an ascetic and goes...

963
01:13:34,210 --> 01:13:37,210
O my beloved...

964
01:14:23,910 --> 01:14:25,160
May I sit here?

965
01:14:25,370 --> 01:14:27,200
My wife's sitting there.

966
01:14:29,620 --> 01:14:31,030
I don't see anyone.

967
01:14:35,790 --> 01:14:37,030
Excuse me, ma'am...

968
01:14:38,450 --> 01:14:39,830
May I sit there?

969
01:14:43,160 --> 01:14:44,580
Yeah, sure...

970
01:14:45,660 --> 01:14:46,990
Thank you.

971
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:52,200
Hello!

972
01:14:52,950 --> 01:14:53,780
Hello.

973
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:56,450
Grapes?

974
01:15:03,240 --> 01:15:05,580
There are a lot of empty seats...

975
01:15:09,490 --> 01:15:11,080
But I don't want to be alone.

976
01:15:15,330 --> 01:15:16,620
I was at a wedding...

977
01:15:16,790 --> 01:15:18,240
My best friend's wedding!

978
01:15:20,160 --> 01:15:21,830
I left that halfway.

979
01:15:23,450 --> 01:15:24,870
Book or the wedding?

980
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:28,280
Both...

981
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:37,490
British Passport!

982
01:15:38,290 --> 01:15:40,990
I was born in England. You too?

983
01:15:42,740 --> 01:15:44,120
Same pinch...

984
01:15:44,620 --> 01:15:48,120
I'm on my way to
Frankfurt...Via Dubai.

985
01:15:49,620 --> 01:15:50,580
You?

986
01:15:50,830 --> 01:15:51,990
Vienna.

987
01:15:52,620 --> 01:15:53,740
Via Dubai?

988
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:57,780
Same pinch!

989
01:16:00,330 --> 01:16:03,450
So what's up?
What do you do?

990
01:16:05,490 --> 01:16:06,740
Write.

991
01:16:07,450 --> 01:16:10,160
Nice to meet you, Ms. Wright.
I'm Ayan.

992
01:16:11,080 --> 01:16:12,490
I write poetry.

993
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:16,580
Oh!

994
01:16:25,370 --> 01:16:26,830
Too good...

995
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:28,410
We'll chat on the flight...

996
01:16:28,620 --> 01:16:31,620
Wait 'til you hear
some of my stories...

997
01:16:31,950 --> 01:16:33,200
What's up?

998
01:16:34,950 --> 01:16:37,080
Chatter is a fool's pursuit.

999
01:16:37,870 --> 01:16:41,780
Your eyes can't hide
what your words conceal.

1000
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:51,990
Why hide your tears when, without permission, they don't fall?

1001
01:16:55,240 --> 01:16:56,910
Don't imprison them...

1002
01:16:57,290 --> 01:16:58,950
Let them be free...

1003
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:16,450
I'm very sad...

1004
01:17:52,580 --> 01:17:53,620
Thanks for listening...

1005
01:17:53,700 --> 01:17:56,620
And sorry... I think...
I fell asleep, talking.

1006
01:17:56,910 --> 01:17:58,490
Well, you were even
talking in your sleep...

1007
01:17:58,660 --> 01:18:00,160
Shit! What did I say?

1008
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:06,120
Ayan...

1009
01:18:06,580 --> 01:18:09,740
I know words can't always
heal scars that run so deep...

1010
01:18:10,410 --> 01:18:12,950
But words are all I have...

1011
01:18:13,240 --> 01:18:15,620
So here, this is for you!

1012
01:18:16,290 --> 01:18:18,240
I hope it helps a little...

1013
01:18:18,490 --> 01:18:21,120
And if words aren't your thing...

1014
01:18:21,580 --> 01:18:23,200
Maybe the number will help.

1015
01:19:28,490 --> 01:19:32,580
People always say
heart over mind...

1016
01:19:33,290 --> 01:19:35,240
But when the heart breaks...

1017
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:38,910
Shouldn't you follow your mind?

1018
01:19:49,910 --> 01:19:51,120
Hello?

1019
01:19:51,290 --> 01:19:54,280
- Chatter is a fool's
pursuit... or so I've heard...

1020
01:19:54,450 --> 01:19:56,660
- But old habits die hard...

1021
01:19:57,540 --> 01:20:00,370
I've been rather
impatient for this call...

1022
01:20:05,740 --> 01:20:06,740
Hello?

1023
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:09,030
Sorry, my cheeks are turning pink...

1024
01:20:09,370 --> 01:20:12,120
You make me blush...

1025
01:20:13,660 --> 01:20:15,580
It's true, though...

1026
01:20:15,830 --> 01:20:19,160
You've told me
everything about you...

1027
01:20:19,370 --> 01:20:21,740
...and you know nothing about me...

1028
01:20:23,540 --> 01:20:25,660
- Why do you think I'm here?
- Where?

1029
01:20:26,620 --> 01:20:27,660
Vienna...

1030
01:20:28,040 --> 01:20:30,330
What are you doing here?

1031
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:33,200
Crossed the boundary
to cross some boundaries...

1032
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:36,530
That's tough...

1033
01:20:36,740 --> 01:20:39,370
- I can handle tough...

1034
01:20:39,620 --> 01:20:43,200
Get to work, then...
See you tonight at 8?

1035
01:20:43,290 --> 01:20:44,330
- I'll send you the address...

1036
01:20:44,410 --> 01:20:46,030
Okay... Of your house, right?

1037
01:20:46,240 --> 01:20:47,450
You wish...

1038
01:23:33,870 --> 01:23:35,030
Good morning...

1039
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:36,120
Morning...

1040
01:23:36,200 --> 01:23:37,580
Slept well?

1041
01:23:37,790 --> 01:23:38,870
Hmm...

1042
01:23:39,540 --> 01:23:42,490
I made breakfast for myself,
I hope you don't mind...

1043
01:23:43,740 --> 01:23:45,620
I'd have made you some...

1044
01:23:45,990 --> 01:23:48,080
But I didn't know
what you'd like.

1045
01:23:48,290 --> 01:23:50,450
You know nothing about me.

1046
01:23:51,080 --> 01:23:52,660
I got to know quite
a bit last night...

1047
01:23:52,740 --> 01:23:55,620
Passion isn't familiarity...

1048
01:23:57,700 --> 01:23:59,870
I'm blushing again...

1049
01:24:01,540 --> 01:24:02,990
Change of topic!

1050
01:24:03,330 --> 01:24:05,200
I read some of your poetry...

1051
01:24:06,910 --> 01:24:08,240
It's beautiful.

1052
01:24:13,540 --> 01:24:16,490
Glad you liked them...

1053
01:24:16,910 --> 01:24:20,450
I don't get much
appreciation for my poetry...

1054
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:24,580
There's so much angst
in your poems...

1055
01:24:26,370 --> 01:24:29,080
Angst will always find angst...

1056
01:24:29,450 --> 01:24:31,700
Can I steal it for my music?

1057
01:24:33,660 --> 01:24:35,870
Careful...
I have an excellent lawyer...

1058
01:24:35,950 --> 01:24:38,200
He didn't even spare
my ex-husband!

1059
01:24:38,540 --> 01:24:40,080
Divorced!

1060
01:24:40,330 --> 01:24:41,780
Why so pleased?

1061
01:24:42,040 --> 01:24:43,620
Of course!
You're single...

1062
01:24:44,370 --> 01:24:45,530
Happily divorced...

1063
01:24:46,120 --> 01:24:47,450
...and I have no regrets...

1064
01:24:47,700 --> 01:24:50,160
Tahir and I are
very good friends.

1065
01:24:50,870 --> 01:24:53,160
Every poetess should
marry at least once...

1066
01:24:53,450 --> 01:24:56,740
A happy marriage means
a good life...

1067
01:24:57,540 --> 01:25:00,870
...an unhappy one means
good poetry!

1068
01:25:02,290 --> 01:25:03,780
By the way, I was kidding...

1069
01:25:03,910 --> 01:25:06,870
If you need my poetry...
Go ahead.

1070
01:25:07,740 --> 01:25:09,120
Thanks...

1071
01:25:09,660 --> 01:25:11,660
...but what I need is you.

1072
01:25:13,160 --> 01:25:15,330
I don't want to be needed...

1073
01:25:16,040 --> 01:25:17,660
I want to be desired.

1074
01:25:24,330 --> 01:25:26,370
You're relentless...

1075
01:25:26,620 --> 01:25:27,870
Like a walking-talking Ghalib...

1076
01:25:27,950 --> 01:25:29,410
...what am I supposed to say?

1077
01:25:30,740 --> 01:25:32,990
Your silence said
more than enough...

1078
01:25:33,990 --> 01:25:34,990
Don't worry...

1079
01:25:35,620 --> 01:25:37,910
l have no room for
a relationship in my life...

1080
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:40,490
Not anymore...

1081
01:25:42,370 --> 01:25:44,580
There’s more than
one kind of relationship...

1082
01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:48,660
...but only if you're up for it.

1083
01:25:51,790 --> 01:25:53,660
What are the rules like?

1084
01:25:54,040 --> 01:25:55,780
Easily broken...

1085
01:25:58,370 --> 01:26:00,410
So you get my poetry...

1086
01:26:00,910 --> 01:26:02,950
The chance to drown your sorrows...

1087
01:26:05,240 --> 01:26:06,280
What do I get?

1088
01:26:08,370 --> 01:26:09,990
I thought I was enough.

1089
01:26:38,900 --> 01:26:43,300
The bird of my soul writhes in pain

1090
01:26:44,300 --> 01:26:48,300
But it's unable to find the island of peace

1091
01:26:49,300 --> 01:26:54,300
What should I do? What should I do?!!

1092
01:26:55,310 --> 01:26:59,310
Just for once, show yourself God

1093
01:27:00,310 --> 01:27:05,310
Give me some hope even if it's false

1094
01:27:06,310 --> 01:27:10,310
What should I do? What should I do?!

1095
01:27:10,610 --> 01:27:14,110
Bulleya, friend of Ranjha

1096
01:27:14,310 --> 01:27:16,310
Listen to my call, Bulleya

1097
01:27:17,310 --> 01:27:19,310
You are my only friend, Bulleya

1098
01:27:20,310 --> 01:27:22,310
You are my guide, my guardian

1099
01:27:22,310 --> 01:27:24,310
Your destination, O crazy one...

1100
01:27:25,310 --> 01:27:27,310
...is across the border

1101
01:27:28,310 --> 01:27:30,310
O our caretaker, Bulleya

1102
01:27:31,320 --> 01:27:33,320
You're my guardian, my guide

1103
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:11,310
I'm just an immigrant like
a butterfly hugging Kabul

1104
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:16,320
I stay for one moment & fly away in another

1105
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:23,320
I'm on the path that is searching for heaven

1106
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:28,320
Where you turn, I turn with you

1107
01:28:29,320 --> 01:28:33,320
I want to be part of your caravan

1108
01:28:34,320 --> 01:28:39,320
I want to chisel at my shortcomings
& become worthy of you

1109
01:28:40,320 --> 01:28:44,320
What should I do? What should I do?!

1110
01:29:08,790 --> 01:29:12,490
"I seek the truth that
pierces the darkest night..."

1111
01:29:12,950 --> 01:29:17,080
"I seek the devotion
I surrendered in your stead..."

1112
01:29:17,410 --> 01:29:20,120
"I have known the virtue
that surrender proffers..."'

1113
01:29:20,330 --> 01:29:23,490
"But I seek that heaven
for which I have bled.

1114
01:29:25,220 --> 01:29:30,220
From the day two strangers became
involved in love,

1115
01:29:31,220 --> 01:29:35,220
all the moments of loneliness have been delayed

1116
01:29:36,230 --> 01:29:43,230
Why do I want to fall in love once again?

1117
01:29:48,230 --> 01:29:53,230
My heart is looking for reasons to say no

1118
01:29:54,230 --> 01:29:59,230
But my body doesn't adhere to any bonds

1119
01:30:00,230 --> 01:30:02,230
Since I have met you

1120
01:30:03,230 --> 01:30:05,230
I want to rebel against my own self

1121
01:30:08,230 --> 01:30:13,230
I have fire left in me, come test it

1122
01:30:14,230 --> 01:30:18,230
I'm giving myself to you
so you do as you wish with me

1123
01:30:19,230 --> 01:30:24,230
O beloved...O beloved...

1124
01:31:30,830 --> 01:31:32,580
Is this supposed to be good?

1125
01:31:33,080 --> 01:31:34,700
I don't get it...

1126
01:31:36,910 --> 01:31:38,780
Didn't you say he was world famous?

1127
01:31:39,580 --> 01:31:40,700
He is...

1128
01:31:41,330 --> 01:31:44,530
People really admire his work...

1129
01:31:45,410 --> 01:31:46,830
And you?

1130
01:31:51,540 --> 01:31:52,780
You're awkward.

1131
01:31:54,580 --> 01:31:55,740
A little...

1132
01:32:00,200 --> 01:32:02,120
You can leave, if you like...

1133
01:32:02,790 --> 01:32:04,490
And leave you alone with him?

1134
01:32:05,660 --> 01:32:06,740
No way...

1135
01:32:06,910 --> 01:32:08,870
I'm dying to meet your ex-husband.

1136
01:32:13,910 --> 01:32:14,990
How come?

1137
01:32:16,330 --> 01:32:17,490
Just...

1138
01:32:21,790 --> 01:32:22,990
- Tahir...
- Hi...

1139
01:32:24,660 --> 01:32:28,240
Your Facebook tells me
too many things have changed...

1140
01:32:28,450 --> 01:32:30,030
Like the colour of your walls...

1141
01:32:30,540 --> 01:32:32,490
...and the claim to your heart...

1142
01:32:33,540 --> 01:32:34,410
Ayan.

1143
01:32:35,700 --> 01:32:36,620
Fantastic work, sir!

1144
01:32:36,740 --> 01:32:38,870
Sir? Really... Sir?!

1145
01:32:39,450 --> 01:32:42,030
Are you trying to
make me sound old?

1146
01:32:42,580 --> 01:32:45,410
By the way, he doesn"t
call you ma'am does he?

1147
01:32:45,580 --> 01:32:47,280
- You think?!
- I don't know!

1148
01:32:49,620 --> 01:32:53,160
So you're the one...
who's keeping her up at night...

1149
01:32:53,330 --> 01:32:55,700
Why waste time on sleep?

1150
01:32:56,330 --> 01:32:59,120
Sleep is critical...

1151
01:32:59,990 --> 01:33:02,030
...for her to dream about me?

1152
01:33:02,370 --> 01:33:03,700
Oh, now I definitely
won't let her sleep.

1153
01:33:03,790 --> 01:33:05,370
I can't see this...

1154
01:33:06,160 --> 01:33:07,780
Change of topic!

1155
01:33:09,540 --> 01:33:13,200
Besides, you've fulfilled
your dreams...

1156
01:33:13,410 --> 01:33:16,080
Your new work is very interesting.

1157
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:17,870
Actually, fantastic!

1158
01:33:19,120 --> 01:33:23,700
Without a lover in his arms,
what else is a man to do...

1159
01:33:24,540 --> 01:33:28,660
- Do you guys rehearse these lines?
- No, totally natural!

1160
01:33:28,830 --> 01:33:30,080
Ah, natural...

1161
01:33:32,790 --> 01:33:36,780
People often shroud
their fear with words...

1162
01:33:37,700 --> 01:33:40,410
Our relationship
may have changed...

1163
01:33:41,620 --> 01:33:43,120
...but the fear remains.

1164
01:33:44,040 --> 01:33:45,240
Why did it change...

1165
01:33:45,790 --> 01:33:46,830
If I may ask?

1166
01:33:46,910 --> 01:33:49,780
Maybe you should
be asking the person...

1167
01:33:50,080 --> 01:33:52,160
...whose nights are now yours...

1168
01:33:54,330 --> 01:33:56,280
People often falter...

1169
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:58,870
...on the slippery slopes
of relationships...

1170
01:33:59,540 --> 01:34:00,700
Yeah...

1171
01:34:03,200 --> 01:34:05,490
You could have shown
me a better way...

1172
01:34:06,290 --> 01:34:09,410
Let the one who is lost,
find his own way...

1173
01:34:15,700 --> 01:34:17,450
I hate you.

1174
01:34:17,540 --> 01:34:20,120
A little... no, a lot.

1175
01:34:20,830 --> 01:34:23,080
Such hatred... so soon?
Give me a chance...

1176
01:34:23,160 --> 01:34:26,660
Hating you is
completely justified...

1177
01:34:26,990 --> 01:34:29,950
Because I still love Saba...

1178
01:34:32,370 --> 01:34:34,660
I gave your love a chance...

1179
01:34:35,040 --> 01:34:38,120
It's time for you to
give my friendship a chance.

1180
01:34:39,490 --> 01:34:40,830
Isn't that hard?

1181
01:34:41,160 --> 01:34:42,160
- What?

1182
01:34:42,660 --> 01:34:46,370
To love someone...
who doesn't love you in return?

1183
01:34:51,160 --> 01:34:54,660
It's the most beautiful
feeling in the world...

1184
01:34:57,160 --> 01:35:00,030
- Doesn"t it make you feel weak?
- Not at all.

1185
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:04,450
There's nothing like
the power of unrequited love...

1186
01:35:05,080 --> 01:35:08,410
Unlike other bonds,
it isn't shared...

1187
01:35:08,910 --> 01:35:11,530
It's mine...
and mine alone.

1188
01:35:14,870 --> 01:35:20,080
For a love like this,
I don't need Saba to love her...

1189
01:35:21,450 --> 01:35:23,660
There's no better love than that...

1190
01:35:26,700 --> 01:35:29,450
"'If you gamble in
the name of love...

1191
01:35:30,160 --> 01:35:32,950
"'Stake what you like...
what's to fear?"

1192
01:35:33,620 --> 01:35:35,990
"How wonderful if you win..."

1193
01:35:36,410 --> 01:35:41,080
"Even if you lose...
all is not lost.

1194
01:36:25,240 --> 01:36:26,740
Don't hang up!

1195
01:36:36,240 --> 01:36:38,280
Hello?

1196
01:36:38,370 --> 01:36:39,370
Shit!

1197
01:36:56,040 --> 01:36:57,780
- Hello?
- Ayan!

1198
01:36:58,910 --> 01:37:00,910
Where the hell are you?!

1199
01:37:01,080 --> 01:37:02,870
I've been trying to call you forever!

1200
01:37:02,990 --> 01:37:04,450
- You blocked my number!

1201
01:37:04,540 --> 01:37:05,700
What did you think I'd do?

1202
01:37:05,870 --> 01:37:07,080
Walk you down the aisle?

1203
01:37:07,910 --> 01:37:08,950
Did you marry him?

1204
01:37:11,120 --> 01:37:11,990
Yeah... I did.

1205
01:37:12,080 --> 01:37:13,490
Congratulations!

1206
01:37:14,580 --> 01:37:17,030
Now you're Mrs. DJ Ali!

1207
01:37:17,240 --> 01:37:20,370
Must be stuck on
him like headphones...

1208
01:37:21,200 --> 01:37:23,240
Ayan, stop your crap
before I hang up.

1209
01:37:23,450 --> 01:37:25,870
Hello!
You don't scare me!

1210
01:37:26,040 --> 01:37:27,200
Control yourself!

1211
01:37:27,660 --> 01:37:29,370
I have a girlfriend now.

1212
01:37:30,160 --> 01:37:32,740
She's really hot!

1213
01:37:33,200 --> 01:37:34,370
- And she writes poetry...

1214
01:37:34,450 --> 01:37:36,120
- You'll never get it!

1215
01:37:38,330 --> 01:37:39,490
Are you jealous?

1216
01:37:40,700 --> 01:37:42,200
- I think you're jealous.

1217
01:37:45,370 --> 01:37:46,740
No, dude...

1218
01:37:47,740 --> 01:37:51,700
I'm just really glad you called.

1219
01:37:51,910 --> 01:37:54,450
I'm so happy!

1220
01:37:56,740 --> 01:38:01,120
I have to go back
to my dinner date now...

1221
01:38:02,120 --> 01:38:05,370
- Candlelit... Romantic!

1222
01:38:05,620 --> 01:38:07,620
Ayan, listen...

1223
01:38:08,830 --> 01:38:10,490
I really missed you.

1224
01:38:12,740 --> 01:38:13,870
I hate you.

1225
01:38:15,080 --> 01:38:17,370
Okay...
But I missed you...

1226
01:38:20,490 --> 01:38:21,330
Bye.

1227
01:38:42,290 --> 01:38:44,580
'This is Saba... My girlfriend.'

1228
01:38:45,620 --> 01:38:46,280
'Wow...'

1229
01:38:46,740 --> 01:38:48,780
'What's she doing with you?!'

1230
01:38:48,870 --> 01:38:50,030
'She's gorgeous!'

1231
01:38:50,160 --> 01:38:52,200
'Yeah... Way better than you.'

1232
01:38:52,950 --> 01:38:54,450
- 'Like it’s a competition!'
- 'Of course it is!'

1233
01:38:54,830 --> 01:38:58,700
'Is DJ Ali still handsome
or did my curses work?'

1234
01:38:58,870 --> 01:39:00,200
'My prayers worked!

1235
01:39:00,540 --> 01:39:01,700
'Are you happy?

1236
01:39:05,490 --> 01:39:06,910
'Yeah... I'm happy.

1237
01:39:08,200 --> 01:39:10,330
"Feels like I'm finally
a part of Ali's life...'

1238
01:39:11,040 --> 01:39:13,410
'Our lives are wrapped in luggage...'

1239
01:39:14,540 --> 01:39:16,990
'And hotel rooms are home...'

1240
01:39:19,080 --> 01:39:20,280
'But it's nice.

1241
01:39:23,240 --> 01:39:26,240
"There's the occasional
dark cloud...'

1242
01:39:27,080 --> 01:39:29,030
'But other than that,
the sun is always shining.'

1243
01:39:30,580 --> 01:39:32,370
'I'm really, really happy.'

1244
01:39:33,740 --> 01:39:35,330
'I hate you.

1245
01:39:48,290 --> 01:39:50,240
'I'm coming to Vienna!'

1246
01:39:50,410 --> 01:39:51,660
'What plans?'

1247
01:39:52,700 --> 01:39:54,160
'I'm very busy...

1248
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:56,330
'Meetings, appointments...'

1249
01:39:56,370 --> 01:39:57,870
'Shuddap! You're free!'

1250
01:39:58,200 --> 01:39:59,410
'Okay, I am!'

1251
01:39:59,490 --> 01:40:02,620
'Saba and I would
love to host you...'

1252
01:40:02,740 --> 01:40:04,950
'...but leave that DJ Ali behind.'

1253
01:40:05,080 --> 01:40:07,830
"He has a concert,
anyway... I'll be there!

1254
01:40:15,790 --> 01:40:17,200
- Hi!
- Hi!

1255
01:40:25,620 --> 01:40:28,450
You're dying to wait
by the window...

1256
01:40:29,120 --> 01:40:31,910
Check if she called...
Walk around restlessly...

1257
01:40:32,240 --> 01:40:34,950
You're not fooling
anyone with this pose...

1258
01:40:35,160 --> 01:40:37,330
What? Me? Why?
I'm totally chill...

1259
01:40:37,410 --> 01:40:38,660
I'm cool!

1260
01:40:39,620 --> 01:40:41,410
Someone's at the door...

1261
01:40:42,580 --> 01:40:44,200
Go... She's here.

1262
01:40:50,370 --> 01:40:51,450
Hi!

1263
01:40:51,620 --> 01:40:52,580
Ayan!

1264
01:40:52,700 --> 01:40:54,370
Hi... Cold outside?

1265
01:40:55,490 --> 01:40:56,700
What are you doing?

1266
01:40:56,990 --> 01:40:59,160
Didn't bring any wine?
Flowers? Thorns? Nothing?

1267
01:40:59,240 --> 01:41:00,120
Should I have?

1268
01:41:00,200 --> 01:41:01,280
Saba!

1269
01:41:01,830 --> 01:41:02,580
Alizeh.

1270
01:41:04,290 --> 01:41:05,450
Welcome home...

1271
01:41:05,620 --> 01:41:07,240
- So Alizeh...
- So nice to meet you...

1272
01:41:07,330 --> 01:41:09,950
Heard so much about you...
All good things, I hope!

1273
01:41:11,540 --> 01:41:12,580
What...?

1274
01:41:12,660 --> 01:41:16,330
No... just... trying to
ease the tension!

1275
01:41:16,580 --> 01:41:17,870
Get a hold on yourself...

1276
01:41:17,950 --> 01:41:20,740
The "tension' will disappear?
Come...

1277
01:41:20,950 --> 01:41:23,580
- You know how girls can be!
- Sexist remark...

1278
01:41:23,700 --> 01:41:26,030
- Not appreciated!
- Not at all!

1279
01:41:26,200 --> 01:41:29,410
Give our intelligence its due!

1280
01:41:32,080 --> 01:41:32,990
Wine?

1281
01:41:33,080 --> 01:41:34,370
Maybe later...

1282
01:41:34,450 --> 01:41:35,530
Ah, okay...

1283
01:41:35,620 --> 01:41:36,780
But, Saba...

1284
01:41:36,870 --> 01:41:40,780
Beauty like yours often
overshadows intelligence...

1285
01:41:41,080 --> 01:41:44,030
Ask those of us who
live off our personality...

1286
01:41:44,160 --> 01:41:46,120
Beauty fades, Alizeh...

1287
01:41:46,330 --> 01:41:48,950
But Death, himself,
can't kill personality...

1288
01:41:49,240 --> 01:41:52,830
Wow... So the poetry
really was yours!

1289
01:41:53,080 --> 01:41:57,240
I thought Ayan was just
copying it off the internet!

1290
01:41:58,660 --> 01:42:00,580
If it weren't for poetry...

1291
01:42:00,910 --> 01:42:03,410
...I'd have died a thousand
living deaths already...

1292
01:42:05,330 --> 01:42:06,330
Cheese?

1293
01:42:09,950 --> 01:42:14,080
Will I sound phony
if I praise you some more?

1294
01:42:14,580 --> 01:42:16,700
Not at all...
Please go ahead...

1295
01:42:16,790 --> 01:42:18,080
No judgments!

1296
01:42:18,620 --> 01:42:20,200
Pictures do you no justice...

1297
01:42:20,290 --> 01:42:22,490
You're even more
beautiful in person.

1298
01:42:24,660 --> 01:42:28,200
Oh, so those pictures
were to show you...

1299
01:42:29,240 --> 01:42:31,280
To make her jealous...

1300
01:42:31,740 --> 01:42:33,700
...but why waste
envy on the resentful?

1301
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:35,120
Wow, Ayan...

1302
01:42:35,200 --> 01:42:37,030
Saba, looks like you've
had an influence...

1303
01:42:37,330 --> 01:42:38,200
A little bit of it...

1304
01:42:38,290 --> 01:42:39,450
A little to go...

1305
01:42:43,620 --> 01:42:45,080
Well, it's not envy...

1306
01:42:45,330 --> 01:42:47,780
But you can’t sing
to a mute person....

1307
01:42:47,870 --> 01:42:49,660
...and expect them
not to feel inferior!

1308
01:42:51,700 --> 01:42:55,990
Speaking of singing...
This is my favourite song...

1309
01:42:56,200 --> 01:43:00,030
"'O lover, don't ask me
to love like I did before..."

1310
01:43:00,700 --> 01:43:02,870
"'O lover, don't ask me..."

1311
01:43:03,290 --> 01:43:04,830
To love like I did before.

1312
01:43:15,200 --> 01:43:15,910
Dinner?

1313
01:43:16,580 --> 01:43:17,240
Bread?

1314
01:43:23,620 --> 01:43:24,950
Why didn't you bring Ali?

1315
01:43:26,080 --> 01:43:28,120
He had a concert... so...

1316
01:43:28,490 --> 01:43:30,410
DJ Ali's super busy, you see...

1317
01:43:32,080 --> 01:43:35,200
Why do you keep calling him that?
Like it's an insult...

1318
01:43:35,330 --> 01:43:36,620
Not at all!

1319
01:43:37,040 --> 01:43:40,950
Who doesn"t dream of making
people dance on their fingertips?

1320
01:43:43,160 --> 01:43:45,240
Alizeh, may I ask
you something personal?

1321
01:43:45,330 --> 01:43:47,080
If you don't mind...

1322
01:43:47,370 --> 01:43:48,740
Sure...

1323
01:43:50,240 --> 01:43:54,030
How did you not fall in love
with someone so charming?

1324
01:44:00,290 --> 01:44:01,990
Charming for you, maybe...

1325
01:44:02,200 --> 01:44:04,660
He was a big baby
when I met him...

1326
01:44:05,330 --> 01:44:09,490
He cried on the streets,
cried in my arms...

1327
01:44:09,580 --> 01:44:10,910
Really?!

1328
01:44:11,490 --> 01:44:15,160
Ayan... Is this a compliment
or a slight?

1329
01:44:15,450 --> 01:44:17,410
You've never cried in my arms...

1330
01:44:18,540 --> 01:44:20,870
How could I cry in your arms...

1331
01:44:22,290 --> 01:44:24,740
...when I'm so distracted by
my other feelings...

1332
01:45:08,580 --> 01:45:10,530
You got lucky, Ayan!

1333
01:45:11,330 --> 01:45:13,660
Saba's wonderful.

1334
01:45:21,240 --> 01:45:22,200
Anyway...

1335
01:45:22,950 --> 01:45:24,530
- Thank you for dinner.
- Go to hell!

1336
01:45:25,200 --> 01:45:27,120
'Thank you for dinner'?!

1337
01:45:29,790 --> 01:45:30,910
You're soulless!

1338
01:45:31,450 --> 01:45:33,240
Don't you have any feelings?!

1339
01:45:33,870 --> 01:45:35,950
Not jealousy, not guilt...

1340
01:45:36,240 --> 01:45:39,330
- Nothing?!
- I feel everything, Ayan!

1341
01:45:40,120 --> 01:45:41,910
But you’d never
understand if I told you...

1342
01:45:41,990 --> 01:45:43,490
You'd just misconstrue it all!

1343
01:45:44,990 --> 01:45:46,530
You're a goddamn child!

1344
01:45:46,790 --> 01:45:48,280
You've got everything!

1345
01:45:48,740 --> 01:45:51,160
Goals, passion,
a relationship...

1346
01:45:51,290 --> 01:45:52,410
Why are you still so stubborn?!

1347
01:45:52,490 --> 01:45:53,410
Because I am!

1348
01:45:53,700 --> 01:45:55,530
I'm stubborn
because it's my heart!

1349
01:45:55,910 --> 01:45:58,370
What are you going
to do about it?!

1350
01:46:05,700 --> 01:46:07,490
Why can't you love me?

1351
01:46:10,870 --> 01:46:14,030
I do love you, Ayan...

1352
01:46:16,540 --> 01:46:19,240
Just not the way
you want me to...

1353
01:46:20,830 --> 01:46:22,030
Why?

1354
01:46:23,410 --> 01:46:26,240
I can't... Please...

1355
01:46:36,540 --> 01:46:39,120
- I don’t want to be selfish, Ayan-
- Get lost.

1356
01:47:21,040 --> 01:47:22,120
It's over, Ayan.

1357
01:47:24,740 --> 01:47:25,950
It's over.

1358
01:47:40,740 --> 01:47:42,160
I lied...

1359
01:47:45,200 --> 01:47:46,530
First to you...

1360
01:47:49,950 --> 01:47:51,370
...then to myself.

1361
01:47:54,790 --> 01:47:57,870
I lied that I don't
have place for love...

1362
01:48:06,080 --> 01:48:09,740
I'm falling in love
with you, Ayan...

1363
01:48:12,740 --> 01:48:17,030
And today, I finally understood
that you can never love me...

1364
01:48:17,700 --> 01:48:19,830
...the way you love Alizeh...

1365
01:48:22,700 --> 01:48:24,200
And still...

1366
01:48:26,160 --> 01:48:27,700
I love you...

1367
01:48:34,120 --> 01:48:35,280
What do I do?

1368
01:48:36,120 --> 01:48:38,830
Saba, you've always known...

1369
01:48:39,790 --> 01:48:43,490
I can't do this, Ayan...

1370
01:48:46,120 --> 01:48:49,240
I've been down this road...

1371
01:48:50,830 --> 01:48:52,370
It's broken me once before...

1372
01:48:54,490 --> 01:48:55,490
Saba...

1373
01:48:57,120 --> 01:49:00,990
Please don't try to
change my mind...

1374
01:49:03,290 --> 01:49:05,240
If you try...

1375
01:49:07,660 --> 01:49:09,330
I'll give in...

1376
01:49:11,660 --> 01:49:13,330
If I give in...

1377
01:49:16,660 --> 01:49:18,030
I'll fall apart again...

1378
01:49:22,410 --> 01:49:25,370
We can't choose who
to fall in love with...

1379
01:49:28,370 --> 01:49:33,240
But we can choose
when to walk away.

1380
01:49:35,240 --> 01:49:36,910
Go, Ayan...

1381
01:49:37,830 --> 01:49:39,200
Go...

1382
01:51:01,240 --> 01:51:02,580
Let me go...

1383
01:51:04,370 --> 01:51:05,530
Please...

1384
01:51:06,990 --> 01:51:09,330
Please... let me go...

1385
01:51:12,540 --> 01:51:14,530
I can't go on like this...

1386
01:51:18,950 --> 01:51:21,240
So I have to go, okay?

1387
01:51:21,910 --> 01:51:24,240
Okay?!

1388
01:51:26,450 --> 01:51:28,030
I have to go...

1389
01:51:33,290 --> 01:51:35,200
If I can't do it...

1390
01:51:35,290 --> 01:51:37,330
...then you have to be
the stronger one.

1391
01:51:38,290 --> 01:51:39,370
Okay?

1392
01:51:40,790 --> 01:51:44,030
- Okay?
- Okay...

1393
01:52:46,800 --> 01:52:48,800
You are my journey

1394
01:52:50,800 --> 01:52:53,800
You are my destination

1395
01:52:54,800 --> 01:52:57,800
Surviving with you...

1396
01:52:58,810 --> 01:53:01,810
O my beating heart, it's difficult!

1397
01:53:02,810 --> 01:53:04,810
You are my God

1398
01:53:05,810 --> 01:53:08,810
You are in my prayers

1399
01:53:09,810 --> 01:53:13,810
Surviving without you...

1400
01:53:14,810 --> 01:53:17,810
O my beating heart, it's difficult!

1401
01:53:18,810 --> 01:53:24,810
Your absence tests me

1402
01:53:25,810 --> 01:53:32,810
For everything I lack, you complete me

1403
01:53:33,810 --> 01:53:35,810
It is my obsession

1404
01:53:36,810 --> 01:53:40,810
To become worthy of you

1405
01:53:41,810 --> 01:53:43,810
Surviving without you...

1406
01:53:44,820 --> 01:53:49,820
O my beating heart, it's difficult!

1407
01:54:03,820 --> 01:54:10,820
This soul of mine, this body of mine

1408
01:54:11,820 --> 01:54:18,820
Isn't as much mine, as it has become yours

1409
01:54:19,820 --> 01:54:25,820
I accept the pain you haven given me

1410
01:54:26,820 --> 01:54:34,820
From you, it has become my reward

1411
01:54:35,820 --> 01:54:41,820
My sky searches for your ground

1412
01:54:42,820 --> 01:54:49,820
For everything I lack, you are
necessary to complete me

1413
01:54:50,820 --> 01:54:53,820
If not on the earth,

1414
01:54:54,820 --> 01:54:57,820
Meet me in heaven

1415
01:54:58,820 --> 01:55:01,820
Surviving without you...

1416
01:55:02,830 --> 01:55:06,830
O my beating heart, it's difficult!

1417
01:55:34,830 --> 01:55:38,830
I agree, my life is devoid...

1418
01:55:39,830 --> 01:55:42,830
...of your presence

1419
01:55:43,830 --> 01:55:46,830
My heart doesn't know...

1420
01:55:47,830 --> 01:55:50,830
...any other way to live without you

1421
01:55:51,830 --> 01:55:54,830
My dedication to your love,

1422
01:55:55,830 --> 01:55:57,830
If you wish, please be blind to it.

1423
01:55:58,830 --> 01:56:01,830
Independent of the destination,

1424
01:56:02,830 --> 01:56:05,830
This is a one-sided journey of mine.

1425
01:56:06,830 --> 01:56:12,830
...Which is more beautiful than the destination...

1426
01:56:13,840 --> 01:56:20,840
For everything I lack, you are
necessary to complete me.

1427
01:56:21,840 --> 01:56:24,840
Even though incomplete,

1428
01:56:25,840 --> 01:56:28,840
My love for you is perfect.

1429
01:56:29,840 --> 01:56:32,840
Living life without you...

1430
01:56:33,840 --> 01:56:36,840
O my beating heart, it's difficult!

1431
01:56:37,840 --> 01:56:43,840
Your absence, tests me...

1432
01:56:44,840 --> 01:56:51,840
For everything I lack, you are
necessary to complete me...

1433
01:57:34,240 --> 01:57:36,450
Thanks...
Good job on the mix!

1434
01:57:40,740 --> 01:57:41,950
Thanks.

1435
01:57:58,660 --> 01:57:59,870
Hey, Ayan!

1436
01:58:01,040 --> 01:58:02,660
- Hey, Ali!
- What's up, man?

1437
01:58:03,620 --> 01:58:05,870
- Avoiding me?
- Avoid... no...

1438
01:58:06,240 --> 01:58:07,740
Congratulations...
You sang really well...

1439
01:58:07,950 --> 01:58:08,780
Thanks...

1440
01:58:09,790 --> 01:58:11,080
Looks like you're doing well...

1441
01:58:11,200 --> 01:58:14,240
Well, I couldn't be
Mohammad Rafi...

1442
01:58:14,540 --> 01:58:16,870
...but I've found some
love on the internet...

1443
01:58:17,200 --> 01:58:18,330
Great...

1444
01:58:19,370 --> 01:58:21,990
- All good, otherwise?
- Yeah, all good... Superb...

1445
01:58:26,990 --> 01:58:28,160
Sorry...

1446
01:58:28,450 --> 01:58:30,580
I'm finding this
formality really funny...

1447
01:58:32,120 --> 01:58:35,280
The truth is that I'd been
hoping to run into you...

1448
01:58:35,540 --> 01:58:37,120
So I could beat you up...

1449
01:58:38,870 --> 01:58:42,120
You have no idea how much
I wanted to beat you up, DJ Ali!

1450
01:58:43,990 --> 01:58:44,910
Nice...

1451
01:58:45,580 --> 01:58:46,950
Why'd you feel that way?

1452
01:58:47,330 --> 01:58:48,700
Because of how you felt.

1453
01:58:51,160 --> 01:58:54,330
Your love was so strong that
mine couldn't live up to it.

1454
01:58:55,120 --> 01:58:56,910
What else have
I ever done...

1455
01:58:57,160 --> 01:58:59,580
Sang some songs...
and fell in love.

1456
01:59:01,080 --> 01:59:02,410
You're fortunate...

1457
01:59:03,290 --> 01:59:06,580
Not everyone can love
so faithfully...

1458
01:59:09,700 --> 01:59:10,950
How's Alizeh doing?

1459
01:59:17,950 --> 01:59:19,410
You're serious?
You don't know?

1460
01:59:19,910 --> 01:59:21,410
I don't know... what?

1461
01:59:24,580 --> 01:59:25,950
Congratulations, man...

1462
01:59:26,200 --> 01:59:27,490
She left me.

1463
01:59:35,990 --> 01:59:38,450
Maybe I couldn't love
her the way she wanted me to...

1464
01:59:39,540 --> 01:59:41,160
I haven't seen her in two years...

1465
01:59:42,200 --> 01:59:44,490
Even her parents
haven't heard from her.

1466
01:59:44,830 --> 01:59:49,120
Last I heard, she was in London,
but I don't have the details...

1467
01:59:50,410 --> 01:59:52,080
Why didn't she call you?

1468
02:00:09,870 --> 02:00:12,580
Everyone knows love is crooked...

1469
02:00:13,160 --> 02:00:15,580
But to find peace
in that crooked love...

1470
02:00:15,740 --> 02:00:17,450
...is a gift only few have.

1471
02:00:18,200 --> 02:00:19,080
- 'This?!

1472
02:00:19,450 --> 02:00:21,240
'This is my happy place!'

1473
02:00:22,330 --> 02:00:24,580
And when there's nothing left...

1474
02:00:25,410 --> 02:00:28,120
...they find shelter
in that crookedness...

1475
02:00:28,620 --> 02:00:32,240
"I come here when the
world gets too much...'

1476
02:00:33,240 --> 02:00:34,530
Crooked love.

1477
02:00:34,740 --> 02:00:37,830
'When I want to spend
time with myself...'

1478
02:00:38,290 --> 02:00:42,120
"Because this is the only
place on earth that knows...

1479
02:00:42,200 --> 02:00:44,030
'...that love is crooked...

1480
02:00:44,700 --> 02:00:45,700
'Crooked.

1481
02:02:02,290 --> 02:02:03,370
Ayan?

1482
02:02:07,370 --> 02:02:08,530
Ayan?!

1483
02:02:17,990 --> 02:02:19,030
Hi!

1484
02:02:31,950 --> 02:02:33,160
Where have you been?!

1485
02:02:33,540 --> 02:02:39,830
Where the hell were you?!

1486
02:02:40,160 --> 02:02:42,910
No one has a clue
where you are...

1487
02:02:43,490 --> 02:02:44,990
Who are you?

1488
02:02:45,910 --> 02:02:48,240
Malaysian Airlines?

1489
02:02:48,330 --> 02:02:51,580
You think it'll make a
difference if you disappear?!

1490
02:02:52,620 --> 02:02:55,080
I've been lying here for
2 days like a homeless man...

1491
02:02:55,200 --> 02:02:56,870
I'm frozen through!

1492
02:02:56,990 --> 02:03:00,080
This is the cone and
this is the ice cream!

1493
02:03:00,990 --> 02:03:03,780
Haven't eaten, haven't slept...
Not used the loo for any business!

1494
02:03:03,910 --> 02:03:05,830
What if you'd showed up?!

1495
02:03:05,910 --> 02:03:07,950
- Where the hell were you?!
- Slap you!

1496
02:03:14,040 --> 02:03:15,580
Why'd you shake your head?!

1497
02:03:21,120 --> 02:03:22,450
Why are you bald?!

1498
02:03:23,290 --> 02:03:24,910
I'm dying, you idiot!

1499
02:03:29,330 --> 02:03:30,240
Means?

1500
02:03:33,740 --> 02:03:36,120
What?!

1501
02:03:39,450 --> 02:03:40,620
At least give me a hug!

1502
02:03:49,700 --> 02:03:51,240
Dying means what?

1503
02:03:51,870 --> 02:03:53,530
What do you mean dying?!

1504
02:04:04,700 --> 02:04:06,490
Love is like cancer.

1505
02:04:07,660 --> 02:04:09,530
Comes without warning...

1506
02:04:09,990 --> 02:04:11,990
...and destroys you in its wake.

1507
02:04:14,160 --> 02:04:16,450
This can't be happening, Alizeh...

1508
02:04:19,450 --> 02:04:22,780
Well... It's happened.

1509
02:04:28,490 --> 02:04:31,490
I thought I was so cool...

1510
02:04:33,200 --> 02:04:35,990
Love turned me
into such a loser.

1511
02:04:39,660 --> 02:04:42,330
Ali was making me act insane...

1512
02:04:42,740 --> 02:04:45,700
From checking his phone,
to following him around...

1513
02:04:47,040 --> 02:04:50,830
- I'd stopped being his wife
to act like a parole officer.

1514
02:04:52,700 --> 02:04:55,080
I can't even really complain...

1515
02:04:58,200 --> 02:05:00,870
I was even willing
to overlook the cheating...

1516
02:05:02,870 --> 02:05:04,370
Thankfully...

1517
02:05:05,200 --> 02:05:08,370
I finally gathered the
last shreds of my dignity...

1518
02:05:10,830 --> 02:05:12,120
...and left him.

1519
02:05:12,990 --> 02:05:16,280
- I decided that my husband does
not control my self-worth.

1520
02:05:16,540 --> 02:05:22,450
All that anger, hatred,
balled up in my throat...

1521
02:05:24,740 --> 02:05:27,490
I dismissed it as an
effect of the circumstance...

1522
02:05:28,790 --> 02:05:30,950
The doctors called it cancer.

1523
02:05:31,160 --> 02:05:33,280
- Straight to 4th stage!

1524
02:05:34,290 --> 02:05:40,080
I never even scored
that high in school, man!

1525
02:05:41,990 --> 02:05:44,080
But look at you!

1526
02:05:44,540 --> 02:05:48,780
You've gone from just
Ayan Sanger to Mr. Ayan Singer!

1527
02:05:52,080 --> 02:05:56,330
If you even think of dying...
I'll kill you.

1528
02:05:58,620 --> 02:06:02,280
Now that you're here...
I don't ever want to die.

1529
02:06:49,830 --> 02:06:50,950
So, what will you have?

1530
02:06:51,120 --> 02:06:54,450
Hi... Just some muesli
with strawberries, please.

1531
02:06:54,540 --> 02:06:57,030
- Muesli with strawberries...

1532
02:06:57,200 --> 02:06:58,950
- And how about you?

1533
02:06:59,540 --> 02:07:00,660
Same!

1534
02:07:01,120 --> 02:07:02,450
- Okay!

1535
02:07:13,790 --> 02:07:16,450
Oh, nothing...
Just donated my hair online...

1536
02:07:17,370 --> 02:07:19,370
iBhakti.com?

1537
02:07:19,790 --> 02:07:23,280
May this bald head shower
you with blessings...

1538
02:07:25,160 --> 02:07:26,160
Cool.

1539
02:07:39,080 --> 02:07:40,450
Seriously?

1540
02:07:41,450 --> 02:07:44,330
You call that a reaction?
So low-key?

1541
02:07:44,740 --> 02:07:49,620
Alizeh, I just donated my hair...
And you're giving me an Irfan Khan stare?

1542
02:07:50,620 --> 02:07:52,780
A little over-the-top won't hurt!

1543
02:07:53,490 --> 02:07:55,580
Ayan, have you gone nuts?

1544
02:07:56,490 --> 02:07:58,200
Take a look at yourself!

1545
02:07:59,620 --> 02:08:01,530
You look hot, man!

1546
02:08:01,990 --> 02:08:02,910
Hot!

1547
02:08:03,540 --> 02:08:06,910
You'll be fighting girls off...
We'll have to call security!

1548
02:08:09,740 --> 02:08:11,200
Seriously?!

1549
02:08:12,830 --> 02:08:14,620
- Really?!
- Yeah!

1550
02:08:17,160 --> 02:08:19,580
- Should I come there to try my luck?
- Come on over!

1551
02:08:23,700 --> 02:08:25,330
You're mad!

1552
02:08:28,990 --> 02:08:31,080
Goodbye, hairbrush!

1553
02:08:33,540 --> 02:08:34,530
Now, listen...

1554
02:08:35,790 --> 02:08:37,280
I have no real religion...

1555
02:08:37,490 --> 02:08:39,200
But I only believe in one religion.

1556
02:08:40,120 --> 02:08:41,240
R.D. Burman's music!

1557
02:08:42,660 --> 02:08:47,580
If we both look like Captain Picard anyway...
let the Starship Enterprise fly!

1558
02:08:48,450 --> 02:08:51,870
We're young, we’re free
and we're ready...

1559
02:08:52,080 --> 02:08:54,280
...to let the freak flag fly...

1560
02:08:54,370 --> 02:08:56,700
...with Jolly Good Bollywood!

1561
02:12:33,830 --> 02:12:36,200
Your tea, madam!

1562
02:12:37,330 --> 02:12:39,660
Careful, it's hot!

1563
02:12:44,830 --> 02:12:46,490
- Did it burn you?
- A little...

1564
02:12:54,290 --> 02:12:55,870
- Hi...
- Hi!

1565
02:13:17,540 --> 02:13:18,410
Ayan...

1566
02:13:20,490 --> 02:13:22,120
Sorry...

1567
02:13:32,580 --> 02:13:35,240
Actually, sorry but I'm not sorry.

1568
02:13:37,370 --> 02:13:39,240
What do you want from me?

1569
02:13:40,740 --> 02:13:41,910
What do I do?

1570
02:13:43,120 --> 02:13:46,120
You think I'm dying
to sleep with you...

1571
02:13:49,660 --> 02:13:52,280
I'm dying for you to love me...

1572
02:13:53,580 --> 02:13:54,830
I've tried everything...

1573
02:13:54,910 --> 02:13:58,330
Staying away, staying close,
another relationship...

1574
02:13:58,410 --> 02:14:02,530
But I can't...
I can't get you out of my head!

1575
02:14:05,990 --> 02:14:08,700
What does DJ Ali have that I don't?

1576
02:14:10,200 --> 02:14:14,580
If I get some tattoos
and start spouting poetry...

1577
02:14:14,660 --> 02:14:16,450
Will you love me then?

1578
02:14:17,540 --> 02:14:21,700
Will I finally be worthy of your love?

1579
02:14:22,370 --> 02:14:23,910
Because I'll do it.

1580
02:14:24,490 --> 02:14:25,990
I can do it.

1581
02:14:32,330 --> 02:14:33,910
I'm talking to you.

1582
02:14:34,910 --> 02:14:36,580
Yeah, run away...

1583
02:14:37,490 --> 02:14:39,410
Not like you have anything to say...

1584
02:14:39,910 --> 02:14:41,030
Alizeh...

1585
02:14:45,870 --> 02:14:48,030
- I can break things, too!
- That's a pressure cooker!

1586
02:14:48,120 --> 02:14:50,030
Let it burst then!

1587
02:14:51,580 --> 02:14:53,120
What do you want me to do?!

1588
02:14:53,330 --> 02:14:54,950
- Lie to you?
- Yes, lie to me!

1589
02:14:55,080 --> 02:14:57,490
- I can’t lie!
- Why not?! You're dying, anyway!

1590
02:14:57,580 --> 02:15:00,200
Live or die, I will not lie to you!

1591
02:15:00,240 --> 02:15:04,120
This is the only honest thing
in my life, Ayan!

1592
02:15:04,290 --> 02:15:06,120
Can’t you love me
instead of DJ Ali?

1593
02:15:07,740 --> 02:15:09,700
This IS love, Ayan...

1594
02:15:09,910 --> 02:15:14,240
- This isn’t love.
- This IS love for me, Ayan!

1595
02:15:14,830 --> 02:15:21,080
Ayan, this is bigger than love...
This is the greatest love of my life.

1596
02:15:22,160 --> 02:15:23,830
I don't want this kind of love.

1597
02:15:24,790 --> 02:15:28,280
You're my friend...

1598
02:15:28,580 --> 02:15:30,450
My family...

1599
02:15:30,830 --> 02:15:32,330
My everything!

1600
02:15:32,580 --> 02:15:34,030
You're just not my lover.

1601
02:15:34,370 --> 02:15:37,530
Why not?
I can be your lover, too!

1602
02:15:37,620 --> 02:15:38,950
Ayan!!

1603
02:15:39,620 --> 02:15:42,370
That kind of love has only destroyed me...
Do you want to be destroyed?!

1604
02:15:42,450 --> 02:15:46,620
Yes, I do.
I want to be destroyed.

1605
02:15:47,200 --> 02:15:50,370
This thing we have between us...
Our friendship...

1606
02:15:50,660 --> 02:15:52,950
It's my greatest strength.

1607
02:15:53,540 --> 02:15:55,910
Love is my weakness...

1608
02:15:56,580 --> 02:15:58,700
Why don't you understand that?

1609
02:15:58,950 --> 02:16:03,660
Because a man and a woman
cannot be just friends!

1610
02:16:15,040 --> 02:16:16,990
Go...

1611
02:16:17,160 --> 02:16:18,780
Get out of here...

1612
02:16:19,490 --> 02:16:20,740
Go.

1613
02:16:20,910 --> 02:16:24,160
I can't explain this to you anymore...

1614
02:16:24,240 --> 02:16:27,660
If you can't understand, just leave...

1615
02:16:27,910 --> 02:16:31,120
Take your stuff and get out!

1616
02:16:32,790 --> 02:16:33,870
Get out!

1617
02:16:33,990 --> 02:16:35,660
Get out, Ayan!

1618
02:16:42,830 --> 02:16:43,910
Alizeh...

1619
02:16:45,910 --> 02:16:47,330
Alizeh, I'm sorry...

1620
02:16:58,580 --> 02:17:01,450
It’s a strange story...
of Love and Friendship.

1621
02:17:01,950 --> 02:17:04,660
Love, the hero...
and Friendship, the heroine.

1622
02:17:05,120 --> 02:17:08,200
The awful thing is that
Love never understood Friendship.

1623
02:17:08,410 --> 02:17:12,740
'I do love you, Ayan...
Just not the way you want me to.

1624
02:17:13,040 --> 02:17:14,870
- 'Love is passion...'

1625
02:17:15,700 --> 02:17:18,780
- '...but friendship is peace.'

1626
02:17:21,740 --> 02:17:26,330
One night, tired and weary,
Love threw a tantrum...

1627
02:17:27,120 --> 02:17:28,700
Like a spoilt child... Stupid!

1628
02:17:29,080 --> 02:17:30,910
And what did Friendship do?

1629
02:17:32,910 --> 02:17:33,870
Alizeh...

1630
02:17:34,240 --> 02:17:37,330
Friendship threw a tantrum, too,
and left in a huff.

1631
02:17:40,950 --> 02:17:43,080
And where else do heroines go?

1632
02:17:43,870 --> 02:17:44,780
The airport.

1633
02:17:45,290 --> 02:17:48,120
- 'Ayan... I'm going back home...'

1634
02:17:48,410 --> 02:17:50,490
And Love freaked out...

1635
02:17:50,660 --> 02:17:54,280
- 'I hope one day you’ll
understand my love...

1636
02:17:54,580 --> 02:17:58,280
When Love realised that Friendship
is leaving him forever... He ran.

1637
02:17:58,660 --> 02:18:01,450
And how he ran!

1638
02:18:06,490 --> 02:18:07,370
In taxis...

1639
02:18:07,580 --> 02:18:08,620
Heathrow Airport!

1640
02:18:11,660 --> 02:18:12,740
In trains...

1641
02:18:16,950 --> 02:18:18,410
He ran!

1642
02:18:21,120 --> 02:18:23,030
He didn't stop to breathe...

1643
02:18:24,330 --> 02:18:28,030
Because Love knew...
Friendship was about to breathe her last...

1644
02:18:29,080 --> 02:18:32,330
And he wanted to be with
her 'til her last moments.

1645
02:18:33,120 --> 02:18:34,450
That was Love's right.

1646
02:18:45,620 --> 02:18:47,950
I need to get to BA 1 09!

1647
02:18:49,660 --> 02:18:51,990
I'm sorry, the gate closed
20 minutes ago!

1648
02:18:52,080 --> 02:18:53,530
Has the flight taken off?

1649
02:18:53,700 --> 02:18:55,030
It's about to go!

1650
02:19:02,040 --> 02:19:03,410
- Hello?
- Alizeh!

1651
02:19:03,620 --> 02:19:05,620
I'm at the airport!
I'm here!

1652
02:19:05,950 --> 02:19:07,740
Please don't go Alizeh, please stay!

1653
02:19:09,790 --> 02:19:12,330
Ayan, I'm taking off.

1654
02:19:53,200 --> 02:19:54,030
Hello?

1655
02:20:29,080 --> 02:20:30,030
Alizeh...

1656
02:20:31,240 --> 02:20:33,490
You can't die...

1657
02:20:38,620 --> 02:20:40,580
- Ma'am, keep that oxygen mask on.

1658
02:20:40,660 --> 02:20:43,740
Alizeh, listen to him...
Put it back.

1659
02:20:46,790 --> 02:20:48,160
Ayan...

1660
02:20:49,700 --> 02:20:52,330
I'm acting, I'm not really dying...

1661
02:20:52,740 --> 02:20:55,330
Don't react... We'll get caught.

1662
02:21:02,410 --> 02:21:05,370
How else do you runaway
from a runway?

1663
02:21:06,240 --> 02:21:09,030
Cancer's got to have some perks...

1664
02:21:14,830 --> 02:21:17,330
You came to the airport, Ayan...

1665
02:21:18,740 --> 02:21:21,410
You fulfilled my dream!

1666
02:21:23,160 --> 02:21:25,870
Alizeh, I'm sorry for last night...

1667
02:21:28,160 --> 02:21:32,280
Friendship doesn't know
sorry's and thank you's...

1668
02:21:36,580 --> 02:21:40,660
I swear I'll never trouble
you about this again...

1669
02:21:41,790 --> 02:21:43,530
Because, Ayan...

1670
02:21:44,370 --> 02:21:48,160
It's a lot like love!

1671
02:22:12,290 --> 02:22:14,700
Come, now, sing something...

1672
02:22:15,200 --> 02:22:17,910
Anything you like... I'm sick!

1673
02:22:39,080 --> 02:22:41,160
Hey... can I sing something?

1674
02:22:53,260 --> 02:22:55,260
In your presence,

1675
02:22:56,200 --> 02:22:58,200
...if I'm not there...

1676
02:22:59,200 --> 02:23:03,200
...there is no sadness!

1677
02:23:04,200 --> 02:23:10,200
Stories of us, & of our closeness...

1678
02:23:11,200 --> 02:23:14,200
...aren't any less than others!

1679
02:23:15,210 --> 02:23:20,210
So many times I have turned,

1680
02:23:21,210 --> 02:23:25,270
my mornings into evenings sitting in your courtyard.

1681
02:23:26,220 --> 02:23:34,610
Oh my moon...
Oh my beloved moon.

1682
02:23:37,170 --> 02:23:43,170
Oh my moon, my beloved moon
O my love...

1683
02:25:33,100 --> 02:25:37,100
I have done my share in loving someone

1684
02:25:38,100 --> 02:25:43,100
Even when you were there,
when we were together

1685
02:25:44,100 --> 02:25:48,100
To tell you the truth, I loved you...

1686
02:25:49,110 --> 02:25:53,110
...more than you did yourself,
even after you left.

1687
02:25:55,110 --> 02:25:59,110
I am the pain,

1688
02:26:00,110 --> 02:26:05,110
You're the cure, no?

1689
02:26:06,110 --> 02:26:10,110
I am the fire,

1690
02:26:11,110 --> 02:26:17,110
and you're the wind
(that gives rise to the fire)

1691
02:26:18,110 --> 02:26:20,110
Ali, Ali, Ali, Alizeh

1692
02:26:22,710 --> 02:26:24,110
Where are you?

1693
02:26:25,510 --> 02:26:28,110
You're there in my heart, no?

1694
02:26:33,110 --> 02:26:36,110
I'm yours!

1695
02:26:36,120 --> 02:26:39,120
You remember, no?

1696
02:27:12,120 --> 02:27:17,120
When the sun goes down, it feels like...

1697
02:27:18,120 --> 02:27:22,120
...your head is there on my shoulder.

1698
02:27:23,120 --> 02:27:28,120
Wherever I end up staying...

1699
02:27:29,120 --> 02:27:33,120
...in my memories, your home is there

1700
02:27:55,120 --> 02:28:05,120
Wherever I am, you are there, no?

1701
02:28:06,120 --> 02:28:16,120
I'm the fire, and you the wind, no?
