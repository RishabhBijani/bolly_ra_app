00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:56,750
<i>The sharp sting of separation
takes the breath away</i>

2
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:02,200
<i>Light the ember of love.</i>

3
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:03,750
<i>Set the heavens afire...</i>

4
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:07,830
<i>...O Mirzya</i>

5
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:32,250
<i>This is the alley of the blacksmiths</i>

6
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:34,410
<i>Their homes are here</i>

7
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:36,830
<i>The alley glows with eternal fire</i>

8
00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:00,160
<i>When hot iron melts here...</i>

9
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,750
<i>...golden embers float high</i>

10
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:45,120
<i>The furnace embers take wing</i>

11
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:50,500
<i>Like Time unfurling moments
from its fist</i>

12
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:58,870
<i>Then the warrior Mirza always
returns here</i>

13
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:05,120
<i>The blacksmiths' retells the tale
of his love for Sahiba</i>

14
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,410
<i>When their story is told in this alley</i>

15
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:13,700
<i>The sound of hooves lingers on</i>

16
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:30,870
<i>These valleys of milky mist</i>

17
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,750
<i>Centuries float through here</i>

18
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:40,620
<i>Love never dies, O Mirzya</i>

19
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:48,500
<i>Forever lives the beloved Sahiba</i>

20
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:10,080
<i>Others are armed with spears</i>

21
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:15,500
<i>Mirza with bow and arrow</i>

22
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:22,750
<i>There he comes, My Mirza</i>

23
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:28,580
<i>fearless like a lion</i>

24
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:11,620
O Mirzya

25
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:24,870
Mirzya

26
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,330
Coming!

27
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,620
Monish!

28
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:38,620
- I'm coming
- Hurry up!

29
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:43,580
Where is it?

30
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,200
Here

31
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,370
Give me your bag

32
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:06,250
- Your milk!
- Don't want any

33
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,660
You're always getting me late

34
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:20,000
- What were you doing?
- Target practice

35
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,370
Give me that

36
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:29,410
<i>Deep is the pain of separation</i>

37
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:31,450
<i>Life is a burning fire</i>

38
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:37,410
<i>Light the embers of love</i>

39
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:41,870
<i>Set the heavens alight,
O Mirzya</i>

40
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:46,500
<i>Speak up! So the sun melts</i>

41
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:50,160
<i>Let fire seedlings be born
to hear your legend...</i>

42
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,120
<i>...O Mirzya</i>

43
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:59,080
- I'll be right back
- What did you forget?

44
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,660
We'll miss the bus. Hurry!

45
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:02,790
<i>These valleys of milky mist</i>

46
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:04,660
<i>Centuries flow through here</i>

47
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:07,000
<i>These valleys of milky mist</i>

00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:23,910
<i>The earth keeps turning</i>

52

<i>Revolves around you eternally,
O Mirzya</i>

54
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,870
- What did you forget?
- Your favourite

55
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,750
- Monish?
- Yes, sir

56
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:25,580
Did you drop from the skies?

57
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:29,120
You weren't here a minute ago

58
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:32,750
I went back for my homework

59
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,910
Oh good. So you did your homework

60
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:38,200
Yes, sir

61
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:39,080
Show me

62
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:44,620
Hurry!

63
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:58,870
Bravo!

64
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,790
Your handwriting is improving
by the day

65
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:05,370
I practise every evening, sir

66
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:10,620
Suchitra

67
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:14,000
Show me your homework

68
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:18,500
Hurry!

69
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:25,870
You can go

70
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:38,750
Sir, I didn't do my homework

71
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,120
You didn't?

72
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,870
You know the punishment?

73
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:50,500
Don't you?

74
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:52,580
Yes, sir

75
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:15,750
- Sorry, Soochi
- Don't cry, Monish

76
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:21,500
Tell your Papa. He's a police officer.
He'll throw him into jail

77
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,620
He'll get him beaten up

78
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,750
Soochi, just tell your father

79
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,450
He won't spare the teacher

80
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:34,870
He'll shoot him

81
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:00,000
Tell your Father.
Show him your palm

82
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:05,870
You'll get into trouble.
The teacher will tell him that you cheated

83
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:17,870
How was school?

84
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:20,120
Fine

85
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:24,000
Tea, sir

86
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,950
- Any homework?
- Yes, Papa

87
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:46,450
How are you Monish ?

88
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:44,750
If you look up at the sky, how can I
braid your hair down here?

89
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:02,500
Monish!

90
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,500
He's left for school

91
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:16,830
Said the teacher called him
in early

92
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:19,870
Ok

93
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,250
How are you?

94
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:56,750
It happens.

95
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,200
In love it happens.

96
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:04,830
One suffers the hurt...

97
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:07,330
...while the other bleeds.

98
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:14,000
<i>It happens</i>

99
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:20,700
<i>It happens</i>

100
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,250
<i>One suffers the hurt...</i>

101
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:32,120
<i>...while the other bleeds</i>

102
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,580
<i>In love it happens</i>

103
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,370
<i>In love it happens</i>

104
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,500
<i>In passion</i>

105
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:57,450
<i>It happens</i>

106
00:19:57,790 --> 00:20:00,000
<i>The sun singes the sky</i>

107
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,620
<i>And the earth is scarred</i>

108
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:07,750
<i>In love it happens</i>

109
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:47,000
<i>The verdict of Time
did not favour love</i>

110
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:55,500
<i>Bound in chains the lover
is led</i> away

111
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:58,620
<i>In love</i>

112
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:22,410
<i>Everything was tried</i>

113
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:28,370
<i>Every oil lamp filled</i>

114
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:37,500
<i>Everything was tried</i>

115
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:41,500
<i>Every oil lamp filled</i>

116
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:45,540
<i>Unless a spark strikes...</i>

117
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:49,290
<i>...no lamp can burn</i>

118
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:51,750
<i>The colour of henna comes alive</i>

119
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,750
<i>Only when fully crushed</i>

120
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:58,750
<i>The colour of henna comes alive</i>

121
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:00,500
<i>Only when fully crushed</i>

122
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:02,790
<i>It happens</i>

123
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:05,120
<i>It often happens in love</i>

124
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:12,500
<i>In love</i>

125
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:16,620
<i>One suffers the hurt
while the other bleeds</i>

126
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:29,750
<i>Sometimes it so happens...</i>

127
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:35,410
<i>...friends are separated,
but unspoken memories...</i>

128
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:39,000
<i>...whisper silently as
the lovers part</i>

129
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,500
<i>Lakes dry up,
but the cracks written into the soil remain</i>

130
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:46,250
<i>Those unspoken memories</i>

131
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:55,620
<i>Forever baked by the hot sun</i>

132
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:58,500
<i>Sometimes it so happens</i>

133
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,500
<i>The sun singes the sky</i>

134
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:07,120
<i>And the earth is scarred</i>

135
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:10,750
<i>It happens in love</i>

136
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:23,580
<i>It happens</i>

137
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:26,000
<i>In love it happens</i>

138
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:27,870
<i>In passion</i>

139
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:31,750
<i>It happens</i>

140
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,120
<i>In love it happens</i>

141
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:35,120
<i>In passion</i>

142
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:38,620
<i>It happens</i>

143
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:41,750
<i>It happens</i>

144
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,620
<i>It happens</i>

145
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,080
<i>It happens</i>

146
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:03,500
O <i>Mirzya</i>

147
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:39,450
Salaam, Adil Mirza

148
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,620
Come here

149
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:03,450
Hit it

150
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,330
Well done!

151
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:08,870
Salaam, Abba

152
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:11,750
Bless you, my son

153
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,870
Haven't seen you around

154
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:34,080
Forgotten how to nail a horseshoe?

155
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:37,370
I learned it from you,
the hard way

156
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:47,000
- Where's Rashid?
- He has wings under his feet now

157
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:49,290
Here he comes

158
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:50,950
What's his name?

159
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,500
The White One

160
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,000
Obviously, can't be the Black One!

161
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:57,250
Sharp tongue!

162
00:25:57,540 --> 00:26:00,580
- Munna,done?
- Be patient

163
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:03,910
He has four legs,
not two like you

164
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:07,250
I meant it's time for your prayers,
Munna

165
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:12,200
Brat!

166
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:15,370
Addresses me as if I were
a kid like him

167
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:17,620
But your name means "kid"

168
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,750
He's his grandpa!

169
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:27,450
- No need
- Take it

170
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:33,910
One day I'll steal your money

171
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:35,080
And ?

172
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:38,080
I'll buy a motorcycle like yours

173
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:41,500
He's older than you.
Talk with respect

174
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:45,040
But you don't. Neither does Munna

175
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,540
- Let's go
- Take him

176
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:48,750
Put your cap on

177
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:53,040
Zeenat, don't IetAdil leave
without eating

178
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,000
Yes father

179
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:13,080
Here he is. Nothing has
changed, Maharaj

180
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:16,500
Your son lives the life that you did

181
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:33,500
Karan's luxury hotels are no less
splendid...

182
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:35,750
...than palaces

183
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:39,580
Modern day kings are building
economic empires

184
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:54,870
The Commissioner is here
with a warrant

185
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:05,000
Get ready for a life sentence

186
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,450
Sir, I plead guilty

187
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:25,870
- When does Suchitra arrive?
- I should ask you that

188
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:30,080
She arrives on Saturday

189
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:45,870
What are you doing?

190
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,330
Drinking molten ice on the rocks

191
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:52,750
because you are the one
who always makes my drink

192
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:55,000
You're not here...
what do I do?

193
00:29:55,910 --> 00:30:01,370
Liar! You must be drinking
all the more in my absence.

194
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:06,120
Only to drown my sorrows...

195
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:13,870
What are you sad about now?
I'm not there!

196
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:17,330
Exactly

197
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:22,700
Come back

198
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:24,620
Very soon

199
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,750
What was that?

200
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:31,830
That was lightning striking
to the news of your arrival.

201
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:34,500
Have the rain clouds come?

202
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:40,120
Yeah. Come soon

203
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:44,450
The rains will come with you

204
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:59,950
- How are you dear child?
- I'm well

205
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:02,620
- How are you, my child?
- I'm fine

206
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,160
How are you?

207
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:26,160
- I was fine till now...
- But now that I'm here...?

208
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,500
Did I say a word?

209
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:54,040
- Go. I'll bring your belongings
- May I take what belongs to you?

210
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:58,000
She's all yours. I have no hold
over her anymore

211
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,080
We'll follow you

212
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,950
Our child is back home

213
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:31,700
Not much fun traveling alone
on a long flight

214
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:34,580
I could've flown you here

215
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,120
You mean on horseback?

216
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:40,620
That, too. Very soon

217
00:34:14,910 --> 00:34:16,330
<i>Adm us, Ad“</i>

218
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:09,370
<i>Long ears, slender legs,
silky black tail</i>

219
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:16,700
<i>Angels fear the Black Horse</i>

220
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:23,250
<i>And even God fears</i> Mirza

221
00:38:58,750 --> 00:38:59,870
Princess-to-be

222
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:03,370
Papa! Why such an expensive gifts?

223
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:09,750
It will all be yours some day

224
00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:12,000
What do you say, Mr Rathore?

225
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
You spoil her, Maharaj

226
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:20,870
Winning a Prince didn't spoil her,
so mere jewels cannot

227
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:25,750
Let's go

228
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,250
Give me that

229
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:40,080
My mother wore them for
polo matches

230
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:44,500
Your father already treats me
as your bride

231
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:50,700
In fact, he wants you to move
into our guest palace right away

232
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,620
Oh really?

233
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:07,080
Will you teach me how to ride?

234
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:10,370
You're a Princess. Riding is a must

235
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:17,000
My beloved is away

236
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:23,120
Whenever she remembers me

237
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:29,700
I get Hiccups.

238
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,870
- Adil, is all ok?
- Yes, sir

239
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:51,200
where did you go to school?

240
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:53,120
School?

241
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:55,950
I didn't go to school, sir

242
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,830
But you speak English well

243
00:41:58,790 --> 00:42:02,080
I learned a bit in the stables

244
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:04,620
From the horses?

245
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:09,120
Ma'am wants to learn English.

246
00:42:09,290 --> 00:42:11,580
I mean... learn horse riding

247
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,370
Help her practice

248
00:42:16,290 --> 00:42:17,250
Go

249
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,250
Let the horses teach you English

250
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:07,500
First thing, don't get nervous

251
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:10,250
If you are...

252
00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:13,750
...the horse can feel it

253
00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:17,330
How does it know?

254
00:43:19,410 --> 00:43:21,750
Princess, it understands Hindi
and English

255
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:24,870
Like you? Without attending school?

256
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:34,120
<i>What stirred me in my sleep?</i>

257
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:37,120
<i>Kept me wide-eyed all night</i>

258
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:43,000
<i>The lover, the heart...</i>

259
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,620
<i>...the lamp keep me awake</i>

260
00:43:47,410 --> 00:43:51,750
<i>I hear a voice call</i>

261
00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:54,000
<i>I hear a voice call</i>

262
00:43:56,290 --> 00:43:58,370
<i>I hear a voice call</i>

263
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:00,620
<i>I hear a voice call</i>

264
00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:02,870
<i>I hear a voice call</i>

265
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:07,370
<i>No word came</i>

266
00:44:07,370 --> 00:44:09,200
<i>I sent a letter</i>

267
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:11,870
<i>In the rainy season</i>

268
00:44:11,870 --> 00:44:13,620
<i>My eyes are dry</i>

269
00:44:13,790 --> 00:44:16,250
<i>The riverbed is dry</i>

270
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:18,540
<i>The leaves are dry</i>

271
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:21,700
<i>Dryness fills within</i>

272
00:44:22,790 --> 00:44:27,120
<i>I hear a voice call</i>

273
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:29,750
<i>I hear a voice call</i>

274
00:44:31,370 --> 00:44:36,160
<i>The sun is high over the roof</i>

275
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:39,750
<i>Burning all the shade</i>

276
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:44,830
<i>How shall I cross the courtyard?</i>

277
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:49,000
<i>My feet will burn</i>

278
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,540
<i>The riverbed is dry</i>

279
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:53,790
<i>The leaves are dry</i>

280
00:44:53,790 --> 00:44:57,870
<i>Dryness fills within</i>

281
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:18,040
O <i>my lovely</i>

282
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:20,540
<i>The evening falls</i>

283
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:22,370
<i>The moon rises</i>

284
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:25,950
<i>Don't make me cry again</i>

285
00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:30,950
O <i>my lovely</i>

286
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:35,750
<i>Swear on me</i>

287
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:39,750
<i>Don't come into my memories</i>

288
00:45:39,910 --> 00:45:44,620
<i>The lover, the heart...</i>

289
00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:48,200
<i>...the lamp keep me awake</i>

290
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:51,250
<i>The riverbed is dry</i>

291
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:53,500
<i>The leaves are dry</i>

292
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:56,830
<i>Dryness fills within</i>

293
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:00,500
O <i>my lovely</i>

294
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:04,370
O <i>my lovely</i>

295
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:08,500
<i>I remain thirsty</i>

296
00:46:08,910 --> 00:46:10,750
<i>The clouds do not heed me</i>

297
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,120
<i>I remain thirsty</i>

298
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:13,870
<i>The clouds do not heed me</i>

299
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:17,660
<i>I remain thirsty</i>

300
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:20,000
<i>The clouds do not heed me</i>

301
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
<i>Though the rain falls</i>

302
00:46:24,410 --> 00:46:26,250
<i>I remain thirsty</i>

303
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:28,500
<i>The clouds do not heed me</i>

304
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:35,370
Have you been to Jodhpur?

305
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:36,700
No

306
00:46:37,910 --> 00:46:40,080
I went to school there

307
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:42,330
I had a best friend

308
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:45,330
He would carry my school bag
and walk with me

309
00:46:46,290 --> 00:46:49,250
- Boys and girls studied together?
- Yes

310
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:53,830
We would bunk class...

311
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:57,500
...and cycle all the way up to
the Fort

312
00:46:58,660 --> 00:47:01,500
Then freewheel down

313
00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:05,500
The cycle flew down the slopes
like the wind

314
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:07,250
With you on it?

315
00:47:07,910 --> 00:47:12,040
I would sit in front and let go of
the handlebars

316
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:14,620
It was terrifying and exciting

317
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:19,250
Speed is exhilarating, Princess

318
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:24,950
I am no Princess

319
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:34,370
Will you teach me how to ride
a motorcycle?

320
00:47:35,410 --> 00:47:36,830
No

321
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:39,450
The Prince will kill me

322
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:46,370
I've seen how fast you drive a car

323
00:47:46,910 --> 00:47:49,870
But nothing beats a bike ride

324
00:47:51,370 --> 00:47:54,200
I want to fly as I did with Monish

325
00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:02,250
Monish, my best friend

326
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,250
I don't know where he has vanished

327
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:18,620
<i>The dry riverbed,
the dry leaves</i>

328
00:48:18,790 --> 00:48:22,450
<i>Dryness fills within</i>

329
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:30,330
<i>I hear a voice call</i>

330
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,080
<i>I hear a voice call</i>

331
00:48:36,410 --> 00:48:40,620
<i>I hear a voice call</i>

332
00:48:40,870 --> 00:48:44,870
<i>Kept me wide-eyed all night</i>

333
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:53,000
<i>Dryness fills within</i>

334
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:55,950
Monish was always late for school

335
00:48:56,870 --> 00:48:59,370
Sometimes we missed the
bus

336
00:48:59,790 --> 00:49:01,750
He was so lazy

337
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,830
He never did his homework

338
00:49:16,910 --> 00:49:21,330
But he took great care of me

339
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:31,250
He brought me my favourite sweet

340
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:33,750
Princess!

341
00:49:34,290 --> 00:49:36,620
Why do you keep talking
to me about him?

342
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:39,500
Go look for him at the
Gowardhan Public School

343
00:49:58,410 --> 00:49:59,870
Monish?

344
00:50:08,250 --> 00:50:10,080
Where did you vanish?

345
00:50:17,290 --> 00:50:19,450
I'm not a princess

346
00:50:21,870 --> 00:50:23,500
I'm Suchitra

347
00:50:25,870 --> 00:50:28,370
You used to call me Soochi

348
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:38,450
Remember I had this tattoo done

349
00:50:39,410 --> 00:50:41,200
Look!

350
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:44,500
You tattooed my name on your back

351
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:51,370
Go tell your father that you've found
the escaped murderer

352
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:54,500
Let him arrest me

353
00:51:02,540 --> 00:51:04,370
Tell him yourself

354
00:51:06,410 --> 00:51:07,870
You liar

355
00:51:13,750 --> 00:51:16,700
You've led me on for days

356
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:21,950
I kept talking about our past...

357
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:24,580
...and you said nothing

358
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:27,120
You cheat

359
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:47,500
<i>It tickles</i>

360
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:53,250
<i>It tickles</i>

361
00:52:28,790 --> 00:52:30,160
<i>Monish!</i>

362
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:31,500
<i>Coming!</i>

363
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:34,500
<i>- Hurry up!
- I'm coming</i>

364
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:39,370
<i>You're always getting me late</i>

365
00:52:39,790 --> 00:52:43,160
<i>- What were you doing?
- Target practice</i>

366
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:44,500
<i>Your bag</i>

367
00:52:47,410 --> 00:52:49,370
<i>Your favourite sweet</i>

368
00:53:07,910 --> 00:53:09,450
I love you

369
00:53:54,870 --> 00:53:56,330
I can't do it, Adil

370
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:01,500
I can't

371
00:55:14,410 --> 00:55:16,370
Welcome to the family

372
00:55:19,790 --> 00:55:21,500
For you

373
00:55:53,660 --> 00:55:58,370
<i>Love heeds no command</i>

374
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:04,830
<i>Togetherness is not closeness</i>

375
00:56:05,910 --> 00:56:12,750
<i>Talking is so easy</i>

376
00:56:13,540 --> 00:56:17,870
<i>Talking is so easy</i>

377
00:56:18,410 --> 00:56:23,370
<i>Keeping an oath so difficult</i>

378
00:59:31,410 --> 00:59:33,250
What have you done, Princess?

379
00:59:36,750 --> 00:59:39,620
I told you I'm not a Princess

380
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,160
I'm Soochi

381
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:44,870
I can't call you that

382
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:48,950
It is not right...

383
00:59:50,540 --> 00:59:52,870
...for you to come here
at this late hour

384
00:59:54,540 --> 00:59:56,250
Who did you come to see

385
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:59,620
- Did no one ask?
- No

386
01:00:00,750 --> 01:00:03,950
I would've said I came to see Monish

387
01:00:07,790 --> 01:00:09,700
I'm unworthy of you

388
01:00:12,790 --> 01:00:14,000
Prince Karan...

389
01:00:16,290 --> 01:00:17,580
He loves you

390
01:00:22,290 --> 01:00:23,700
And you?

391
01:00:28,410 --> 01:00:30,250
Don't you love me?

392
01:00:37,370 --> 01:00:38,500
No

393
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:52,750
What is it?

394
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:46,120
She came wearing the silk night
on her delicate shoulders

395
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:53,080
He swayed with the moon
crowned on his head

396
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:59,620
<i>At what place will Time
stop them?</i>

397
01:02:01,290 --> 01:02:06,000
<i>A Princess she was</i>

398
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:11,700
<i>A Prince he was not</i>

399
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:51,620
<i>The lovelorn bird flew into the sky</i>

400
01:03:05,410 --> 01:03:07,500
<i>The lovelorn bird flew high...</i>

401
01:03:07,660 --> 01:03:10,450
<i>...aiming to catch the moon</i>

402
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:20,370
<i>When love skims the knife's edge,
it severs both wings</i>

403
01:03:24,660 --> 01:03:26,870
<i>The lovelorn bird flew high...</i>

404
01:03:26,870 --> 01:03:28,660
<i>...aiming to catch the moon</i>

405
01:03:28,660 --> 01:03:32,750
<i>When love skims the knife's edge,
it severs both wings</i>

406
01:03:32,750 --> 01:03:36,370
<i>The flame destroys the moth</i>

407
01:03:36,540 --> 01:03:38,870
<i>And the wick consumes itself</i>

408
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:44,250
<i>Lovers burn in an eternal embrace</i>

409
01:03:44,410 --> 01:03:47,870
<i>Lovers burn in an eternal embrace</i>

410
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:51,450
<i>Lovers burn in an eternal embrace</i>

411
01:03:51,750 --> 01:03:54,750
<i>Lovers burn in an eternal embrace</i>

412
01:03:55,370 --> 01:03:59,000
<i>Lovers burn in an eternal embrace</i>

413
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:16,870
<i>You find everything you seek
in the House of Love</i>

414
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:24,200
<i>Even God, the unseen</i>

415
01:04:28,290 --> 01:04:32,250
<i>Everyone finds what they seek</i>

416
01:04:32,410 --> 01:04:37,620
<i>But do lovers ever get it all?</i>

417
01:04:37,790 --> 01:04:41,370
<i>But do lovers ever get it all?</i>

418
01:04:41,660 --> 01:04:44,000
<i>A Princess she was</i>

419
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:48,370
<i>A Prince he was not</i>

420
01:04:49,290 --> 01:04:51,750
<i>Love visited the blacksmiths' alley</i>

421
01:04:51,750 --> 01:04:56,370
<i>But love was no blacksmith</i>

422
01:04:57,290 --> 01:05:03,120
<i>The flame destroys the moth.
And the wick consumes itself</i>

423
01:05:08,750 --> 01:05:15,700
<i>Lovers burn in an eternal embrace</i>

424
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:19,700
<i>Lovers burn in an eternal embrace</i>

425
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:23,500
<i>Lovers burn in an eternal embrace</i>

426
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:54,620
He's yours now

427
01:08:33,410 --> 01:08:34,870
Where were you all these days?

428
01:08:36,290 --> 01:08:37,500
This is Zeenat

429
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,000
Salaam

430
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:47,620
No one knows me like she does

431
01:08:49,910 --> 01:08:51,250
She knows my soul

432
01:08:56,790 --> 01:08:58,750
When I escaped prison...

433
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:03,200
...I ran for five whole clays
and nights

434
01:09:04,910 --> 01:09:07,580
I collapsed here in the
blacksmiths' alley

435
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:10,870
When I opened my eyes again...

436
01:09:12,370 --> 01:09:13,870
...I saw Zeenat's face

437
01:09:14,620 --> 01:09:16,870
And the red glow
of the furnaces

438
01:09:18,660 --> 01:09:23,250
- Who is she?
- The Princess

439
01:09:23,410 --> 01:09:25,500
Does the White One belong to you?

440
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:28,870
- He belongs to Prince Karan
- Who is he?

441
01:09:32,160 --> 01:09:34,080
The man I am to marry

442
01:09:38,790 --> 01:09:40,580
Why not marry Adil Mirza?

443
01:09:43,540 --> 01:09:45,160
Behave yourself

444
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:49,000
- Or you'll shut me up?
- That's right

445
01:09:51,410 --> 01:09:53,500
They talk in riddles here

446
01:09:58,790 --> 01:10:00,120
I'll be right back

447
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:35,250
My late husband's marriage gift.
I gift them to you now

448
01:10:42,620 --> 01:10:44,500
You're in love with Adil

449
01:10:50,370 --> 01:10:54,000
We are links in a long chain

450
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:56,120
lam linked to Adil

451
01:10:56,290 --> 01:10:57,870
<i>Ad“ to you</i>

452
01:10:58,040 --> 01:11:00,250
And you to Prince Karan

453
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:11,160
No please. I can't take your bracelet

454
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:13,870
- Don't break the pair
- It's fine

455
01:11:13,870 --> 01:11:16,290
I'll give the other one to Monish

456
01:11:16,290 --> 01:11:17,500
Monish?

457
01:11:20,750 --> 01:11:22,120
Let's go

458
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,370
Monish

459
01:14:06,660 --> 01:14:10,250
<i>Of another Time he came</i>

460
01:14:10,790 --> 01:14:14,200
<i>To another Time he went</i>

461
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:19,000
<i>Like passion, raising dust</i>

462
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:21,250
<i>On earth, across the universe</i>

463
01:14:21,410 --> 01:14:25,250
<i>Where? Where shall I seek you?</i>

464
01:14:25,410 --> 01:14:27,700
<i>Mirzya</i>

465
01:14:28,790 --> 01:14:31,250
<i>Mirzya</i>

466
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,160
<i>The earth keeps turning</i>

467
01:14:35,160 --> 01:14:37,120
<i>Comes from nowhere,
goes nowhere</i>

468
01:14:37,290 --> 01:14:41,000
<i>Revolves around you eternally,
O Mirzya</i>

469
01:15:16,750 --> 01:15:17,830
It's okay.

470
01:15:18,370 --> 01:15:19,830
Sir!

471
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,080
<i>Yes Ad“?</i>

472
01:15:22,620 --> 01:15:23,620
How are you?

473
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:27,250
Sir, I wanted to remind you
about the safari tonight

474
01:15:27,660 --> 01:15:29,910
There's a big desert fair.
Tourists might want a ride

475
01:15:29,910 --> 01:15:31,500
I know

476
01:15:31,790 --> 01:15:34,000
I've already promised Soochi

477
01:15:34,540 --> 01:15:35,870
It's a fullmoon tonight

478
01:15:36,290 --> 01:15:38,500
The perfect time for a safari

479
01:15:39,250 --> 01:15:42,120
- Should I take the White One, sir?
- Sure

480
01:15:42,410 --> 01:15:44,250
Why are your hands blackened?

481
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:51,250
My motorbike broke down

482
01:15:52,290 --> 01:15:55,500
I asked you to teach me how to ride
a motorbike

483
01:15:57,040 --> 01:15:58,000
No, madam

484
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:17,750
Suchitra

485
01:16:23,750 --> 01:16:25,620
I didn't like what you just did.

486
01:16:28,910 --> 01:16:30,000
It was uncalled for

487
01:16:44,290 --> 01:16:45,830
You're now the princess!

488
01:16:55,250 --> 01:17:01,000
<i>There was a river holding
onto two shores</i>

489
01:17:04,750 --> 01:17:08,870
<i>Unable to let go of either shore</i>

490
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:14,370
<i>There was a river</i>

491
01:17:16,370 --> 01:17:19,370
<i>Breaking from one shore,
a terrible flood</i>

492
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:23,290
<i>Breaking from one shore,
a terrible flood</i>

493
01:17:23,290 --> 01:17:27,500
<i>Turning to the other,
would drown the earth</i>

494
01:17:27,500 --> 01:17:30,120
<i>There was a river</i>

495
01:17:30,410 --> 01:17:34,450
<i>There was a river holding
onto two shores</i>

496
01:17:34,750 --> 01:17:37,250
<i>There was a river</i>

497
01:18:25,910 --> 01:18:27,620
Monish

498
01:18:34,410 --> 01:18:35,750
Monish

499
01:18:42,160 --> 01:18:43,370
Soochi, run!

500
01:19:04,870 --> 01:19:06,000
Monish

501
01:19:52,910 --> 01:19:57,120
<i>The heart is a cruel ruler</i>

502
01:19:57,500 --> 01:20:01,500
<i>That keeps her in shackles</i>

503
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:03,830
<i>There was a river</i>

504
01:20:06,500 --> 01:20:08,620
<i>The heart is a cruel ruler</i>

505
01:20:08,790 --> 01:20:10,620
<i>That keeps her in shackles</i>

506
01:20:10,620 --> 01:20:12,370
<i>There was a river</i>

507
01:20:12,370 --> 01:20:15,870
<i>That keeps her in shackles</i>

508
01:20:15,870 --> 01:20:20,160
<i>There was a river holding
onto two shores</i>

509
01:20:20,160 --> 01:20:22,290
<i>There was a river</i>

510
01:20:22,290 --> 01:20:26,750
<i>There was a river holding
onto two shores</i>

511
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:30,620
<i>There was a river</i>

512
01:20:52,410 --> 01:20:53,950
Don't worry

513
01:20:55,750 --> 01:20:57,750
- Is it a serious fracture?
- No

514
01:20:58,120 --> 01:21:00,870
You mean he can go home
spflnfing?

515
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:02,330
Absolutely

516
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:06,200
Hey, big DOV

517
01:21:07,620 --> 01:21:09,450
Out chasing cats?

518
01:21:10,750 --> 01:21:12,580
Couldn't you wait a bit?

519
01:21:13,250 --> 01:21:16,450
You're marrying soon enough.
Right, Commissioner?

520
01:21:30,120 --> 01:21:33,580
You risked your life and saved
the Princess

521
01:21:34,910 --> 01:21:36,950
I'd die many times for her

522
01:21:39,250 --> 01:21:41,080
You were very brave

523
01:21:45,250 --> 01:21:46,200
Go, child

524
01:21:46,790 --> 01:21:48,580
You've been up all night

525
01:21:48,910 --> 01:21:50,330
My car's outside

526
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:52,330
Soochi

527
01:21:58,290 --> 01:21:59,870
Go and rest

528
01:22:04,750 --> 01:22:06,580
God bless you, my child

529
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,620
See her to the car

530
01:22:12,660 --> 01:22:15,250
The lioness is wounded.
She's now more dangerous

531
01:22:15,250 --> 01:22:18,450
You'll have to kill that cat, my son

532
01:22:24,040 --> 01:22:25,580
The wedding is near

533
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:31,370
The Maharajah has decided

534
01:22:42,620 --> 01:22:44,250
But he didn't say when

535
01:23:09,660 --> 01:23:11,950
Nor did he say to whom

536
01:23:29,500 --> 01:23:33,250
Someone called Adil Mirza is here
to see you

537
01:23:37,660 --> 01:23:39,080
Come

538
01:23:42,870 --> 01:23:44,330
How are you?

539
01:23:47,290 --> 01:23:49,250
Come and sit down

540
01:23:52,250 --> 01:23:53,580
What brings you here?

541
01:23:58,660 --> 01:24:00,620
Sir, I need to ask you something

542
01:24:00,790 --> 01:24:02,250
Go ahead

543
01:24:10,290 --> 01:24:12,120
Sir, if a young boy...

544
01:24:15,500 --> 01:24:18,250
...a mere child were to commit
a crime...

545
01:24:21,290 --> 01:24:23,370
...for how long would he
be considered a criminal?

546
01:24:26,160 --> 01:24:30,250
The law can be harsh
but compassionate too

547
01:24:31,250 --> 01:24:32,620
What happened?

548
01:24:36,250 --> 01:24:37,870
You can tell me, son

549
01:24:40,660 --> 01:24:43,250
Remember when you
were in Jodhpur...

550
01:24:46,620 --> 01:24:49,000
A nine year-old boy stole your gun

551
01:24:53,620 --> 01:24:56,250
He killed a schoolteacher
with that gun

552
01:24:59,540 --> 01:25:01,200
Shot him dead

553
01:25:19,290 --> 01:25:21,370
He was So0chi's classmate

554
01:25:26,040 --> 01:25:28,000
He loved Soochi

555
01:25:31,160 --> 01:25:32,500
Still does

556
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,250
How did you change your name ?

557
01:25:38,910 --> 01:25:40,750
We want to marry...

558
01:25:43,620 --> 01:25:44,750
Get out!

559
01:25:46,410 --> 01:25:47,370
Now

560
01:26:08,540 --> 01:26:10,370
So he changed his name?

561
01:26:12,040 --> 01:26:14,370
No one can escape the law, sir

562
01:26:16,910 --> 01:26:20,950
Royal houses do not give
a damn about the law

563
01:26:22,500 --> 01:26:25,700
Put out this fire before
it consumes us

564
01:28:41,910 --> 01:28:43,750
<i>His real name is Monish</i>

565
01:28:52,620 --> 01:28:54,950
- <i>Teach me how to ride</i> a <i>bike?</i>
- <i>Soochi!!</i>

566
01:29:09,250 --> 01:29:10,830
<i>Why are your hands blackened?</i>

567
01:29:11,040 --> 01:29:12,250
<i>Teach me to ride a bike?</i>

568
01:29:12,910 --> 01:29:14,500
<i>No one can escape the law</i>

569
01:29:14,750 --> 01:29:16,370
<i>His real name is Monish</i>

570
01:29:16,370 --> 01:29:17,870
<i>Royal houses do not give a damn
about the law</i>

571
01:29:18,040 --> 01:29:18,750
<i>How did he change his name?</i>

572
01:29:18,910 --> 01:29:20,080
<i>Teach me to ride a bike?</i>

573
01:33:20,290 --> 01:33:21,250
Soochi

574
01:33:23,500 --> 01:33:26,250
The sound of your footsteps

575
01:33:27,160 --> 01:33:29,870
I can hear them

576
01:33:30,120 --> 01:33:32,620
From where do they come?

577
01:33:35,620 --> 01:33:37,000
Are they returning?

578
01:33:39,250 --> 01:33:40,620
Or departing?

579
01:33:46,160 --> 01:33:47,700
Have you come back?

580
01:33:50,250 --> 01:33:51,750
Or are you leaving?

581
01:34:01,120 --> 01:34:07,000
The ties of the heart are not
cut by a saw

582
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,080
They are cut...

583
01:34:17,910 --> 01:34:19,870
...by actions such as yours

584
01:34:34,040 --> 01:34:37,620
You have destroyed me Soochi

585
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:28,830
O <i>beloved</i>

586
01:35:33,790 --> 01:35:38,620
O <i>beloved</i>

587
01:35:40,750 --> 01:35:44,870
O <i>beloved</i>

588
01:35:51,410 --> 01:35:53,870
<i>The bride is leaving</i>

589
01:35:54,040 --> 01:35:56,370
<i>The lover's treasure departs</i>

590
01:35:56,790 --> 01:35:59,200
<i>The bride is leaving</i>

591
01:35:59,410 --> 01:36:02,870
<i>The lover's treasure departs</i>

592
01:36:05,160 --> 01:36:09,250
<i>O father, we played in every season</i>

593
01:36:10,500 --> 01:36:13,000
<i>Swinging on swings...</i>

594
01:36:13,160 --> 01:36:15,000
<i>...in the falling rain</i>

595
01:36:16,250 --> 01:36:19,000
<i>You kept awake...</i>

596
01:36:19,160 --> 01:36:24,000
<i>...and whispered lullabies
as I slept</i>

597
01:36:25,790 --> 01:36:28,250
<i>As I step beyond the threshold</i>

598
01:36:31,410 --> 01:36:33,870
<i>As I step beyond the threshold</i>

599
01:36:34,040 --> 01:36:38,250
<i>My dues are now settled, O father</i>

600
01:36:39,540 --> 01:36:43,370
<i>My dues are now settled, O father</i>

601
01:36:43,910 --> 01:36:48,500
<i>A box of bridal vermillion,
poison hidden within</i>

602
01:36:48,910 --> 01:36:53,120
<i>Poison for the bride,
if the lover does not arrive</i>

603
01:36:56,290 --> 01:36:58,370
O <i>beloved</i>

604
01:36:59,660 --> 01:37:05,580
O <i>beloved</i>

605
01:37:08,040 --> 01:37:11,250
O <i>beloved</i>

606
01:38:13,620 --> 01:38:17,160
<i>O Iovelorn bird!</i>

607
01:38:17,160 --> 01:38:21,500
<i>Give me news of my beloved</i>

608
01:38:21,500 --> 01:38:25,000
<i>O Iovelorn bird!</i>

609
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:28,620
<i>Give me news of my beloved</i>

610
01:38:32,290 --> 01:38:40,950
<i>May she not die of thirst</i>

611
01:38:41,370 --> 01:38:44,500
<i>Bring a beakful of water</i>

612
01:38:44,500 --> 01:38:48,950
<i>O Iovelorn bird!</i>

613
01:39:40,160 --> 01:39:42,040
Soochi, come out!

614
01:39:42,040 --> 01:39:44,370
Look, she is sitting still

615
01:39:45,410 --> 01:39:47,370
Please bring the bride

616
01:41:03,910 --> 01:41:05,500
Move

617
01:41:06,910 --> 01:41:09,250
Soochi, open up!

618
01:41:12,540 --> 01:41:13,500
S0ochH

619
01:41:23,910 --> 01:41:29,370
<i>It happens.
Often it happens in love</i>

620
01:41:30,290 --> 01:41:32,450
<i>Often it happens in love</i>

621
01:41:34,290 --> 01:41:39,000
<i>One suffers the hurt
while the other bleeds</i>

622
01:42:00,290 --> 01:42:02,950
Any news?

623
01:42:04,040 --> 01:42:06,120
Sir, their photographs have been
circulated

624
01:42:08,040 --> 01:42:10,370
We must be missing something

625
01:42:15,120 --> 01:42:16,830
Did you help them elope?

626
01:42:19,790 --> 01:42:21,580
Where's the commissioner's daughter?

627
01:42:46,040 --> 01:42:47,250
Come, son

628
01:42:48,500 --> 01:42:49,580
It's all over

629
01:42:50,120 --> 01:42:51,700
Nothing is over

630
01:43:09,040 --> 01:43:10,370
Where will we go?

631
01:43:12,410 --> 01:43:14,330
Beyond the desert

632
01:43:15,540 --> 01:43:17,000
Across the border

633
01:43:18,250 --> 01:43:21,080
We'll see once we get there

634
01:44:20,790 --> 01:44:21,580
You okay?

635
01:44:50,410 --> 01:44:51,580
Your shoe

636
01:45:04,370 --> 01:45:12,200
<i>Nothing lies beyond the sky</i>

637
01:45:16,160 --> 01:45:19,580
<i>There's only you...</i>

638
01:45:20,370 --> 01:45:24,080
<i>...and me</i>

639
01:45:45,160 --> 01:45:49,080
<i>Our love has three witnesses</i>

640
01:45:49,750 --> 01:45:53,620
<i>There's God, you...</i>

641
01:45:54,250 --> 01:45:56,000
<i>...and me</i>

642
01:45:58,660 --> 01:46:03,370
<i>Why does the earth echo today?</i>

643
01:46:07,910 --> 01:46:12,500
<i>The sky is lost in their story</i>

644
01:46:17,040 --> 01:46:20,750
<i>Our love has three witnesses</i>

645
01:46:21,660 --> 01:46:25,660
<i>There's God, you...</i>

646
01:46:25,660 --> 01:46:27,750
<i>...and me</i>

647
01:46:33,120 --> 01:46:37,250
<i>Let us open the sky and see</i>

648
01:46:37,660 --> 01:46:41,870
<i>Perhaps another sky we'll find</i>

649
01:46:42,500 --> 01:46:46,750
<i>Let us walk together</i>

650
01:46:51,500 --> 01:46:55,410
<i>Let my soul meet yours</i>

651
01:46:55,410 --> 01:46:56,250
Any perm?

652
01:46:56,410 --> 01:46:59,500
<i>Let love's fragrance soar</i>

653
01:46:59,500 --> 01:47:00,750
Only one bottle?

654
01:47:00,750 --> 01:47:06,700
<i>Let the dream stay a dream</i>

655
01:47:09,870 --> 01:47:13,250
<i>Our love has three witnesses</i>

656
01:47:14,540 --> 01:47:18,540
<i>There's God, you...</i>

657
01:47:18,540 --> 01:47:21,250
<i>...and me</i>

658
01:49:03,910 --> 01:49:05,250
Where?

659
01:49:53,660 --> 01:49:55,250
We're out of petrol

660
01:49:58,080 --> 01:49:59,620
What now?

661
01:53:21,660 --> 01:53:23,870
- Any news?
- Nothing, sir

662
01:53:24,040 --> 01:53:26,750
- How far is the border?
- 25 miles away

663
01:53:26,910 --> 01:53:29,870
We've alerted the border patrol

664
01:53:29,870 --> 01:53:32,580
We'll get them by sunset

665
01:53:33,540 --> 01:53:35,370
We have to

666
01:55:36,120 --> 01:55:42,080
<i>Do not wear the noose of love</i>

667
01:55:44,290 --> 01:55:50,870
<i>This rope is unending</i>

668
01:55:52,540 --> 01:56:02,250
<i>You will never get Sahiba</i>

669
01:56:03,790 --> 01:56:08,870
<i>You will never get Sahiba</i>

670
01:56:09,500 --> 01:56:21,620
<i>Do not be born again, O Mirzya</i>

671
01:56:44,410 --> 01:56:50,500
<i>The earth turned crimson</i>

672
01:56:52,290 --> 01:56:57,450
<i>The sky turned copper</i>

673
01:56:59,790 --> 01:57:04,830
<i>Blood gushed from his brow</i>

674
01:57:06,540 --> 01:57:10,870
<i>His senses fading away</i>

675
01:57:12,910 --> 01:57:15,620
- How much further?
- Not much

676
01:57:17,160 --> 01:57:20,620
It'll soon be dark. We'll leave
at dawn

677
01:57:38,540 --> 01:57:40,750
- How many bullets left?
- Six

678
01:57:42,250 --> 01:57:45,080
- Are they enough?
- How many will come for us?

679
01:57:46,790 --> 01:57:50,580
Who knows! Many, if the police
come too

680
01:57:52,660 --> 01:57:55,370
Maybe Karan will come

681
01:58:01,500 --> 01:58:02,620
The first bullet is for...

682
01:58:03,290 --> 01:58:04,450
...your Prince Karan

683
01:58:21,250 --> 01:58:22,620
The second?

684
01:58:24,540 --> 01:58:27,700
Maybe the Maharajah will come

685
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:30,450
And your father

686
01:58:32,370 --> 01:58:34,000
He'll be there for sure

687
01:58:35,660 --> 01:58:39,870
So, the second bullet is for
the Maharajah

688
01:58:42,870 --> 01:58:46,950
The third is for your father

689
01:59:13,620 --> 01:59:14,750
And?

690
01:59:15,540 --> 01:59:17,500
The fourth...for you

691
01:59:21,160 --> 01:59:22,620
The fifth...me

692
01:59:26,040 --> 01:59:28,000
And the last bullet?

693
01:59:28,790 --> 01:59:30,620
It could be for anyone

694
02:01:45,370 --> 02:01:47,870
Soochi, get the horse!

695
02:02:56,000 --> 02:03:02,120
<i>Do not wear the noose of love</i>

696
02:03:04,160 --> 02:03:11,120
<i>This rope is unending</i>

697
02:03:12,540 --> 02:03:17,500
<i>You will never get Sahiba</i>

698
02:03:18,120 --> 02:03:24,250
<i>Do not be born again, Mirzya</i>

699
02:03:44,290 --> 02:03:48,000
Soochi...

700
02:05:35,910 --> 02:05:39,450
<i>These valleys of milky mist</i>

701
02:05:40,160 --> 02:05:43,620
<i>Centuries flow through here</i>

702
02:05:45,160 --> 02:05:49,580
<i>Love never dies, O Mirzya</i>

703
02:05:51,250 --> 02:05:57,330
<i>Forever lives the beloved Sahiba</i>
