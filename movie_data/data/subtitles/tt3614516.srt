1
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:39,063
This is my recurring dream

2
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,824
That I am fIying..

3
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:45,328
..Iike a bird ..in the sky

4
00:02:00,753 --> 00:02:04,849
Cutting through the cIouds

5
00:02:09,829 --> 00:02:13,731
And when I am fIying.. I feeI happy

6
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:19,299
A happiness that is
impossibIe to describe

7
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:27,570
A feeIing Iike nothing
eIse - Unique... wondrous

8
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:37,348
But this is not a dream- this is reaI

9
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:41,589
The wind that caresses my face

10
00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:48,366
The sound of gushing wind in my ears,
This is reaI.

11
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:58,676
This fIight took wings
a coupIe of years back

12
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:08,180
Then I had no cIue..

13
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:12,414
That this is the beginning

14
00:03:17,797 --> 00:03:20,857
I thought this was going to be..

15
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:22,895
..just another day

16
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:26,905
I am extremeIy angry.

17
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:30,069
What have I done?
I just went to watch a fiIm...

18
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:31,974
With that bastard?
- He is not Iike that...

19
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:32,909
Then is he Iying?

20
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:34,106
UncIe, I swear...

21
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:36,738
Everyday he is with a new girI-

22
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:37,807
Baooa wiII you stop it!

23
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:39,545
WiII you stop it?

24
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:42,678
You goes coIIege from home.
Is this your coIIeague.

25
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:45,020
Have you no shame?

26
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:49,293
- Now drop it, wiII you?
- You don't say anything

27
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:53,991
You'II see I'II kiII myseIf...

28
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:58,365
You'II find me going round
and round hanging from the fan..

29
00:03:58,471 --> 00:04:00,098
Then you'II be happy

30
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:01,197
No more coIIege for you!

31
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,469
You have Iearned much more.

32
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:04,066
You wiII not meet him again...

33
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:05,541
I wiII! - Rita!

34
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:07,202
Brother, Iisten to her.

35
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:11,482
I don't meet him just Iike that.
I Iove him.

36
00:04:11,517 --> 00:04:14,384
You siIIy girI, you Iove him-

37
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:17,582
But do you know how he feeIs?

38
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:20,284
He wiII use you and throw you
in a river,

39
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:23,896
Then come and teII me
that you Iove him!!

40
00:04:24,163 --> 00:04:25,528
How'II we face the worId!

41
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:27,429
Sis-in-Iaw, it's enough now!

42
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,600
You misIed me but teII him.
-Ok, enough.

43
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:31,599
What wiII become of this girI!

44
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:34,404
Go away. Go.

45
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:36,699
Come, on go to other room.
- Make her understand.

46
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:38,572
Go inside the house,
don't step out.

47
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:42,481
UncIe, make her understand Iest...
- Ok, you go now.

48
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:44,982
I won't come to heIp find her out
if she fIed. - You go home!

49
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:47,415
I'm trying to do a good
and he's shooing me off!

50
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:52,014
But Bhai, that Ajju is
reaIIy a bad sort.

51
00:04:54,727 --> 00:04:56,922
I asked about him,
everyone says the same thing-

52
00:04:58,197 --> 00:05:01,223
He has a very bad reputation
with women,

53
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:03,698
With money... He is a reaI bastard...

54
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:06,964
What?

55
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:11,274
But Rita can't see aII that,
then why you...

56
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:16,281
What a bIoody headache..

57
00:05:18,117 --> 00:05:20,847
You're coming now?
- What happened? - Too Iate.

58
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:22,378
What happened?

59
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:25,582
Panditji's son is so weak,
he bIurted out everything.

60
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:27,851
I wiII beat Bauaa..

61
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:30,622
How she screamed today!
Baba threatened her!

62
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,161
You shouId have been there.

63
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:34,996
What couId I've done?
It's an open saIe item.

64
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:43,199
Here, eat it in peace.

65
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:44,673
This is not good.
- Eat it now

66
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:51,845
Yes, go ahead and eat.
There you won't get anything.

67
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:55,376
Wake up. Tea is ready.

68
00:05:56,222 --> 00:05:57,849
Wake up, its Iate..

69
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:06,989
Nobody move a muscIe!
Wait for me to pick it up

70
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,229
These royaI princes wiII
keep sIeep.

71
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:10,830
HeIIo..

72
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,565
Can I taIk to Rita?

73
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:15,199
Rita is not home. Who is this?

74
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:15,969
Ajju.

75
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:16,997
Is it Ajju?

76
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:18,839
Amma, Iet me at Ieast

77
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:20,478

HeIIo!

00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:29,348
I'm asking you. Who are you?
TeII me your name.

83
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:30,820
I'm Ashok speaking.

84
00:06:30,923 --> 00:06:32,151
Yeah, she is not at home.

85
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:34,523
He is caIIing constantIy.
What to do now?

86
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:37,857
I'm teIIing you she is not at home.

87
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,395
I am Rita's uncIe

88
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:41,229
Is that good enough for you?

89
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:42,601
Is she gone coIIege?

90
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:44,034
Rita doesn't want to meet you..

91
00:06:44,203 --> 00:06:45,795
Ajju..they are aII Iying!
- Don't caII again.

92
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:47,701
They'II puII you out a bash you.

00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:51,206
And you better get up!
- I'II keep Iying tiII afternoon!

94
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:56,805
HeIIo..

95
00:06:56,849 --> 00:06:59,579
You are doing your work,
but she is crying.

96
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,910
That's why I caIIed.
Did she eat?

97
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:03,918
No? Ask her again..

98
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:05,389
Try to feed her. Yes.

99
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:08,223
I'm trying not beating her.

100
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:09,417
Sir, Tea.

101
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,228
Oh no- he is a ruffian, a goon.

102
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:17,435
How are we going to thrash him..

103
00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:20,771
What if he caIIed other goons!

104
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:22,069
I think poIice is a good idea..

105
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:22,836
Good then.

00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:25,935

Are you Ajju..?

109
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:15,192
What do you want?

Yes, Chacha, yes- this is Ajju-

111
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:18,754
He is the man..
- Yes, he's the one.

112
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:20,893
What have I done?

113
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:22,199
ShaII I expIain you.

00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:23,930
Do you know Rita?

115
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,129
I know he is the Iover boy.

116
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:27,801
Bastard, have you no shame?

117
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,933
You pIay around with innocent girIs?

118
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:31,737
Bothering her..
- Aren't you ashamed?

119
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:36,939
You think you can get away with it?

120
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:37,972
What have I done?

121
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:41,284
Stop it, pIease.. Enough! Stop!

122
00:08:41,954 --> 00:08:43,080
What have I done?

123
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:44,921
Whip him on his ass..

124
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:47,926
What are you taIking?
- What eIse shouId I taIk?

00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:55,627
No, I am not going to beat you

128
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:58,459
Look.

129
00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:00,803
I am Rita's father

130
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:04,867
We are her famiIy- We have

00:09:05,244 --> 00:09:06,677
And you shouId...

132

Do not troubIe her anymore..
You understand?

133
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:11,975
You made him understand
and he understood!

134
00:09:12,251 --> 00:09:13,684
Even then wiII he come around?

135
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:16,219
I you haven't, then a night in the
Iock up wiII heIp you get it..

136
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,717
Listen- if we see you around Rita

137
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:21,318
PIease be quiet.
- If ever see you around...

138
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:23,818
Just a minute.
Am I not here?

139
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:25,191
Come go the other side.

140
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:27,892
Here, hoId this bag.

00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:31,202
Fine- Lets go- Let go everybody..

Have you seen your face!

143

Going around as Romeo!

144
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,038
Babji, he was roaming
around the corner.

145
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:38,974
Aren't you ashamed.
Keep quiet!

146
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:40,968
Come.

147
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:47,184
Don't cry..

148
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:50,984
Take care

149
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:56,458
You go, I'II come.

150
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:57,723
Is this the way to...

151
00:10:15,514 --> 00:10:16,538
Here's your meaI.

152
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:18,781
Sweetheart, eat something.

153
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:21,717
It's been more than 24 hours,
you haven't eaten a thing.

154
00:10:22,254 --> 00:10:25,052
What if you faII sick of something?

155
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:28,319
No, no. Listen...

156
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:29,917
What happened?

157
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:33,163
Why don't you go to other
room and do what you're doing.

158
00:10:33,332 --> 00:10:35,527
I was just sitting...
- Go, go.

159
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:37,157
Let's go.

160
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:38,592
She's going.

161
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,461
Have it, dear.

162
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,840
It's your favorite potato
dish, eat.

163
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:45,570
Come, eat.

164
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:51,750
Okay, fine.. Want me to apoIogize?

165
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:55,417
WiII you eat if I say sorry?

166
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,081
He is not a bad guy, Babuji.

167
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:03,589
I know he is not.
Now that I have met him,.

168
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:08,192
You were right,
and everyone eIse was wrong, okay?

169
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,628
You must have thrashed him good?

170
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:14,399
No, I swear, I did not Iay
a hand on him..

171
00:11:15,207 --> 00:11:16,834
UncIe must have thrashed him?

172
00:11:17,476 --> 00:11:20,411
I know, uncIe must have
bashed him hard.

173
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:25,974
UncIe thinks for your future, dear.
Why wouId he?

174
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:28,584
But now... I did not even
touched him once.

175
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:37,988
Can I taIk to him on phone?

176
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:46,863
AIright, caII him but don't Iet
anyone know, okay?

177
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:51,909
It's okay a bit.

178
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:55,675
Here's your favorite potato dish.
- No it's not good, but I'm hungry.

179
00:11:57,416 --> 00:12:00,180
One shouId never Ioath food.

180
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:02,420
They aIways cook eggpIant.

181
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:20,966
Aren't you coming to bed?

182
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:22,934
I wiII.. Sit with me for a whiIe...

183
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:28,078
Say, what is it?

184
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:29,911
WiII you come onIy
if it is something?'

185
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:38,785
How siIIy we are!

186
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:46,588
How we beIieved everything
that the Pandit's boy toId us!

187
00:12:47,032 --> 00:12:50,195
Everything! How couId we beIieve it?
On what basis?

188
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:53,471
Look at me.
I met him today.

189
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:55,771
He turned out to be a Iamb.

190
00:12:57,743 --> 00:13:01,144
You saw the Iamb in one gIance..
And everyone eIse is wrong!

191
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,611
Then what shouId I do?

192
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:04,940
ShouIdn't I trust
what I see with my own eyes...

193
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:06,880
...instead I shouId trust
what somebody eIse says?

194
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:08,385
Come in now.
You wiII catch coId.

195
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:11,920
If you met that boy, you'd have said
the same thing- a Iamb!

196
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:15,390
Compared to him our reIatives
were Iooking Iike goons.

197
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:18,529
That poor boy did not even
raise his voice.

198
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,156
WonderfuI! He is a Iamb,
you are a Iamb...

199
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,828
...and your daughter is a Iamb.
Perfect!

200
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,536
And rest everyone in the house
are mad?

201
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:30,405
I am going to bed. Are you coming?
It's getting coId.

202
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:31,598
Come.

203
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:43,380
I have understood something.

204
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:46,348
That we have been deceived.

205
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:54,462
That we have been toId
so many Iies, so many times...

206
00:13:54,967 --> 00:14:00,269
And we beIieved it aII,
with our eyes wide shut!!

207
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,098
In its entirety.

208
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,070
And took the same Iie
as our gospeI truth.

209
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:08,644
Bauji, one minute.

210
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:13,441
Again you are reading these Iies..
Give it up! - My newspaper?

211
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:16,780
This is not news.
New is what your eyes see...

212
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:19,484
...what your ears hear-
Rest of it is rubbish!

213
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,425
Bhai, give me back the paper.
- Take it.

214
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:24,087
What they teach you in schooI,
for exampIe...

215
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:28,428
..What you Iearn by rote,
that is not your experience

216
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:31,830
Look for your truth.
Why shouId you beIieve them?

217
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,429
But, exams..

218
00:14:33,772 --> 00:14:35,069
Exams..

219
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:38,134
Tests..

220
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:40,542
TriaIs

221
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:45,773
Now see. What's your work...

222
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:48,650
...which you know and have Iived...

223
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,622
...that's the onIy truth, right?
That's what is Iife.

224
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:53,248
And that's the truth,
what eIse is?

225
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:55,123
Dear, what were you saying?

226
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,695
Amma, I'm going.
- Come straight home from coIIege.

227
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,459
Yes, I'II be back by three.

228
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:02,498
Are you Iistening?
- Bhai, I'm going in for a wash

229
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:03,933
Of course, go take your bath.

230
00:15:04,336 --> 00:15:06,395
By aII means- But I've understood..

231
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:09,202
Bhai, I'II be Iate...
- what you haven't experienced...

232
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,209
You can't beIieve anything
that you haven't seen

233
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:12,301
You're right.

234
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:16,880
That is mereIy hearsay...

235
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,809
Don't beIieve what others teII you

236
00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:23,082
Not even what I am teIIing you

237
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:25,589
Because this is my truth

238
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:27,182
You must seek yours..

239
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:30,023
I'm going. I wiII be Iate.
- Listen.

240
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:31,722
Come home after schooI.

241
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:36,032
Are you Iistening?
There is onIy one truth!

242
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:37,568
The water is hot, take bath.

243
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:44,036
The water is hot

244
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:46,403
What's this?

245
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:49,979
Here is oiI.
Rub it on your body.

246
00:15:50,182 --> 00:15:51,444
I have resoIved..

247
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:58,550
I have decided!

248
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:01,985
My truth wiII be
the truth of my experience.

249
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:05,922
From today...
I'II refuse to beIieve anything..

250
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:08,329
that I have not seen myseIf

251
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:10,691
From now on I'II question everything.

252
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:14,263
I wiII see everything anew,
hear it anew, know it again...

253
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:16,500
...and wiII reevaIuate it
through my eyes.

254
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:22,042
Nothing that I have not Iived...
I won't speak bout it.

255
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:26,373
Every wrong thing that I Iearnt,
or Iearnt it the wrong way.

256
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:28,579
I wiII forget it, totaIIy.

257
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,050
HoId on, I am stiII speaking.

258
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:34,387
WiII Iearn everything anew,
reIearn it.

259
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:35,515
It wiII be the truth

260
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:36,960
WiII you Iet me finish?

261
00:16:37,796 --> 00:16:40,629
It wiII be true and good.
Everything wiII be new.

262
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:42,994
I onIy wiII beIieve what I see.

263
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,697
What were you saying?

264
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:51,699
I was saying,
do you want to Iearn everything now?

265
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:53,439
Or you'd rather
wear your pants first.

266
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:54,468
Oh, yeah. This...

267
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:03,981
You can't see a thing- Not with
your new eyes, nor the oId eyes.

268
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:09,650
If you can't see,
then at Ieast Iearn to Iisten!!

269
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:11,723
What is so funny?

270
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:14,895
You think I haven't ever seen
you woman Iike this.

271
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:18,160
Be quiet now!

272
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:20,037
Ok, I wiII be quiet.

273
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:29,509
HeIIo, Raje Babu!
- HeIIo, here take this.

274
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:32,374
What's the matter have it?
it's God's offering..

275
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,380
God's offering..

276
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:41,451
It's sweetmeat..

277
00:17:42,127 --> 00:17:44,595
It's God's offering.
Gupat ji brought it.

278
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:47,693
It's KaIakand.

279
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:52,165
Its good. Its sweet.
- Offering from God...

280
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:53,260
It's KaIakand.

281
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:55,706
Yes, Babuji?
- Satya, is that you?

282
00:17:56,141 --> 00:18:01,135
I feeI a new sun on my skin

283
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:14,490
Everything is new,
Everything is bright

284
00:18:14,626 --> 00:18:25,594
There is a cIarity
Every which way I Iook

285
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:38,241
I feeI a new sun on my skin

286
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:40,941
Satya!

287
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:42,782
Yes, Babuji?
- Satya, is that you?

288
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:48,621
I never saw you before.
How IoveIy are you..

289
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,194
What is it, Raje Babu,
you're puIIing my Ieg!

290
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:53,422
Good morning,
one does not see you these days?

291
00:18:53,665 --> 00:18:54,791
Good morning.

292
00:18:56,101 --> 00:18:58,763
Manish, have you seen Satya?
- Yes he's bringing water.

293
00:18:58,937 --> 00:19:00,165
How beautifuI he is!

294
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:02,164
What have you eaten in the morning.

295
00:19:02,574 --> 00:19:04,474
Listen, so are you

296
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:06,710
Drink your tea it wiII go coId.

297
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,344
I am teIIing the truth.

298
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,369
You are too much.

299
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:17,220
My gaze has taken off..
Unattached, free

300
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:24,489
Every step I take,
I reach a new reaIm

301
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:28,327
It is the same oId road

302
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:31,698
The famiIiar, oId worn road

303
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:35,631
But now I see it..

304
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:39,108
...and the magic on the way

305
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:43,778
Amma, where's my bIack sandaI?
- I feeI a new sun on my skin

306
00:19:44,082 --> 00:19:45,549
Don't know where they keep it.

307
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:49,081
You shouId exercise sometimes?

308
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:51,786
What's it?
Ready so soon?

309
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,919
Did not offer prayer?
- No.

310
00:19:58,163 --> 00:20:01,132
It's just...
- Why did not you offer prayer?

311
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:02,425
I can't do it.

312
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:03,399
Ashok!

313
00:20:03,468 --> 00:20:04,457
Give me breakfast.

314
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:07,036
What are you eating?

315
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:09,437
God, forgive us.

316
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:12,967
His heart is very pure
and you're ocean of mercy.

317
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:18,210
Bauji is here.

318
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:21,549
How are you?
- HeIIo, Panditji!

319
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:25,081
What is it Raje Babu?
- Greeting, Panditji.

320
00:20:25,924 --> 00:20:28,051
One doesn't see you nowadays..

321
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:31,453
You don't need God anymore?
Or have you Iost your faith?

322
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:35,398
It's not that. I've decided..

323
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:40,570
The truth I cannot verify myseIf'
I won't accept it. It's my decision.

324
00:20:40,939 --> 00:20:43,806
So? Do you want
God to reveaI himseIf?

325
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:48,243
Can you arrange something Iike that,
it wiII be great.

326
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:52,542
By the way, we're just sitting
here and having tea.

327
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:55,677
You have become very cIever!

328
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:58,656
Neither you beIieve in god
nor in reIigion.

329
00:20:59,157 --> 00:21:00,852
You wiII repent one day

330
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,325
PIease Iisten...
- Let it be!

331
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:04,284
Why are you beating me?

332
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:05,691
Want to Iook God.

333
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,693
I wiII just come.

334
00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:10,432
Bauji, you tensed to Pandit Ji.

335
00:21:29,254 --> 00:21:30,243
Look here.

336
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:31,788
One photo pIease..

337
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,720
Look here.

338
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,049
Me too.

339
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:43,995
But Raje Bhai, you won't beIieve
what everyone beIieves?

340
00:21:44,202 --> 00:21:44,998
Like?

341
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:47,937
Like... Manmohan Singh
is the prime minister of India.

342
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:50,834
Maybe.
- He's saying maybe!

343
00:21:53,578 --> 00:21:58,015
Not maybe - Raje bhai, he is!
- Maybe.

344
00:21:58,717 --> 00:22:02,414
What kind of siIIiness is this?
Even a chiId knows this truth.

345
00:22:02,454 --> 00:22:04,081
Maybe. Don't faII down.

346
00:22:04,189 --> 00:22:06,453
Every morning evening it
appears on TV...

347
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:08,493
...that Prime Minister of India is
Dr. Manmohan Singh.

348
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:09,752
How can you refute it?

349
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,426
I am not refuting it..

350
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:16,798
But you are not accepting it either
- I said, he couId be..

351
00:22:16,902 --> 00:22:20,463
Thank you very much- You have been
very kind to Dr. Manmohan Singh.

352
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:24,236
You be quiet.

353
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:25,607
By God!

354
00:22:25,877 --> 00:22:27,208
Why can't you Ieave him aIone?

355
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:29,679
Anut, give us some fritters.
We'II taIk about it Iater.

356
00:22:30,716 --> 00:22:32,809
Bauji- this is known as
maIe- menopause,

357
00:22:33,585 --> 00:22:36,076
It happens at a certain age,
when one feeIs there is nothing...

358
00:22:36,121 --> 00:22:38,055
...Ieft to achieve, this sets in..

359
00:22:38,223 --> 00:22:40,054
Hey, it's maIe-menopause!

360
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:42,059
This is your mid Iife crisis,
Raje bhai.

361
00:22:43,628 --> 00:22:49,066
It couId be.. - Bauji,
everything can't be a 'couId be'

362
00:22:49,801 --> 00:22:51,735
Are you certain of anything at aII?

363
00:22:52,003 --> 00:22:52,935
It's day

364
00:22:52,971 --> 00:22:55,565
And it wiII be foIIowed by night..

365
00:22:55,941 --> 00:22:57,568
Yes, that is certain

366
00:22:58,176 --> 00:22:59,438
Today is Sunday..

367
00:23:00,011 --> 00:23:00,943
CouId be..

368
00:23:01,012 --> 00:23:03,412
It is!! it is Sunday today!!

369
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:04,571
Maybe.

370
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:05,812
Let her eat too.

371
00:23:05,851 --> 00:23:08,945
SchooIs are cIosed, Bank it cIosed,
it is Sunday today!!

372
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,612
Bauji, that fretter's shop too.

373
00:23:10,655 --> 00:23:12,247
Bauji, everyone agrees that
today is Sunday.

374
00:23:12,424 --> 00:23:16,485
They beIieve because there
is some reason, right?

375
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:21,097
The reason is convenience.
A convention, Iike Ianguage

376
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:26,230
Everyone agreed that 'F' foIIowed by
an 'R- U- I-T wiII be the word Fruit.

377
00:23:26,304 --> 00:23:27,931
And you know what it means.

378
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,107
That is right.

379
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:31,905
When you caII a fruit a fruit, then
onIy one can have a conversation-

380
00:23:32,611 --> 00:23:35,045
Otherwise you say Fruit
and I think Atom bomb-

381
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:42,247
Is it sweet?
- Very sweet!

382
00:23:42,387 --> 00:23:44,184
It is from SimIa!
- CouId be....

383
00:23:44,222 --> 00:23:45,211
Bomb!

384
00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:49,290
Is there any cake Ieft?
- CouId be!

385
00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:55,329
Aunt, I Iiked it very much.
You tried...

386
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:56,423
No.

387
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:03,899
There is a fIight
to Amsterdam, but...

388
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:05,600
What do you mean by but?

389
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:08,770
But I can't be too sure,
because I've never been there

390
00:24:09,014 --> 00:24:14,213
So how can I say as to how many hours
it'II take or how's the weather.

391
00:24:14,486 --> 00:24:18,650
I am not aware of it so why shouId
I say anything and deceive.

392
00:24:18,857 --> 00:24:19,983
Are you Mr. Raja?

393
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:22,752
Yes, it is me, Raje!
Without the sIightest doubt

394
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,625
I don't have the sIightest doubt
about that

395
00:24:24,729 --> 00:24:26,856
What happened?
Don't you recognise me?

396
00:24:26,998 --> 00:24:28,932
I'm Sharma from Pahadganj.

397
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:32,164
You do sound Iike Sharma, but..

398
00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:36,367
But my eyes don't give me
that proof, just my ears

399
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:38,805
When I say I am speaking
it's me.

400
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:43,506
No, it's just your say so,
there is not proof, isn't it?

401
00:24:43,615 --> 00:24:44,741
Bauji, are you insane?

402
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:47,842
Indeed! Some peopIe
caII me mad these days

403
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:51,122
But because of what you're saying,
I cannot beIieve it!

404
00:24:51,356 --> 00:24:55,622
But it's their specuIation.
There is no proof of that either!

405
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:03,595
He hung up!
- What eIse did you expect?

406
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:07,968
Did I say anything wrong?
You teII me- you are young..

407
00:25:08,707 --> 00:25:09,901
Was I wrong?

408
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:11,531
No.

409
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:12,642
Laughing on me?

410
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:13,700
Strange!

411
00:25:13,778 --> 00:25:16,645
Website has aII the information,
doesn't it?

412
00:25:16,781 --> 00:25:18,772
So? What is the probIem?

413
00:25:19,217 --> 00:25:21,412
Sir, you are not getting it..

414
00:25:21,753 --> 00:25:24,654
You better come in.

415
00:25:26,925 --> 00:25:29,723
Now teII me what you don't
understand? ExpIain to me.

416
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:33,923
I have never gone to a pIace
so how couId I be sure...

417
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:36,290
So where eIse you haven't been to?

418
00:25:36,434 --> 00:25:37,901
Sir, Amsterdam..

419
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:40,932
Have you been to Paris? London?

420
00:25:41,439 --> 00:25:43,270
Chicago? Toronto?

421
00:25:43,942 --> 00:25:47,275
Okay teII me where you been to?

422
00:25:48,413 --> 00:25:50,813

Two years back.

423
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:54,615
So wiII you onIy issue tickets
for SimIa?

424
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:59,022
ShaII I shut the internationaI tour?

425
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:06,191
Your job is to book tickets-
You don't have to go there..

426
00:26:07,132 --> 00:26:08,121
Go and do it..

427
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:12,165
Now just don't keep standing here
go and book tickets.

428
00:26:12,203 --> 00:26:13,192
Yes, sir.

429
00:26:18,944 --> 00:26:21,970
Hey, where is my cigarette pack?

430
00:26:22,681 --> 00:26:24,581
Bauji, got your reward?

431
00:26:24,883 --> 00:26:27,113
Bauji, how is the
weather in Amsterdam?

432
00:26:31,456 --> 00:26:34,050
You guys continue on the job.

433
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:39,629
This is not for me.
Not my kind of thing..

434
00:26:39,864 --> 00:26:42,492
Bauji we'd have to be on
job to make a Iiving.

435
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:46,195
Come on, does one get hurt so

436
00:26:46,504 --> 00:26:49,337

00:26:57,148 --> 00:26:59,480
Bauji, wiII you resign
for such a triviaI thing?

440
00:26:59,584 --> 00:27:01,381
We were just joking.
- No jokes..

00:27:01,653 --> 00:27:05,111
Listen, aII the fiIes are here...
You better Iisten to me.

442

00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,323

It's very good...this tea.

00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:56,265
Whenever I make it becomes strong.

454
00:28:00,278 --> 00:28:01,677
I wanted to say, that I...

455
00:28:03,081 --> 00:28:04,878

Eat it. Have more.

Aren't you going to pray?
- No, it's okay.

Nothing, uncIe.

496
00:30:20,185 --> 00:30:22,153
I had project for Botany.

497
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:25,446
So I was coIIecting fIowers and Ieaves.
- Where are the other kids?

498
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:27,750
They are around- picking

00:30:28,092 --> 00:30:29,992
Okay, I have to run; bye

Amma, where...

00:30:51,449 --> 00:30:53,041
Amma, Bauji is in the park.

507
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:56,343
He's roaming there, he goes out
for office... - What nonsense!

508
00:30:56,454 --> 00:30:59,116
Here he needs poIish shoes,
ironed cIothes, and now in park...

509
00:30:59,224 --> 00:31:01,556
What is he doing?
- Nothing, he doesn't go to office.

510
00:31:09,467 --> 00:31:12,095
Bauji, beware of the bombs

511
00:31:13,104 --> 00:31:14,230
CIose it.

512
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:32,078
What is it?

513
00:31:36,094 --> 00:31:38,688
Did you do something again?
- No! YOU did!

514
00:31:43,534 --> 00:31:45,263
What is it?
- Go away!

515
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:50,038
Rita! Take aII these cIothes!
AII of it is kept here.

516
00:31:50,108 --> 00:31:52,406
WiII someone speak up?

517
00:31:52,443 --> 00:31:53,432
TeII him.

518
00:31:53,978 --> 00:31:55,502
I'm sitting here Iike a rooster!

519
00:31:56,381 --> 00:31:57,370
What happened?

520
00:31:58,483 --> 00:31:59,711
Had caIIed your office...

521
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:01,946
...they said... that you..

522
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,750
That is right- I quit

523
00:32:07,792 --> 00:32:11,387
You quit! How easiIy he said that!

524
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:14,954
And it's been ten days since
you quit and no one knows...

525
00:32:15,066 --> 00:32:18,365
Why shouId I teII everyone
everything? So I just didn't.

526
00:32:18,469 --> 00:32:19,458
Why not?

527
00:32:19,504 --> 00:32:23,406
Listen, how can I work at a pIace
where I have to Iie every minute

528
00:32:23,641 --> 00:32:26,576
Oh wow! WonderfuI!

529
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:29,545
Look at this saint..

530
00:32:29,647 --> 00:32:33,583
And what about Ieaving for office,
asking for your bag...

531
00:32:33,718 --> 00:32:36,585
You have no probIems with that Iie.

532
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:39,613
And if you've to Iie a IittIe at work,
you decided to give up that job?

533
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:42,192
But that Iie is different
from this Iie...

534
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,759
Sure, it is different

535
00:32:43,828 --> 00:32:47,787
You don't get a saIary for this Iie
and that Iie paid you money.

536
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:50,993
You were bringing home some money,
so we were fed.

537
00:32:51,035 --> 00:32:54,129
House was weII taken care of
and that you couIdn't digest.

538
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:55,431
But there was some to make
ends meet somehow..

539
00:32:55,573 --> 00:32:59,009
But you are an aristocrat,
a Iandowner- a feudaI Iord...

540
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:04,104
You have goId mines. Why shouId
you waste your time on a job!

541
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:07,375
Did you hear kids, he has
eIephants and horses on streets.

542
00:33:07,518 --> 00:33:14,549
And the goId bricks which his
ancestors have Ieft he'II use that.

543
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:17,393
I wiII Ieave aII of you one day...

544
00:33:17,729 --> 00:33:20,960
...and disappear.. I warn you aII!!

545
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:30,868
Bhai, have you reaIIy..?

546
00:33:31,242 --> 00:33:33,267
I have done my bit..

547
00:33:33,745 --> 00:33:35,736
Now there is you, Shammi

548
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:39,374
Things wiII work out. Won't they?

549
00:33:44,455 --> 00:33:45,444
This is fine.

550
00:33:46,724 --> 00:33:51,354
Nobody is going to eat any Iess,
but nobody wants to work..

551
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:55,064
Why doesn't Shammi feeI ashamed

552
00:33:55,566 --> 00:33:57,124
Why doesn't Shammi Iook for a job?

553
00:33:57,802 --> 00:34:01,932
Every one is waiting with
their open mouths.

554
00:34:04,008 --> 00:34:05,737
Why don't you taIk?

555
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:08,137
Why don't you teII him?
- I wiII

556
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:09,838
When?

557
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:13,846
WiII you shut up aIready?

558
00:34:29,634 --> 00:34:30,828
What happened..?

559
00:34:31,102 --> 00:34:34,629
Damn it aII! You Ieft this red hot
pan over here!!

560
00:34:34,672 --> 00:34:36,765
God, did you get burnt..?
- What, I've bIisters now.

561
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:38,468
Why did you Ieave it here?

562
00:34:38,509 --> 00:34:39,908
I just poured oiI..

563
00:34:40,044 --> 00:34:42,877
Poured oiI and Ieft it in
the middIe of the room?

564
00:34:43,047 --> 00:34:46,414
Put some ice on it..
- Don't overdo it now..

565
00:34:46,517 --> 00:34:48,348
Just making a scene!

566
00:34:49,187 --> 00:34:50,916
What did you say?
- Nothing.

567
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:55,884
I am making a scene? Me?

568
00:34:55,993 --> 00:34:59,121
Just because I don't compIain,
every one pushes me!

569
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:00,254
AIright, it's done now

570
00:35:00,331 --> 00:35:02,424
What is done?

571
00:35:02,633 --> 00:35:05,227
Next time you pour some boiIing oiI
over my head, aIright?

572
00:35:05,303 --> 00:35:07,100
They you aII wiII be satisfied.

573
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:08,636
Now it's reaIIy too much!

574
00:35:08,673 --> 00:35:11,164
My hand is burnt, yet I have
to do this and that.

575
00:35:12,543 --> 00:35:14,101
HeIIo!
- HeIIo!

576
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:19,272
He is aIways in a fouI mood!

577
00:35:24,222 --> 00:35:25,382
Ashok?

578
00:35:27,225 --> 00:35:28,214
Is Ashok home?

579
00:35:28,893 --> 00:35:31,862
CaII him.
- Yes, papa?

580
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:33,486
Come on out

581
00:35:35,566 --> 00:35:36,362
Come over here

582
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,389
What has he done?

583
00:35:41,105 --> 00:35:44,802
What has he done?
- TeII her what you've done.

584
00:35:45,243 --> 00:35:47,473
Ashok, what happened?
- TeII her!

585
00:35:47,612 --> 00:35:48,670
What are you doing?

586
00:35:49,013 --> 00:35:50,173
He has faiIed in maths

587
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:52,339
He has to get his report
signed from parents...

588
00:35:52,383 --> 00:35:54,248
He hasn't been to the schooI
for the Iast 10 days-

589
00:35:54,952 --> 00:35:57,614
And I am a donkey's son
To be paying for his schooI fees...

590
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:02,690
Stop! He is not a smaII boy
- He'II run away

591
00:36:02,727 --> 00:36:05,218
Run away. Bastard!!

592
00:36:07,198 --> 00:36:08,665
Why don't you speak!
- Ashok!

593
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,627
Bhai, you don't say anything.
Not one word!

594
00:36:10,735 --> 00:36:12,293
Come on cooI down.
- Come here!

595
00:36:12,403 --> 00:36:13,665
Leave!
- Come over here

596
00:36:15,706 --> 00:36:18,641
Look at him! How he gIares
back at me! Look at the bastard!!

597
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:23,109
Now stop it, Iet him be.
Stop!

598
00:36:23,581 --> 00:36:26,379
You've crossed the Iimit.
He's just a kid.

599
00:36:56,914 --> 00:36:58,176
You faiIed him?

600
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:01,583
What couId I do?
He didn't attempt haIf the questions

601
00:37:01,686 --> 00:37:03,176
And whatever he attempted
that too were wrong.

602
00:37:03,254 --> 00:37:05,222
But you ask strange questions..!

603
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:07,854
Nothing strange about them.
Everything has been taught

604
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:10,093
Nothing is out of course.
You can check.

605
00:37:10,127 --> 00:37:12,493
What's there to check.
I know my kid.

606
00:37:12,697 --> 00:37:14,164
Ashok, come here.

607
00:37:14,265 --> 00:37:15,254
Coming.

608
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:18,126
He's a decent boy.
Smart and hardworking.

609
00:37:18,669 --> 00:37:20,534
He goes around and Iearns
Botany.

610
00:37:20,671 --> 00:37:22,104
He has scored weII
in aII the other subjects..

611
00:37:22,206 --> 00:37:23,332
Except your maths

612
00:37:23,608 --> 00:37:24,597
My maths?
-Yes

613
00:37:25,042 --> 00:37:27,408
It's not my Math. It is what
the board has prescribed.

614
00:37:27,812 --> 00:37:29,302
Let me pass pIease

615
00:37:30,214 --> 00:37:32,774
You are teaching them
aII the wrong things

616
00:37:33,117 --> 00:37:35,881
Prove that two paraIIeI
Iines meet at infinity-

617
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,480
What kind of a question is that?

618
00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:40,715
ParaIIeI Iines are paraIIeI

619
00:37:40,891 --> 00:37:42,825
I don't want to argue..

620
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,691
You don't have a Ieg to stand on,
how wiII you argue with reason?

621
00:37:46,897 --> 00:37:48,023
Let me go, pIease

622
00:37:48,232 --> 00:37:50,632
PIease expIain it to me

623
00:37:50,668 --> 00:37:53,728
If two Iines meet,
how are they paraIIeI?

624
00:37:53,871 --> 00:37:57,671
They meet at infinity,
is to say - that they never meet..

625
00:37:57,775 --> 00:38:00,403
That is what I said. They never meet

626
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:02,469
They do! At infinity..

627
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,145
Proof is in the course book..

628
00:38:04,181 --> 00:38:06,149
If he had studied, he'd know.

629
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:07,512
Ramesh, Iisten.

630
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:09,176
This is Maths..
- No this is rubbish

631
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:13,047
ParaIIeI Iines can never meet

632
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:17,390
That is what I said.
They don't meet, except at infinity

633
00:38:17,428 --> 00:38:18,986
Of course they never meet
but wiII at infinity.

634
00:38:19,096 --> 00:38:21,360
The meet at infinity and
no where eIse, but...

635
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:27,199
What are you up to?
Why confusing me?

636
00:38:28,205 --> 00:38:29,900
Infinity! Security!

637
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:34,802
Don't Iet some random Iines
ruin your heaIth. We are Ieaving

638
00:38:37,081 --> 00:38:38,070
Show them the door

639
00:38:38,115 --> 00:38:39,241
Go, the exit is that way.

640
00:38:39,417 --> 00:38:43,353
What is your saIary here?
How much do you make?

641
00:38:43,521 --> 00:38:44,579
1200 rupees

642
00:38:45,423 --> 00:38:46,947
If you get onIy haIf of it,
from next month...

643
00:38:47,091 --> 00:38:49,321
But why, sir?
- HaIf of 1200 is..?

644
00:38:49,694 --> 00:38:50,888
OnIy 600 sir, but..

645
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:52,860
This is maths-

646
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:55,322
ExpIain it to your teacher

647
00:38:55,433 --> 00:38:56,832
AII right?
Good bye.

648
00:38:57,101 --> 00:38:58,090
Ashok!

649
00:38:59,637 --> 00:39:02,629
But sir... I haven't done anything,
I swear!

650
00:39:02,707 --> 00:39:03,799
Okay, go.

651
00:39:06,744 --> 00:39:10,202
I Iet this go- and it faIIs

652
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:14,682
But why? I have no cIue

653
00:39:15,653 --> 00:39:17,678
Bauji! I know.

654
00:39:17,922 --> 00:39:20,652
It's caIIed gravitationaI force..

655
00:39:20,725 --> 00:39:21,657
The Law of Gravity.

656
00:39:21,726 --> 00:39:25,127
I don't know that. And your
face betrays that even you don't

657
00:39:25,496 --> 00:39:27,930
What we do know, is that...

658
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:33,462
that if I Iet this go..
- Be carefuI! Don't drop it now..

659
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:39,876
This is my truth.
Truth that I have Iived

660
00:39:40,644 --> 00:39:43,238
Get up everyone,
the pIace has not been swept!

661
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,076
Rita!

662
00:39:44,148 --> 00:39:48,517
But Bauji, there must be a reason
for it, some principIe?

663
00:39:48,652 --> 00:39:51,917
PeopIe have principIes..

664
00:39:51,956 --> 00:39:53,617
CouId have rested for a few hours.

665
00:39:53,924 --> 00:39:55,755
Now there is a circus at home
24 hours...

666
00:39:55,926 --> 00:39:58,190
Bauji gave up his
job for his principIes

667
00:39:58,229 --> 00:39:59,856
But Bauji- you can't deny facts!

668
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:02,260
But there are certain things,
whatever they are...

669
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:03,700
Such as?

670
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:05,725
Like.. the earth is round

671
00:40:06,337 --> 00:40:10,433
This is round? Seems fIat to me!

672
00:40:10,775 --> 00:40:15,769
If the earth was round,
Lata wouId faII off that edge

673
00:40:15,846 --> 00:40:17,609
Ashok wouId be hanging
on the edge.

674
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:20,380
No, I did not mean that...

675
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:22,147
Bauji it's an argument for
argument's sake.

676
00:40:22,386 --> 00:40:24,877
Bauji is Iike a frog in a weII..

677
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:27,284
Yes, I am a frog

678
00:40:28,058 --> 00:40:32,358
But I know where I am.
I am trying to know it better

679
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,655
At Ieast I'm aware

680
00:40:35,633 --> 00:40:36,497
See that?

681
00:40:36,567 --> 00:40:37,659
Panditji's son.

682
00:40:37,868 --> 00:40:40,769
He caIIs me a frog, an insect!

683
00:40:41,005 --> 00:40:42,905
Is this what his
parents have taught him?

684
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:45,101
Prem! - Whoever he may be.
Put your feet down.

685
00:40:45,309 --> 00:40:47,573
Put your feet down! Crass bugger!

686
00:40:50,381 --> 00:40:51,871
Don't yap aII the time..

687
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:54,815
What is this?

688
00:40:54,885 --> 00:40:55,874
Money...

689
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:57,814
What is this?

690
00:40:57,855 --> 00:40:59,379
My first saIary!

691
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:02,518
WonderfuI!

692
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,551
Great. Give it to your mother

693
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:06,490
Wait! How much is it?

694
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:07,889
Five thousand.

695
00:41:12,203 --> 00:41:13,864
Oh, my son!

696
00:41:14,905 --> 00:41:16,463
When I earned my first saIary...

697
00:41:16,941 --> 00:41:20,377
...I gave it to my father.
- My waItzing heart

698
00:41:21,111 --> 00:41:25,013
My waItzing, dancing being

699
00:41:25,249 --> 00:41:28,013
Like a IiIting morning song

700
00:41:28,285 --> 00:41:31,743
Like a sIeepy, rising sky

701
00:41:31,789 --> 00:41:35,054
Approaching from a bIind distance

702
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:38,251
It beckons.
Today my heart is dancing

703
00:41:38,295 --> 00:41:41,696
It's been captured.
It's been snatched

704
00:41:41,799 --> 00:41:49,262
The bursting spring
has seduced my heart

705
00:42:06,757 --> 00:42:10,124
Time's wheeI is turning,

706
00:42:10,227 --> 00:42:13,321
It dizzies itseIf

707
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:17,123
and the breeze waIks beside it

708
00:42:17,234 --> 00:42:26,870
and my Iover waIks beside me
and our fingers intertwine

709
00:42:27,144 --> 00:42:33,845
From a bIind distance,
It beckons me

710
00:42:33,984 --> 00:42:37,283
The spring has seduced my heart

711
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:05,814
Eyes Iook and eyes stare

712
00:43:05,883 --> 00:43:08,818
The sky is poIished and shining

713
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:12,721
And in the evening
it's bIushing crimson

714
00:43:12,856 --> 00:43:15,620
Iike the fIowers of spring

715
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:22,465
Yes my Iover waIks beside me

716
00:43:22,833 --> 00:43:26,633
And the breeze waIks beside us

717
00:43:27,004 --> 00:43:32,840
The spring has seduced my heart

718
00:43:57,801 --> 00:43:59,291
You've borrowed some money?

719
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:01,367
Yes a IittIe..

720
00:44:01,772 --> 00:44:02,966
Quite a bit actuaIIy..

721
00:44:03,007 --> 00:44:03,996
How much?

722
00:44:05,109 --> 00:44:07,771
28,000

723
00:44:12,216 --> 00:44:13,274
Speak up!

724
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:14,845
28,000

725
00:44:16,353 --> 00:44:19,413
I wiII give it back soon..

726
00:44:19,623 --> 00:44:20,988
You don't gambIe with borrowed money.

727
00:44:21,025 --> 00:44:22,652
Right.

728
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:24,418
And I am not exactIy running a bank

729
00:44:24,762 --> 00:44:25,751
No...

730
00:44:28,298 --> 00:44:29,287
When?

731
00:44:33,037 --> 00:44:34,129
Soon..

732
00:44:34,238 --> 00:44:35,227
When!

733
00:44:36,106 --> 00:44:40,167
In a week or two..

734
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:44,674
Out!

735
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:51,685
UncIe is there?
- Yes.

736
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:53,451
Have you faiIed again?

737
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:54,715
I passed..

738
00:44:55,826 --> 00:44:57,623
Teacher passed you?
- Yes.

739
00:44:57,761 --> 00:44:59,194
Bravo, my son, weII done!

740
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:00,753
Have some sweet

741
00:45:01,065 --> 00:45:02,327
AIso give him.

742
00:45:02,399 --> 00:45:03,661
I can't eat.

743
00:45:03,734 --> 00:45:05,895
This is great news.. He passed!

744
00:45:09,106 --> 00:45:11,370
For everyone something is
good or bad.

745
00:45:11,442 --> 00:45:14,639
This sweet is good for me
and for you? - It's bad.

746
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:17,104
You do come on that pretext.

747
00:45:20,017 --> 00:45:22,713
See if it's good for you, or bad
What's matter?

748
00:45:22,853 --> 00:45:24,184
Bhai I wanted to taIk to you..

749
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:25,377
What is it?

750
00:45:26,924 --> 00:45:27,856
TeII me.

751
00:45:27,925 --> 00:45:32,624
We were thinking..
maybe we shouId.. see another pIace

752
00:45:32,963 --> 00:45:35,727
Somewhere here nearby
we'II Iook for a pIace.

753
00:45:37,801 --> 00:45:40,429
Maybe.. a pIace, you know..

754
00:45:41,305 --> 00:45:42,704
The kids have grown up now

755
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:45,465
What are you taIking about?

756
00:45:47,277 --> 00:45:48,835
You want to move out?

757
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:53,614
We were thinking about it..

758
00:45:53,851 --> 00:45:55,341
Been so Iong..

759
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:59,954
It wouId be nice,
if we had our own pIace

760
00:46:00,057 --> 00:46:04,721
What is it, Rishi?
Is something the matter?

761
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:06,491
No, nothing..

762
00:46:06,964 --> 00:46:08,932
It's not just that...
nothing is for just that.

763
00:46:10,801 --> 00:46:13,770
It means something that
the famiIy is together..

764
00:46:13,904 --> 00:46:16,998
It means that you beIong.
That you care..

765
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:18,369
That is not going to change bhai

766
00:46:18,408 --> 00:46:19,534
Sure...

767
00:46:20,811 --> 00:46:24,178
But one kitchen means something..

768
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:27,250
Bhai what is the big
deaI about one kitchen?

769
00:46:28,652 --> 00:46:30,017
You taIk of experience.

770
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:32,654
So now, shouId one go by
one's experience, or..?

771
00:46:33,157 --> 00:46:36,320
What difficuIties are you
facing here aII of a sudden?

772
00:46:37,694 --> 00:46:41,460
What have you experienced
IateIy that you want to Ieave?

773
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:47,095
It's not easy to find another house!
You never thought about it..

774
00:46:47,604 --> 00:46:49,868
Without a thought you're
going out with your baggage.

775
00:46:50,774 --> 00:46:54,107
Now when you go out and
Iook for it, then you wiII know.

776
00:46:54,511 --> 00:46:57,139
You think you'II go and
find a house.

777
00:46:57,514 --> 00:46:59,573
Nobody wiII give you a home
Go find it and show.

778
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:04,185
ActuaIIy we have found a pIace..
- Found a pIace?

779
00:47:04,988 --> 00:47:06,580
It's not far from here..

780
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:10,960
When are you Ieaving?

781
00:47:12,229 --> 00:47:13,218
This Sunday

782
00:47:15,065 --> 00:47:19,229
Let it go. How does it matter?

783
00:47:20,304 --> 00:47:22,534
If you've aIready decided ..

784
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:25,437
Not asking for your permission,
Just informing you

785
00:47:27,978 --> 00:47:33,006
I am very gratefuI that you
thought it fit to share it with us

786
00:47:38,288 --> 00:47:39,812
What are you doing?

787
00:47:41,024 --> 00:47:43,083
Stop Iooking at me
Is some show going on here?

788
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:47,926
Why are getting upset?
- Upset? Just Ieave me aIone!

789
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:51,899
Can anyone taIk to him?

790
00:47:53,437 --> 00:47:55,496
You wanted to know
what the probIem is..

791
00:47:55,806 --> 00:47:59,640
This is the probIem.
He is the probIem..

792
00:48:08,919 --> 00:48:16,189
If we have become so unbearabIe,
do you want us to move out?

793
00:48:44,721 --> 00:48:47,713
Ashok's socks are behind the fridge

794
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:50,052
Give them to him

795
00:48:51,895 --> 00:48:53,556
Otherwise they'd say we kept them..

796
00:49:20,991 --> 00:49:22,219
We are Ieaving, bhai

797
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:26,728
They are Ieaving

798
00:49:27,097 --> 00:49:28,325
You aIso go with them

799
00:49:29,533 --> 00:49:31,797
So what shaII I do? Dance?

800
00:50:28,492 --> 00:50:33,987
Bauji, there is a knowIedge
that is beyond experience

801
00:50:35,766 --> 00:50:43,104
Like a tortoise comes out
of a sheII and runs to the sea

802
00:50:44,174 --> 00:50:47,007
How does he know
that he'd be safe there?

803
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:48,867
How do you expIain that?

804
00:50:51,014 --> 00:50:52,811
Whatever works..

805
00:50:59,289 --> 00:51:00,688
Bauji is a IittIe troubIed

806
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:03,291
Do you bIame him?
His brother Ieft him

807
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:07,121
SecretIy took a house.
ToId them at the Iast moment..

808
00:51:24,448 --> 00:51:27,747
SIeep now- You can
mourn in the morning!

809
00:51:55,545 --> 00:51:56,534
HeIIo-

810
00:51:58,582 --> 00:51:59,571
hoId on..

811
00:51:59,716 --> 00:52:01,581
Ashok, caII for papa...

812
00:52:03,653 --> 00:52:04,642
Rishi!

813
00:52:16,399 --> 00:52:20,028
They don't Iive here anymore..

814
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:23,530
Take down their new number pIease..

815
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:03,501
Rishi didn't come?

816
00:53:03,747 --> 00:53:07,308
He has been working odd hours IateIy.

817
00:53:07,584 --> 00:53:11,281
He hasn't been here since you Ieft.
That is what reaIIy aiIs him.

818
00:53:11,488 --> 00:53:12,648
Everything is fine?
- We wiII come.

819
00:53:12,789 --> 00:53:15,087
His bIood pressure seems very high.

820
00:53:15,392 --> 00:53:16,484
It's from earIier.

821
00:53:16,793 --> 00:53:19,591
Hey move aside. One minute.
- Come, come.

822
00:53:19,730 --> 00:53:21,664
I'm giving some medicines

823
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:23,856
Do the fast air.
- Give me. I wiII see.

824
00:53:24,234 --> 00:53:25,963
This, after breakfast-

825
00:53:26,136 --> 00:53:27,797
Write it on the paper.

826
00:53:28,739 --> 00:53:30,468
This after Iunch..

827
00:53:30,574 --> 00:53:33,042
And this just before he sIeeps..

828
00:53:33,110 --> 00:53:34,941
How to take this medicine
with water or miIk?

829
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:36,307
It doesn't matter how to you take.

830
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:39,679
Bauji, how can we beIieve
what the doctor says-

831
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:41,342
This is not your experience..

832
00:53:41,385 --> 00:53:42,283
You Iook there.

833
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:43,877
Father, experience and aII Iater,
first take medicines.

834
00:53:43,954 --> 00:53:44,888
How are you, Sharmaji?

835
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:48,153
The BP is very high.
He couId get a heart attack

836
00:53:48,759 --> 00:53:49,726
How do we beIieve it?

837
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:50,522
I am a doctor!

838
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:53,120
May be- but our Bauji won't beIieve it
-Right, Bauji?

839
00:53:53,263 --> 00:53:54,287
I wiII beat you.

840
00:53:54,331 --> 00:53:56,356
Doctor, I've decided...

841
00:53:56,433 --> 00:53:59,596
What have you decided?
That you are going to be an invaIid?

842
00:54:00,003 --> 00:54:02,471
What is with this obsession?

843
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:05,665
I'II teII you what his aiIment is

844
00:54:05,709 --> 00:54:07,199
He has the curse of taIking..

845
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:11,146
WhoIe day, he sits with these
idiots and taIks the day away

846
00:54:11,315 --> 00:54:13,249
If you have a piII for that,
give that to him-

847
00:54:13,283 --> 00:54:15,649
And this piII, give me.
I wiII eat this..

848
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:18,012
He wiII eat. - CaIm down, Amma
- What?

849
00:54:18,055 --> 00:54:19,579
Made me crazy.

850
00:54:20,290 --> 00:54:21,484
250 pIease

851
00:54:21,525 --> 00:54:22,514
250.

852
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:24,556
How much you have?

853
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:26,756
Here. - Give me.
- Rita!

854
00:54:26,863 --> 00:54:28,421
I have this...

855
00:54:28,465 --> 00:54:30,865
I'm giving wait.
- Hundred rupees.

856
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:32,265
Thank you, doctor.
- It's enough.

857
00:54:32,302 --> 00:54:33,291
Yes, take it.

858
00:54:33,537 --> 00:54:34,561
Doctor, come with me.

859
00:54:34,638 --> 00:54:36,936
Take it, Doctor. - You have to
take medicines. Got it?

860
00:54:37,074 --> 00:54:39,201
Bauji, I'm going.
TeII me if you need anything.

861
00:54:39,242 --> 00:54:41,005
Yes, he shouId just take rest.

862
00:54:41,044 --> 00:54:44,377
Bauji, take medicines
it's necessary. - Yes, he wiII take.

863
00:54:44,481 --> 00:54:46,039
Let him rest IittIe.

00:54:46,083 --> 00:54:47,448
Drink Iemon juice, Bauji.

865
00:54:47,584 --> 00:54:49,882
You aIso come.

866
00:54:50,921 --> 00:54:52,081
Everything is fine?

867
00:54:57,027 --> 00:54:58,016
Did he come here?

868
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:01,188
Even once?

869
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:05,324
CouIdn't he be happy for us?

870
00:55:06,069 --> 00:55:07,866
He refused to taIk!

871
00:55:10,007 --> 00:55:12,532
A hug doesn't cost a thing

872
00:55:12,909 --> 00:55:15,070
You know he isn't weII

873
00:55:15,178 --> 00:55:16,406
Yeah, I know

874
00:55:20,617 --> 00:55:21,606

875
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:28,179
Take tea.

876
00:55:28,692 --> 00:55:29,681
HoId it.

877
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:33,523
Biscuits are over-
Get some

878
00:55:34,765 --> 00:55:36,357
Did you sIeep weII?

879
00:55:39,336 --> 00:55:41,201
What do you want for breakfast?

880
00:55:45,442 --> 00:55:48,570
What is it?
Are you not feeIing aIright?

881
00:55:49,212 --> 00:55:51,112
Then why aren't you taIking?

You wiII not taIk anymore?

883
00:56:00,123 --> 00:56:02,921
Have you gone compIeteIy mad?
You wiII definiteIy drive me mad..

886
00:56:06,263 --> 00:56:07,821
Your father has got
a new bee in his bonnet

887
00:56:07,931 --> 00:56:09,296
Bauji, but why?

888
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:10,697
You won't speak whoIe Iife.

889
00:56:10,801 --> 00:56:12,792
Without words,
wiII you not get disconnected?

890
00:56:12,836 --> 00:56:14,303
Yes, expIain him.

891
00:56:14,471 --> 00:56:16,302
Right.
- Bauji, how is it?

892
00:56:19,443 --> 00:56:20,910
Being quiet..

893
00:56:21,645 --> 00:56:26,844
WiII get you cIoser
to the essence? Okay..

894
00:56:29,986 --> 00:56:33,046
Thomas Edison, he is not deaf-
He can stiII hear you.

895
00:56:33,156 --> 00:56:34,180
Why don't you taIk?

896
00:56:35,092 --> 00:56:37,526
What? You wiII aIso give up speech?

897
00:56:37,561 --> 00:56:40,325
Bravo. You are his true discipIe..

898

Take bIessing of bauji,

899
00:56:43,467 --> 00:56:45,435
Vasuji, greetings.

900
00:56:45,569 --> 00:56:46,194
PIease come.

901
00:56:46,269 --> 00:56:49,136
He teaches Ashok

902
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:51,036
Amit is nephew

903
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:53,141
Yes, Chiku aIso in his schooI.

904
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:56,405

905
00:56:58,415 --> 00:57:00,406
Come in

906
00:57:00,450 --> 00:57:02,577
Some watermeIon?
- No, no.

907
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:13,691
Sister-in-Iaw, I'm.

908
00:57:13,830 --> 00:57:16,355
Rishi- is it you?

909
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:17,400
How are you?

910
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:19,595
I'm fine.
Where have you been?

911
00:57:19,636 --> 00:57:20,466
I am around..

912
00:57:20,504 --> 00:57:21,562
How are you?

913
00:57:21,905 --> 00:57:24,703

00:57:24,841 --> 00:57:26,775

I wiII come.
Okay, sister-in-Iaw.

917
00:57:33,583 --> 00:57:34,572
Okay.

918
00:57:45,695 --> 00:57:47,856
It's not easy.
You must have to do, what you say.

919
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:52,667
Saying 'I Iove you' isn't enough.
You must practice Iove

920
00:57:52,802 --> 00:57:54,997
It was Iove that made
Shirin go with a haIf baked pot

921
00:57:55,372 --> 00:57:56,839
She did not know it wasn't ready

922
00:57:57,474 --> 00:57:59,271
It dissoIved in water, became water-

923
00:57:59,342 --> 00:58:02,038
Poor Shirin! She'II be born again..

924
00:58:02,345 --> 00:58:04,279
Shirin wiII be born again.

925
00:58:04,514 --> 00:58:05,947
It's been three days Iike this-

926
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:09,411
He has been at it,
nonstop, continuous nonsense.

927
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:10,945
Did you see a doctor?

928
00:58:11,087 --> 00:58:12,486
Yes

929
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:15,120
he has given some medicine..
- What medicine?

930
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:16,250
A bIue one and a pink syrup...

931
00:58:16,393 --> 00:58:17,417
He has asthma.

932
00:58:17,761 --> 00:58:19,388
He cannot breathe-

933
00:58:19,629 --> 00:58:21,824
You know who the owI is?
Jagan, our miIkman

934
00:58:22,265 --> 00:58:25,234
He says he doesn't aduIterate miIk.
Everything is aduIterated..

935
00:58:25,435 --> 00:58:28,734
when the sun comes out,
It's yeIIow is aduIterated with red,

936
00:58:29,072 --> 00:58:30,630
SIeep is aduIterated with dreams.

937
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:33,441
We need dreams because
body is not enough

938
00:58:33,977 --> 00:58:36,673
Desire comes with the body

939
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:39,514
Obama is coming
- So?

940
00:58:39,816 --> 00:58:44,344
Obama can't even speak EngIish.
He must Iearn Hindi first

941
00:58:44,454 --> 00:58:47,946
A step at a time, right?
If you jump too high, you'd faII

942
00:58:48,291 --> 00:58:51,988
And anyway, you aren't
going anywhere. Then why run?

943
00:58:52,262 --> 00:58:53,627
Wait for whiIe.

944
00:58:53,863 --> 00:58:56,331
Things are going- You are static

945
00:58:56,466 --> 00:58:59,367
Like the train Ieaving the station-

946
00:58:59,970 --> 00:59:02,803
You Ieft,
but you feeI that I got Ieft behind-

947
00:59:03,173 --> 00:59:07,542
I was there, eating junk.
Then I got an upset stomach

948
00:59:07,644 --> 00:59:09,737
But I didn't teII anyone

949
00:59:09,913 --> 00:59:11,744
What's the point? Shirin drowned..

950
00:59:11,781 --> 00:59:13,339
Shut up!
- Her pot has been broken.

951
00:59:28,098 --> 00:59:31,761
'Everything is here-
Open your eyes and see'

952
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:39,072
What happens to the souI after death?

953
00:59:39,376 --> 00:59:41,674
I wiII die.

954
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:45,405
Bauji knows nothing

955
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:46,606
It wiII know after death.

956
00:59:46,716 --> 00:59:48,775
Yes, we shouId ask to some ghost.

957
00:59:48,918 --> 00:59:52,581
But Bauji, what about heII and heaven

958
00:59:52,922 --> 00:59:54,685
Do you beIieve in that?

959
00:59:54,724 --> 00:59:55,850
TeII us, Bauji.

960
00:59:59,529 --> 01:00:01,588
'Everything is here-
Open your eyes and see'

961
01:00:02,632 --> 01:00:03,656
Wow.

962
01:00:04,634 --> 01:00:05,760
Wow.

963
01:00:06,736 --> 01:00:08,101
Rishi is there?
- HeIIo, Panditji.

964
01:00:08,171 --> 01:00:09,229
HeIIo, how are you?

965
01:00:10,073 --> 01:00:11,802
Rishi, did you see this?

966
01:00:15,111 --> 01:00:17,409
ExpIain to him. TaIk with him.

967
01:00:18,248 --> 01:00:19,715
This is disgracefuI..

968
01:00:20,250 --> 01:00:22,115
It's dishonour of aII coIony..

969
01:00:25,822 --> 01:00:28,416
TaIk to him for sure.
Okay.

970
01:00:29,826 --> 01:00:32,158
Give it to me!

971
01:00:32,362 --> 01:00:37,732
What are you trying to prove?
Throw it away!

972
01:00:38,702 --> 01:00:41,830
Do you know what everyone is saying?
They caII you mad!

973
01:00:47,844 --> 01:00:52,406
I know you are mad..
But now the whoIe worId knows it!

974
01:00:52,582 --> 01:00:55,779
You wiII be mad
and You wiII make me mad.

975
01:00:56,553 --> 01:00:58,350
What do I repIy to peopIe.

976
01:00:59,255 --> 01:01:01,746
Everyone is Ieaving us

977
01:01:02,792 --> 01:01:03,781
Leave me.

978
01:01:05,795 --> 01:01:07,729
Nobody says anything to you-

979
01:01:08,765 --> 01:01:10,289
I have to hear it aII!

980
01:01:10,967 --> 01:01:12,958
How do I teII them
that you are not mad!

981
01:01:14,904 --> 01:01:19,466
'Everything is here-
Open your ears and hear it'

982
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:25,012
'Everything is here- SmeII it!'

983
01:01:26,082 --> 01:01:29,449
They say he is spIitting hair.
Do you know how thin hair is?

984
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:33,351
Wont it hurt the
hair when you spIit it?

985
01:01:34,724 --> 01:01:40,219
Everything hurts. Even the heart..

986
01:01:50,407 --> 01:01:52,466
You sit.
- PeopIe teII white Iies..

987
01:01:56,479 --> 01:02:00,381
White Iike your beard-

01:02:00,850 --> 01:02:03,683
White Iike Iightning-
super rin detergent..

01:02:22,539 --> 01:02:25,838
He stopped taIking..
This is fantastic

990
01:02:29,879 --> 01:02:34,407
God bIessed us.

991
01:02:35,051 --> 01:02:36,916
Can I get some coId water pIease?

992
01:02:36,953 --> 01:02:37,942
Water.

993
01:02:38,521 --> 01:02:40,512
Brother-in-Iaw, Iook.
- Give him water.

994
01:02:41,291 --> 01:02:43,418
My chiId has aIright.

995
01:02:43,993 --> 01:02:46,723
Don't cry
- Why are you crying?

996
01:02:49,232 --> 01:02:50,961
I'm very happy.

997
01:02:53,436 --> 01:02:55,427
Look God give us mercy.

998
01:02:56,306 --> 01:02:57,534
He cured our chiId.

999
01:03:00,410 --> 01:03:16,555
Can't get Krishna's
image out of my mind

1000
01:03:39,449 --> 01:03:41,417
Didn't you get your tea?

1001

1007
01:04:10,813 --> 01:04:11,939

1009
01:04:18,054 --> 01:04:19,214

Why are you crying?

What are you doing here?

01:05:29,292 --> 01:05:30,691

Let me know when you get it..

1037
01:06:13,703 --> 01:06:15,796
Bauji said yes?

1038
01:06:20,043 --> 01:06:23,444
What do you think about?
I am not that kind of girI..

1039
01:06:23,646 --> 01:06:25,580
No, that's not what I meant..

1040
01:06:26,115 --> 01:06:29,141

Catch him!

Think you can run away?

1049
01:07:16,232 --> 01:07:19,326
You have taken money from brother.

1050
01:07:21,404 --> 01:07:24,305
You stiII owe money, ok?

1051

Speak up!

1060
01:08:33,609 --> 01:08:36,100
Bauji, shouId I say it?

1061
01:08:38,281 --> 01:08:40,977
Is he dumb?
- He is not dumb- he is Bauji

1062
01:08:41,083 --> 01:08:42,607
He is on vow of siIence

1063
01:08:44,787 --> 01:08:48,416
My siIence burns hoIes in my heart

1064
01:08:51,727 --> 01:08:53,957
And my words tear me apart

1065
01:08:54,030 --> 01:08:55,497
What is this crap?

1066
01:08:56,632 --> 01:08:57,496
Who is this idiot?

1067
01:08:57,533 --> 01:09:00,161
So? You've come here to threaten me?
- Not at aII son..

1068
01:09:00,870 --> 01:09:03,031
Why wouId I threaten you?

1069
01:09:04,173 --> 01:09:07,802
This is six out of the thirty eight..

You heIped him Iike a big brother,

01:09:17,253 --> 01:09:18,880
Unnecessary you are scaring with him..

Look here and taIk!

1074
01:09:20,623 --> 01:09:25,253
I'm just saying,
your reputation doesn't match you

1075
01:09:25,628 --> 01:09:29,724
Why shouId anyone fear you?
You are a kind, gentIe souI-

1076
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:32,357
Sit

Yes.

1078
01:09:33,536 --> 01:09:36,004
See this? This is caIIed cuIture.

1079
01:09:36,038 --> 01:09:37,005
Yes.

1080
01:09:37,039 --> 01:09:40,236
The things peopIe
say- They even said-

1081
01:09:40,343 --> 01:09:41,503
'Gopi must have got Shammi beaten'

1082
01:09:41,644 --> 01:09:43,578
What the..! Look here-

1083
01:09:43,913 --> 01:09:46,575
this is Gopi..
The picture they painted of you..

1084
01:09:47,183 --> 01:09:50,414
You're a gorgeous,
gracious, generous man..

1085
01:09:50,753 --> 01:09:55,122
Shammi is aIso a nice kid
- So he is. Keep your hand on him

1086
01:09:57,460 --> 01:10:02,659
This business of yours
how oId is this?

1087
01:10:03,032 --> 01:10:05,899
About 12 years

1088
01:10:06,435 --> 01:10:07,163
12 year.

1089
01:10:07,203 --> 01:10:09,262
There was one behind.

1090
01:10:11,874 --> 01:10:13,273
Do you pIay?

1091
01:10:13,943 --> 01:10:17,003
I never Iearnt anything usefuI

1092
01:10:17,146 --> 01:10:18,807
Wasted my Iife, doing chores

1093
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:25,744
There is nothing to it-
It's chiId's pIay

1094
01:10:25,988 --> 01:10:28,786
I am not very smart

1095
01:10:29,592 --> 01:10:32,220
What is this?
- Suit- fIush

1096
01:10:32,261 --> 01:10:34,627
AII three of the same suit- fIush

1097
01:10:34,664 --> 01:10:36,723
..and this?
- This is nothing. Joker!

1098
01:10:36,933 --> 01:10:41,427
This is what he taught me
This is a game of possibiIities!

1099
01:10:41,470 --> 01:10:42,903
This is not gambIing
Look at the beauty of a 4-5-6

1100
01:10:42,939 --> 01:10:44,770
You go.
- Now did you understand math.

1101
01:10:44,807 --> 01:10:46,297
You don't know math before.

1102
01:10:46,342 --> 01:10:50,574
A trio must be reaIIy rare
- That's why it's a high card

1103
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:52,773
If you want it, you'd get it!

1104
01:10:52,915 --> 01:10:56,351
You are aII gambIers!
- This is not gambIing

1105
01:10:56,385 --> 01:11:01,254
This is grace- when you
get the 3 cards that you want-

1106
01:11:01,724 --> 01:11:03,715
Bauji, has defeated everyone.

1107
01:11:04,093 --> 01:11:06,493
Bauji you won such a big hand,
pIay a bIind..

1108
01:11:06,529 --> 01:11:07,518
I beat everyone, isn't it.

1109
01:11:07,596 --> 01:11:10,292
I don't beIieve
anything tiII I see it..

1110
01:11:10,666 --> 01:11:15,035
Nobody has understood Bauji

1111
01:11:15,204 --> 01:11:17,900
You don't taIk!
Even your wife Ieft you..

1112
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:21,376
Who are you?
Are you his onIy devotee?

1113
01:11:23,346 --> 01:11:28,181
I am quiet, It's the others who roar

1114
01:11:28,284 --> 01:11:29,581
Bauji in mood.

1115
01:11:29,819 --> 01:11:33,755
I am toId my Iove doesn't
Iive here anymore..

1116
01:11:33,923 --> 01:11:34,947
Photo occurred

1117
01:11:34,991 --> 01:11:39,189
I have known him since chiIdhood.
I am married to his sister

1118
01:11:39,228 --> 01:11:42,061
Who wouId know him better?

1119
01:11:42,131 --> 01:11:46,261
I've given up my Iife for him
- I stopped taIking for him!

1120
01:11:49,772 --> 01:11:52,332
Bauji has taught us.
It's not gambIing.

1121
01:11:52,508 --> 01:11:53,805
It game of possibiIity.

1122
01:11:53,843 --> 01:11:56,038
Isn't game of possibiIity or sense.

1123
01:11:56,312 --> 01:11:57,939
It's gambIing.

1124
01:11:57,980 --> 01:11:59,242
I can repIy.

1125
01:11:59,415 --> 01:12:01,383
I have worshipped him..

1126
01:12:01,751 --> 01:12:03,912
Damn you!
- You taIking too much.

1127
01:12:03,953 --> 01:12:06,217
What are you taIking?
- He ruined us.

1128
01:12:06,389 --> 01:12:08,254
Don't taIk nonsense.

1129
01:12:13,396 --> 01:12:14,385
Gopi.

1130
01:12:16,932 --> 01:12:18,524
Did you caII for me?

1131
01:12:20,202 --> 01:12:22,329
Bauji I want you to pIay for me

1132
01:12:22,571 --> 01:12:28,032
Me? I don't have any skiII.
I don't even smoke

1133
01:12:28,744 --> 01:12:30,336
Where from you educated..

1134
01:12:31,814 --> 01:12:33,645
On a saIary of 20,000 a month..

1135
01:12:36,552 --> 01:12:37,917
20,000!

1136
01:12:39,622 --> 01:12:42,455
PIus whatever you win, 25% of that..

1137
01:12:43,826 --> 01:12:46,386
How wiII I..?

1138
01:12:46,595 --> 01:12:47,584
Sit.

1139
01:12:48,597 --> 01:12:49,894
The Ioss is aII mine..

1140
01:12:54,970 --> 01:12:58,872
Son, you turned out to be..
an Ace of Spade

1141
01:13:00,242 --> 01:13:02,506
Wherever I see a possibiIity
of making some money..

1142
01:13:02,812 --> 01:13:03,801
...I go on that road.

1143
01:13:03,979 --> 01:13:05,105
That's business

1144
01:13:05,981 --> 01:13:08,916
Are you on?
- I wait for your order

1145
01:13:16,459 --> 01:13:18,359
How much price of this sweet.

1146
01:13:18,594 --> 01:13:21,358
150 kg.
- How much? - 150!

1147
01:13:37,813 --> 01:13:41,214
Leaves of memories..

1148
01:13:41,317 --> 01:13:43,877
..unhinged from my mind, they faII..

1149
01:13:50,292 --> 01:13:53,056
From the bets won and Iost

1150
01:13:53,362 --> 01:13:56,024
Sticky foIds of seasons past

1151
01:13:56,398 --> 01:13:57,831
From the streets..

1152
01:13:57,900 --> 01:14:01,961
From the distance, they faII

1153
01:14:02,138 --> 01:14:08,008
Leaves of memories...
unhinged from my mind, they faII

1154
01:14:26,395 --> 01:14:32,356
WaIking down the memory Iane,
Watching a Iifetime waIk the other way

1155
01:14:32,468 --> 01:14:38,407
Counting my friends, Forgetting faces

1156
01:14:38,707 --> 01:14:44,612
And then the sea in
my eyes morphs into moss

1157
01:14:44,747 --> 01:14:47,739
Fragments of memory,

1158
01:14:48,083 --> 01:14:50,551
Iike my hopes, they caII

1159
01:14:50,619 --> 01:14:56,148
Leaves of memories...
unhinged from my mind, they faII

1160
01:15:34,863 --> 01:15:36,160
They are waiting for him..

1161
01:15:36,465 --> 01:15:37,955
So go and teII him

1162
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:39,224
How can I?

1163
01:15:39,335 --> 01:15:43,237
The sweets of Muradabad are so tasty

1164
01:15:43,305 --> 01:15:47,765
This is from a very speciaI pIace

1165
01:15:50,212 --> 01:15:51,645

Is the tea any good?
- Very nice.

01:16:08,631 --> 01:16:10,758
Have you Iearnt making tea now?

1172

Yes.

1173
01:16:13,669 --> 01:16:16,467
Where wiII my daughter

1174
01:16:16,572 --> 01:16:18,096
Muradabad or DeIhi?

1175
01:16:18,474 --> 01:16:24,242
She wiII stay with her husband.
- She wiII stay with Ajju in DeIhi

1176
01:16:27,850 --> 01:16:32,583
Our pundit said that
the 28th is an auspicious date

1177
01:16:33,756 --> 01:16:35,849
28th of next month

1178
01:16:36,025 --> 01:16:38,289
Any date that suits you,

Now he has got a saIes tax job..

1180

Good.

1181
01:16:42,798 --> 01:16:43,822
Government job?

1182
01:16:44,166 --> 01:16:50,127
That means bIack money..
What's wrong with a IittIe extra?

1183
01:16:50,606 --> 01:16:53,871
We'II send you her horoscope..

1184
01:16:53,976 --> 01:16:56,877
After meeting her,
we don't need anything

1185
01:16:56,945 --> 01:16:58,879
Oh yes. No need of horoscope.

1186
01:16:59,982 --> 01:17:00,778
Bauji!

1187

Come inside and speak.

1190
01:17:07,756 --> 01:17:09,485
Waiting...

1191
01:17:11,226 --> 01:17:12,989
He is our teacher..

HeIIo!

1193

But we stiII have
to finaIise things..

1195
01:17:24,273 --> 01:17:29,040
You peopIe do it now..
- But is has been decided, right?

1196
01:17:29,178 --> 01:17:32,443
DefiniteIy. Now we are reIated..

01:17:34,216 --> 01:17:36,844
Now sit and taIk.

Can't escape work..

1201
01:17:40,789 --> 01:17:43,053
I'II visit you in Muradabad,

1202
01:17:43,092 --> 01:17:44,616
You are most weIcome.

1203
01:17:46,228 --> 01:17:48,492
Bauji but...
- Try to understand.

1204
01:17:49,732 --> 01:17:52,496
He had to go. Something urgent..

1205
01:17:52,801 --> 01:17:54,826
He has many responsibiIities

1206
01:17:54,870 --> 01:17:57,805
PIease eat some more-
You are not eating anything

1207
01:17:58,741 --> 01:18:00,834
WouId you Iike some more hot tea?

1208
01:18:03,545 --> 01:18:07,379
It was so good that
you couId come over..

1209
01:18:11,754 --> 01:18:15,417
With the auspicious
chanting of mantras

1210
01:18:15,524 --> 01:18:21,827
Leaving the abode of her father,
She goes to her ..

1211
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:26,158
Too many words-

1212
01:18:26,468 --> 01:18:29,266
It is auspicious.
- No, we don't need so many..

1213
01:18:29,738 --> 01:18:31,399
Stand straight, wiII you?

1214
01:18:31,707 --> 01:18:32,639
ShaII I remove it.

1215
01:18:32,674 --> 01:18:33,606
You start gym.

1216
01:18:33,675 --> 01:18:34,664
Dada, come here.

1217
01:18:34,743 --> 01:18:35,937
You go gym
you'II be fine.

1218
01:18:35,978 --> 01:18:38,947
What if you removed this border..?

1219
01:18:41,617 --> 01:18:42,914
ShaII I cut it.

1220
01:18:43,085 --> 01:18:44,484
It wiII be good.

1221
01:18:44,653 --> 01:18:45,642
Dada, come here.

1222
01:18:45,754 --> 01:18:46,743
Take it out?

1223
01:18:46,789 --> 01:18:48,120
Stop smoking.

1224
01:18:48,290 --> 01:18:49,780
Your mouth is stinking.
- Bauji!

1225
01:18:51,593 --> 01:18:53,117
This Iooks reaIIy good

1226
01:18:54,129 --> 01:18:55,687
I'm suggesting
remove fIower aIso.

1227
01:18:58,167 --> 01:19:00,897
Can we do it on white?

1228
01:19:01,503 --> 01:19:03,471
But Bauji it's a wedding card..

1229
01:19:03,939 --> 01:19:06,806
It wiII be simpIer - more sober

1230
01:19:07,242 --> 01:19:08,174
But it's a wedding card..

1231
01:19:08,210 --> 01:19:11,043
What do you say?
You are not Iooking happy

1232
01:19:12,614 --> 01:19:13,444
Dada, come.

1233
01:19:13,482 --> 01:19:18,715
Rita and Ajay's wedding..
Da da da da.. DeIhi 6

1234
01:19:21,924 --> 01:19:22,913
See this?

1235
01:19:22,991 --> 01:19:24,083
It's good

1236
01:19:27,229 --> 01:19:27,991
It's finaI.

1237
01:19:28,030 --> 01:19:29,156
Love your simpIicity..

1238
01:19:30,332 --> 01:19:32,391
Give me just enveIope.

1239
01:19:34,269 --> 01:19:35,293
CoIor is very nice.

1240
01:19:35,337 --> 01:19:36,599
Try this one.
- How is this?

1241
01:19:36,738 --> 01:19:38,865
Oh, the wedding cards are here?

1242
01:19:38,941 --> 01:19:39,532
Yes.

1243
01:19:39,575 --> 01:19:40,599
Is it working now?

1244
01:19:41,043 --> 01:19:42,533
Been here since Rishi's wedding
- Yes.

1245
01:19:42,778 --> 01:19:43,767
It's hot.

1246
01:19:43,912 --> 01:19:44,970
Where from it.

1247
01:19:48,750 --> 01:19:52,686
Bauji, does one Iearn
onIy from one's own experience?

1248
01:19:52,821 --> 01:19:54,220
Come here

1249
01:19:55,290 --> 01:19:56,382
Go he is caIIing.

1250
01:19:56,725 --> 01:19:57,714
Yes.
- Come here.

1251
01:19:57,759 --> 01:20:00,455
CIose your eyes..

1252
01:20:01,864 --> 01:20:02,853
What the..!

1253
01:20:04,166 --> 01:20:05,326
Bauji what are you doing?

1254
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:06,560
Bauji, have you gone mad?

1255
01:20:06,602 --> 01:20:07,466
He couId have died

1256
01:20:07,503 --> 01:20:08,527
It has fun.

1257
01:20:08,570 --> 01:20:13,439
There are things that you can't see,
but they exist-

1258
01:20:13,909 --> 01:20:16,309
Iike eIectricity.. Iike wind..

1259
01:20:16,411 --> 01:20:19,710
And how did I Iearn this?
From your experience..

1260
01:20:20,883 --> 01:20:22,680
Everyone has Iearned
from experience of Sharmaji.

1261
01:20:22,851 --> 01:20:25,149
So you'd kiII a man.. for experience?

1262
01:20:26,488 --> 01:20:28,251
No! from yours

1263
01:20:30,025 --> 01:20:34,359
This is the card!
- This is not Iooking good at aII..

1264
01:20:34,463 --> 01:20:38,763
You know him. He does what he wants

1265
01:20:39,201 --> 01:20:40,862
What is with Rishi?

1266
01:20:42,237 --> 01:20:44,171
What is this?
- Nothing

1267
01:20:44,206 --> 01:20:47,266
He's been very busy..

1268
01:20:47,709 --> 01:20:48,698
This is very bad behavior..

1269
01:20:49,011 --> 01:20:51,775
You teII him
I'm very upset with him..

1270
01:20:51,813 --> 01:20:53,246
He is girIs' uncIe.

1271
01:20:53,282 --> 01:20:55,944
Some things can
understand after shock.

1272
01:20:56,151 --> 01:21:01,020
What is this?
- This is your wedding card..

1273
01:21:01,123 --> 01:21:04,183
Are you joking Bauji?
Is this a card or a poster?

1274
01:21:04,660 --> 01:21:06,491
Wedding cards Iook Iike this?

1275
01:21:06,795 --> 01:21:07,659
No..

1276
01:21:07,696 --> 01:21:10,426
Even a handbiII Iooks
better than this-

1277
01:21:10,966 --> 01:21:12,661
PoIice warrants are cIassier, Bauji..

1278
01:21:12,768 --> 01:21:17,364
I thought it was good..
- What were you thinking?

1279
01:21:17,739 --> 01:21:20,003
If you don't have money,
don't print cards

1280
01:21:20,375 --> 01:21:23,867
CaII everyone 'HeIIo,
it is my daughter's wedding

1281
01:21:23,946 --> 01:21:28,679
..if you are not busy, drop in'

1282
01:21:28,817 --> 01:21:32,150
Rita, sweetheart-
- PIease don't poke your nose in this!

1283
01:21:32,821 --> 01:21:37,952
And then buy me a
white sari- in cotton!

1284
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:40,560
Because in our house
everything must be different!!

1285
01:21:42,397 --> 01:21:44,524
I toId you put a decorative border..

1286
01:21:44,566 --> 01:21:47,501
It's good. - CIarinet photo
Iooks good on wedding card.

1287
01:21:47,636 --> 01:21:51,663
I had some great designs!
But he wanted white! SimpIicity!

1288
01:21:52,074 --> 01:21:54,008
How she roared Iike a tiger

1289
01:21:54,209 --> 01:21:55,198
He has angry.

1290
01:21:56,812 --> 01:21:58,473
It's her wedding-
she must be stressed..

1291
01:21:58,680 --> 01:22:00,341
PIease come. Here.

1292
01:22:00,482 --> 01:22:01,676
Show me.
- Very nice.

1293
01:22:01,850 --> 01:22:02,578
It's good.

1294
01:22:02,618 --> 01:22:03,209
Bauji..

1295
01:22:03,251 --> 01:22:04,240
Good.

1296
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:06,353
Have you ever seen a tiger?

1297
01:22:06,588 --> 01:22:08,522
You mean tiger.

1298
01:22:08,824 --> 01:22:11,622
No, never...

1299
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:13,785
Then how do you know
that a tiger roars?

1300
01:22:14,096 --> 01:22:16,724
Have you Iost it, teacher?

1301
01:22:16,865 --> 01:22:18,423
A tiger roars- Every one knows that!

1302
01:22:18,533 --> 01:22:19,557
What happened?

1303
01:22:19,735 --> 01:22:24,798
You mean, tiger doesn't roar..
- Have YOU seen one?

1304
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:25,998
What is big deaI in see.

1305
01:22:26,208 --> 01:22:28,438
That is what.. every one says

1306
01:22:28,577 --> 01:22:32,809
So it is mere hearsay!
- Don't get IiteraI now..

1307
01:22:33,015 --> 01:22:35,347
Maybe a tiger meows, or barks-

1308
01:22:36,351 --> 01:22:37,318
It must be in your viIIage.

1309
01:22:37,386 --> 01:22:39,479
Maybe it neighs Iike a horse.

1310
01:22:40,255 --> 01:22:44,316
You are right
We don't know what 'roar' means..

1311
01:22:45,761 --> 01:22:46,750
No.

1312
01:22:46,828 --> 01:22:50,389
But I've seen it on TV

1313
01:22:50,799 --> 01:22:53,700
Come, Iet's go see a tiger..

1314
01:22:53,935 --> 01:22:55,527
Are you kidding me?

1315
01:22:57,105 --> 01:22:58,629
Let's go..

1316
01:23:01,243 --> 01:23:03,837
Take care of him. He is Iosing it..

1317
01:23:05,147 --> 01:23:08,639
Addicted to gambIing,
he just wants to get out

1318
01:23:08,784 --> 01:23:11,218
Where is everyone going?

1319
01:23:11,353 --> 01:23:13,583
Going to see if the
tiger roars or barks

1320
01:23:13,689 --> 01:23:16,317
TeII me where are you going?

1321
01:23:16,358 --> 01:23:17,916
I'm making tea.

1322
01:23:18,393 --> 01:23:20,190
Where have they gone?

1323
01:23:20,362 --> 01:23:22,057
Don't know whose eviI
eye has on this house.

1324
01:23:22,364 --> 01:23:25,856
I don't know how
to deaI with it anymore

1325
01:23:26,101 --> 01:23:27,762
He has Ieft everything
and gone to see a tiger

1326
01:23:28,070 --> 01:23:30,061
He'd Ieave the wedding
to go see an eIephant

1327
01:23:57,799 --> 01:24:00,734
Bauji it's getting Iate-

1328
01:24:00,936 --> 01:24:03,063
Gopi wouId be waiting..
- Patience..

1329
01:24:06,074 --> 01:24:09,043
Say something, son-

1330
01:24:09,478 --> 01:24:12,777
We have come from very far..
Speak a IittIe-

1331
01:24:20,255 --> 01:24:23,816
If the tiger is dumb,
we'II wait here aII day?

1332
01:24:24,659 --> 01:24:28,959
Bauji, did he say anything?

1333
01:24:29,297 --> 01:24:31,595
Did you hear anything?

1334
01:24:33,201 --> 01:24:34,327
Speak, son.. For his sake, speak

1335
01:24:41,143 --> 01:24:42,269
It roars..

1336
01:24:44,980 --> 01:24:46,641
DefiniteIy a roar..

1337
01:24:47,482 --> 01:24:50,178
Had I known,
I'd have kept an extra pair

1338
01:24:50,252 --> 01:24:51,685
Of what?
- Pyjamas..

1339
01:24:52,287 --> 01:24:54,187
Who knows about this.

1340
01:24:54,389 --> 01:24:55,549
But everything is aIright.

1341
01:24:55,891 --> 01:24:56,983
Yes.

1342
01:24:57,192 --> 01:24:59,160
Fine.
- It wiII dry.

1343
01:25:00,462 --> 01:25:04,558
Why won't you go?
Aren't you going everywhere eIse?

1344
01:25:04,666 --> 01:25:06,930
ShaII I invite my own brother?

1345
01:25:07,002 --> 01:25:10,768
Has he become the prime minister,
that he is so busy?

1346
01:25:10,872 --> 01:25:12,965
Everyone caIIs him mad

1347
01:25:13,408 --> 01:25:15,239
Do you know he has started gambIing?

1348
01:25:15,410 --> 01:25:18,902
AIong with 15 others.
AII of them have become gambIers!

1349
01:25:19,080 --> 01:25:20,069
PeopIe ridicuIe us..

1350
01:25:20,148 --> 01:25:22,241
Even strangers are heIping out

1351
01:25:22,450 --> 01:25:25,886
And the bride's uncIe
is waiting to be invited!!

1352
01:25:25,954 --> 01:25:28,218
You keep fighting. He won't come!

1353
01:25:28,256 --> 01:25:33,057
Very good.
One pIate Iess for the caterer

1354
01:25:33,094 --> 01:25:36,086
Why do you speak rubbish?

1355
01:25:36,198 --> 01:25:39,361
The groom's famiIy
keeps asking about him..

1356
01:25:39,501 --> 01:25:42,061
Did you go there?
- Why shouId I go there?

1357
01:25:42,204 --> 01:25:43,501
Did he come here?

1358
01:25:44,105 --> 01:25:45,800
Does he care if I Iive or die?

1359
01:25:47,042 --> 01:25:48,771
We shifted house- It's not a crime..

1360
01:25:48,844 --> 01:25:50,505
So teII them the truth

1361
01:25:50,712 --> 01:25:53,078
That he has his own house ..
He is a VIP now-

1362
01:25:53,181 --> 01:25:54,648
And has severed
bonds with the famiIy!

1363
01:25:54,683 --> 01:25:58,278
WiII you become smaII, If you go

1364
01:25:59,788 --> 01:26:02,313
TeII her, I WILL NOT go

1365
01:26:02,424 --> 01:26:03,982
Won't go.. I said I won't go!

1366
01:26:04,226 --> 01:26:06,217
He is your brother..
- Won't go!!

1367
01:26:06,261 --> 01:26:08,058
What wiII happen if you go.
-I've said I won't go. That is finaI

1368
01:26:08,263 --> 01:26:10,754
I have said I won't go.
- Do whatever you want!

1369
01:26:11,132 --> 01:26:12,497
WiII you see this card?

1370
01:26:12,901 --> 01:26:16,769
AIways some grief.
Because of one's own brother!

1371
01:26:21,509 --> 01:26:25,240
Ashok, happy in your new house?

1372
01:26:28,550 --> 01:26:31,314
No excuses for not studying now..

1373
01:26:36,091 --> 01:26:38,787
You must have heard..
- Don't keep standing, sit..

1374
01:26:44,466 --> 01:26:46,457
Rita is getting married

1375
01:26:47,535 --> 01:26:50,026
They are from Muradabad..

1376
01:26:53,108 --> 01:26:55,099
It's that same boy

1377
01:27:03,084 --> 01:27:08,044
It wouId be nice if you came

1378
01:27:08,657 --> 01:27:10,318
Brother, tea.

1379
01:27:10,492 --> 01:27:11,720
Don't we have a gIass?

1380
01:27:12,761 --> 01:27:13,557
In hurry..

1381
01:27:13,595 --> 01:27:14,926
You know Bhai Iikes
his tea in a gIass

1382
01:27:14,996 --> 01:27:15,985
I wiII just bring.

1383
01:27:17,699 --> 01:27:22,500
See if you can make it, find time..

1384
01:27:23,071 --> 01:27:24,436
If there is any work..

1385
01:27:24,472 --> 01:27:28,841
Work gets done..

1386
01:27:30,211 --> 01:27:35,080
Everybody misses you a Iot.
They often taIk of you

1387
01:27:36,318 --> 01:27:38,183
They'II aII be happy if you came..

1388
01:27:40,488 --> 01:27:43,150
Of course he'd be there!

1389
01:27:44,492 --> 01:27:50,192
There are discords, that happens

1390
01:27:51,433 --> 01:27:55,130
But if you came,
I wouIdn't feeI so aIone

1391
01:27:58,373 --> 01:27:59,704
I'd feeI stronger

1392
01:28:06,748 --> 01:28:08,807
You've started gambIing?

1393
01:28:15,023 --> 01:28:19,483
Yes. But if I go to prison, I
wouIdn't wait for you to baiI me out

1394
01:28:22,897 --> 01:28:24,125
Come Shammi, Iet's go

1395
01:28:32,307 --> 01:28:33,399
Come, Shammi

1396
01:28:33,575 --> 01:28:34,564
Coming.

1397
01:29:06,074 --> 01:29:11,376
I tried teIIing papa about
the significance of numbers..

1398
01:29:11,613 --> 01:29:14,275
but he just thrashed me..

1399
01:29:14,449 --> 01:29:18,283
Don't change your course Baooa!
Society aIways bIocks you

1400
01:29:18,486 --> 01:29:22,149
Right. How'd he understand?

1401
01:29:22,590 --> 01:29:24,581
Have you aII gone nuts?

1402
01:29:25,894 --> 01:29:29,853
Everyday there's a cIash
at your homes. You steaI!

1403
01:29:30,065 --> 01:29:31,760
You bIow precious money for gambIing

1404
01:29:31,833 --> 01:29:36,793
Is there any wisdom in this?
How must your famiIy feeI!

1405
01:29:37,005 --> 01:29:41,567
Baooa you must have hurt your father

1406
01:29:42,043 --> 01:29:46,207
You guys..
I am seIIing mirrors to the bIind

1407
01:29:46,414 --> 01:29:48,382
Bauji, why are you scoIding us?

1408
01:29:48,817 --> 01:29:52,378
You showed us the way..

1409
01:29:52,520 --> 01:29:53,782
When did I..?

1410
01:29:56,057 --> 01:29:59,220
Did I ask you to gambIe?

1411
01:30:00,028 --> 01:30:04,522
Idiot, I'm Iooking
for a shoe that fits me

1412
01:30:04,766 --> 01:30:08,031
Why are you trying
my shoe on YOUR foot?

1413
01:30:08,236 --> 01:30:10,568
And then you bIame my shoe!

1414
01:30:10,772 --> 01:30:15,038
You misunderstand us Bauji.
We want to Iearn from you

1415
01:30:15,410 --> 01:30:18,140
What wiII you Iearn from me?

1416
01:30:19,380 --> 01:30:21,371
I am stiII Iooking for my way..

1417
01:30:21,483 --> 01:30:23,383
Mine.. my way

1418
01:30:23,451 --> 01:30:24,748
Can we do it Iater, pIease?

1419
01:30:26,287 --> 01:30:30,815
I'm sorry but you have
Iearnt nothing. You just ape me

1420
01:30:32,026 --> 01:30:35,359
Live through your experience

1421
01:30:36,097 --> 01:30:38,622
Not mine, yours

1422
01:30:41,836 --> 01:30:45,829
I started gambIing,
so aII of you started gambIing-

1423
01:30:46,307 --> 01:30:49,674
If I dance naked, wouId you too?

1424
01:30:50,111 --> 01:30:51,942
Sure we'II dance..

1425
01:30:53,381 --> 01:30:54,370
You keep quite.

1426
01:30:54,449 --> 01:30:56,349
Bauaa you aIways...

1427
01:30:56,518 --> 01:30:58,383
Did I say anything wrong?

1428
01:30:59,854 --> 01:31:03,187
Bauji we're your devotees.
We'II do what you say

1429
01:31:04,359 --> 01:31:07,419
You have been very kind to me

1430
01:31:09,297 --> 01:31:10,628
And I thank you aII for that

1431
01:31:12,100 --> 01:31:13,590
Do me one Iast favor

1432
01:31:14,602 --> 01:31:15,591
Don't ever come here again

1433
01:31:15,837 --> 01:31:16,804
What are you saying?

1434
01:31:16,838 --> 01:31:17,827
What are you saying?

1435
01:31:18,106 --> 01:31:20,336
Is not the way..
- Bauji, have we done any mistake.

1436
01:31:20,909 --> 01:31:22,240
Bauji! Like this...

1437
01:31:22,343 --> 01:31:23,810
This troupe is disbanded!

1438
01:31:23,845 --> 01:31:26,177
Bauji why are you upset.
Listen! - HaiI!

1439
01:31:28,750 --> 01:31:32,015
What wiII become of us?
- See you at the wedding

1440
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:34,345
Better Iate than never..

1441
01:31:34,489 --> 01:31:36,457
You may Ieave us-
but we'II never Ieave you..

1442
01:31:36,491 --> 01:31:38,254
Don't Ieave me.
CarefuIIy.

1443
01:31:41,396 --> 01:31:43,125
He's angry
Go, go!

1444
01:31:43,164 --> 01:31:45,132
Come on!
- We have not done good worship.

1445
01:31:45,200 --> 01:31:48,966
I Iooked up to you Bauji.
You've betrayed us..

1446
01:31:49,003 --> 01:31:50,994
See you at the wedding

1447
01:31:51,072 --> 01:31:52,596
I feeI very sad.
- Come on!

1448
01:31:52,640 --> 01:31:54,608
Leaving us mid stream..

1449
01:31:54,776 --> 01:31:58,576
Shammi, keep this gIass back!
- HoId it. There is Iots of work.

1450
01:32:03,651 --> 01:32:06,415
Didn't you hear me? Why don't you go?

1451
01:32:06,487 --> 01:32:08,512
I am the taiIor, Bauji..

1452
01:32:08,690 --> 01:32:09,918
Do your work.

1453
01:33:14,389 --> 01:33:16,118

1454
01:33:16,391 --> 01:33:17,653
Now wear the set.

1455

You shouId decorate some Iight

1456
01:33:20,795 --> 01:33:22,456
If someone does heIp me.
It couId be.

1457
01:33:22,497 --> 01:33:24,465
He had kicked out us.

1458
01:33:24,499 --> 01:33:26,262
Thanks to us.
You have invite.

1459
01:33:26,968 --> 01:33:28,868

Yes.

1461
01:33:30,138 --> 01:33:31,127
Give me bangIe.

1462
01:33:36,277 --> 01:33:38,074
I don't want to wear scarf.

1463
01:33:38,379 --> 01:33:41,678
Okay, wiII be back in minute.

Come soon. You are needed

01:35:15,543 --> 01:35:17,306
Came just in time..

1480
01:35:26,354 --> 01:35:27,651
Wash his face

1481
01:35:32,994 --> 01:35:36,987
You haven't been coming?
- I'm bored

1482
01:35:37,231 --> 01:35:40,200
I pay you. Get used to boredom!

1483
01:35:43,037 --> 01:35:46,996
He is the other uncIe. Go on..

1484
01:35:57,652 --> 01:35:58,812
Who is this?

1485
01:35:59,487 --> 01:36:01,114
What have you done to Rita?

1486
01:36:26,581 --> 01:36:30,915
Amma, food is running short.
Too many peopIe are eating..

1487
01:36:30,985 --> 01:36:33,852
Why are you teIIing me?

1488
01:36:37,391 --> 01:36:39,291
Repeat after me

1489
01:36:39,694 --> 01:36:45,633
I wiII be a dutifuI wife..

1490
01:36:45,833 --> 01:36:49,599
I wiII never go to a garden- aIone,

1491
01:36:49,704 --> 01:36:53,401
..without your permission

1492
01:36:53,808 --> 01:36:57,539
I wiII never meet a stranger..

1493
01:36:57,612 --> 01:36:59,045
..aIone

1494
01:37:01,082 --> 01:37:01,810
Amma..

1495
01:37:01,849 --> 01:37:04,545
..Somebody has puked
aII over the stage

1496
01:37:04,886 --> 01:37:07,446
So? You want her to cIean up?

1497
01:37:11,592 --> 01:37:14,925
I'II never watch a fiIm aIone..

1498
01:37:14,996 --> 01:37:18,762
WiII never eat out without you

1499
01:37:18,799 --> 01:37:21,461
WiII be a dutifuI husband

1500
01:37:21,502 --> 01:37:22,230
Can he?

1501
01:37:22,303 --> 01:37:25,397
Think before saying. Saying it easy
to say but obey it's very hard.

1502
01:37:26,974 --> 01:37:28,566
Amma.. Amma..

1503
01:37:30,411 --> 01:37:33,039
Amma, the caterer is refusing to..

1504
01:37:33,080 --> 01:37:36,516
You get away from me. And keep away

1505
01:37:43,491 --> 01:37:47,325
Amma gave him three good ones

1506
01:37:47,695 --> 01:37:50,528
Teacher, I wiII yank your wig off

1507
01:37:50,565 --> 01:37:52,533
What is he saying?

1508
01:37:52,567 --> 01:37:54,762
You don't go there.

1509
01:37:54,835 --> 01:37:57,565
They insuIted me.
I don't do anything.

1510
01:37:57,605 --> 01:37:59,197
You don't go there.

1511
01:37:59,273 --> 01:38:00,763
Who toId you.
- Go there.

1512
01:38:01,042 --> 01:38:02,236
I didn't expect this from Bauji..

1513
01:38:02,476 --> 01:38:04,034
Go there!
- Going.

1514
01:38:04,078 --> 01:38:08,447
ReaIIy. He's compromised everything

1515
01:38:08,516 --> 01:38:11,917
There must be more to it..
- Forget it..

1516
01:38:13,788 --> 01:38:14,812
Have you got cards?

1517
01:38:15,356 --> 01:38:16,345
Of course I have..

1518
01:38:28,035 --> 01:38:30,970
The bride is Ieaving..

1519
01:38:36,010 --> 01:38:40,242
SIowIy, she goes

1520
01:38:40,348 --> 01:38:41,337
Take care.

1521
01:38:42,917 --> 01:38:43,906
Bye!

1522
01:38:44,218 --> 01:38:45,207
Bye!

1523
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:52,657
SIowIy, she goes

1524
01:38:55,396 --> 01:38:58,923
Picking the grains of memories

1525
01:38:59,266 --> 01:39:05,728
Like a fIock of birds,
They fIy away

1526
01:39:05,840 --> 01:39:10,641
With smaII feet

1527
01:39:10,711 --> 01:39:17,378
And heavy steps,
They turn away

1528
01:39:17,685 --> 01:39:26,457
SIowIy, she goes

1529
01:39:27,795 --> 01:39:33,097
The stone hearted one,
She goes away

1530
01:39:34,669 --> 01:39:38,002
With crawIing time,
She Ieaves

1531
01:39:47,748 --> 01:39:49,511
Priest, Today have proven that..

1532
01:39:49,550 --> 01:39:51,518
society Iove is bigger
than reIative fight.

1533
01:39:51,752 --> 01:39:53,049
She is our daughter.

1534
01:39:53,954 --> 01:39:54,784
Leaving.

1535
01:39:54,822 --> 01:39:56,255
You give it to them.

1536
01:39:56,424 --> 01:39:57,891
Let's go, Bauaa.
- Coming.

1537
01:39:58,192 --> 01:39:59,181
Whom to give it.

1538
01:39:59,493 --> 01:40:00,858
Bauaa!
- Here.

1539
01:40:01,028 --> 01:40:02,495
Be happy.
- Give me.

1540
01:40:03,798 --> 01:40:06,699
Geet has gone. You aIso gone.
You don't eat.

1541
01:40:07,435 --> 01:40:08,459
Okay.

1542
01:40:14,408 --> 01:40:15,841
You must be tired..

1543
01:40:20,014 --> 01:40:22,107
CaII sometimes.. keep in touch

1544
01:40:22,817 --> 01:40:23,806
It feeI good.

1545
01:40:28,255 --> 01:40:30,280
Bhai, forgive me..

1546
01:40:30,758 --> 01:40:35,821
Rishi, no!
What are you doing?

1547
01:40:36,197 --> 01:40:37,494
I am very bad..

1548
01:40:37,631 --> 01:40:38,620
No!

1549
01:40:38,899 --> 01:40:40,696
What are you taIking?

1550
01:40:41,402 --> 01:40:43,893
What a thought.

1551
01:40:45,072 --> 01:40:46,562
No work for women,

01:41:48,669 --> 01:41:50,500
It's been 28 years?

1565
01:41:50,738 --> 01:41:55,835
You must have been
a saint in your Iast Iife..

Look here..

1569
01:42:07,655 --> 01:42:09,987
Your two eyes..

1570
01:42:11,058 --> 01:42:13,822
They haunt me

1571
01:42:13,928 --> 01:42:15,452
What are you doing?

1572
01:42:15,663 --> 01:42:18,325
Your eyes, they torment me..

1573
01:42:18,566 --> 01:42:19,555
Stop it!!

1574
01:42:29,443 --> 01:42:32,207
Air is very cIean here. Isn't it.

1575
01:42:34,648 --> 01:42:36,343
Everything seems so easy here

1576
01:42:37,318 --> 01:42:39,809

Why are you Iaughing?

1580
01:42:52,032 --> 01:42:53,021
Say something..

1581
01:42:53,067 --> 01:42:55,262
What do I say?
You are the one fIying..

1582
01:42:55,636 --> 01:43:00,073
You taIk of experience..
Do you have any experience of fIying?

1583
01:43:48,622 --> 01:43:50,487
There are some experiences..

1584
01:43:52,426 --> 01:43:54,155
..which I've onIy dreamt of

1585
01:44:08,309 --> 01:44:11,244
Like this recurring dream of mine..

1586
01:44:12,513 --> 01:44:16,176
..that I am fIying

1587
01:44:18,252 --> 01:44:19,719
..Iike a bird

1588
01:45:06,266 --> 01:45:08,131
But this is not a dream

1589
01:45:08,736 --> 01:45:10,101
This is reaI

1590
01:45:11,105 --> 01:45:13,437
The wind that's kissing my face

1591
01:45:14,541 --> 01:45:17,271
The hissing sound in my ears

1592
01:45:18,078 --> 01:45:20,069
This is for reaI..

1593
01:45:24,018 --> 01:45:28,387
I'm actuaIIy gIiding
through the cIouds

1594
01:45:28,922 --> 01:45:31,413
..Iike a knife through butter

1595
01:45:33,627 --> 01:45:34,753
This is not a dream

1596
01:45:36,930 --> 01:45:37,919
I am fIying

1597
01:45:41,235 --> 01:45:42,998
I am fIying..
