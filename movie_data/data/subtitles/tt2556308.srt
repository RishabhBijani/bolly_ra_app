00:12:40,607 --> 00:12:44,600
Sir, your daughter

But, our tastes
seem different...

59
00:12:49,552 --> 00:12:52,385
l don't know if we
will be a good match...

60
00:12:53,923 --> 00:12:57,620
But, you will surely find a
better Groom for your daughter...

61
00:12:57,930 --> 00:12:59,192

62
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,991
He is not going to get
married in this lifetime!!

63
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,730
Give me one reason for
not liking this girl!

64
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,701
l have three reasons!

65
00:13:12,105 --> 00:13:15,040
That girl has hair that is
a meter and a half long!

66
00:13:17,078 --> 00:13:20,878
take ages to set
their hair before going out for party

67
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,020
Did l ask for this? Did l?

68
00:13:23,423 --> 00:13:25,823
Did l ask you to
get me married now?

69
00:13:26,826 --> 00:13:28,487
On top of that,
she is shy.

70
00:13:35,302 --> 00:13:37,395
Look at her,
slapping her own Father...

71
00:13:38,305 --> 00:13:39,203
Well!

72
00:13:39,573 --> 00:13:41,006
You should have disciplined
her while she was young.

73
00:13:41,341 --> 00:13:42,743
You were the one who played
with her...

74
00:13:42,743 --> 00:13:44,267
...asking her to ''Hit Daddy''

75
00:13:44,578 --> 00:13:46,569
l thought she would be
a stylish girl,

76
00:14:02,727 --> 00:14:03,989
Why do you need
so much money?

77
00:14:10,463 --> 00:14:10,929

78
00:14:12,963 --> 00:14:13,097

Virat every time you come here for holiday

86
00:15:05,002 --> 00:15:06,629
You will interfere
in everything l do.

87
00:15:06,871 --> 00:15:08,168
Just when l am about to get
promoted from...

88
00:15:08,239 --> 00:15:10,002
...being a Sub lnspector (Sl)
to an lnspector,

89
00:15:10,207 --> 00:15:11,606

Don't ask me

101
00:17:21,637 --> 00:17:23,637
She is a shy girl

102
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:12,125
I don't like this girl?

103
00:18:35,206 --> 00:18:35,206
You need a girl like her

104
00:23:20,776 --> 00:23:24,234
That is just not possible!!!!
He has gone mad!

105
00:23:24,513 --> 00:23:26,674
He said he didn't like her,
but now he says he likes her.

106
00:23:26,949 --> 00:23:28,644
He's got hold of a lame
Police dog from somewhere..

107
00:23:29,718 --> 00:23:31,583
...and is trying to please me
saying it's my birthday gift!

108
00:23:32,021 --> 00:23:33,852
ls she a Girl or a dish
that you can re-order?

109
00:23:34,456 --> 00:23:36,321
lf we listen to him,
we'll turn crazy!

110
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:37,048
Hey!Tell them!

111

We can't talk to them again!

What is it?
ls he kidding?

113
00:23:52,268 --> 00:23:54,327
He said he didn't like me then.
But, now he likes me!

114
00:23:55,637 --> 00:23:58,800
After the wedding, he might
not like me again. ls that ok?

115
00:24:23,964 --> 00:24:25,158
l don't need to do all that.

116
00:24:36,665 --> 00:24:38,064
Virat don't get married

117
00:24:47,518 --> 00:24:49,518
She is the boxer

118
00:24:52,473 --> 00:24:53,770
Should we try saying ''Hi''.?

119
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,000
He is the guy l said ''No'' to.

120
00:25:43,418 --> 00:25:45,409
Hey! Get down!!
Come on, get down!

121

124
00:25:53,094 --> 00:25:53,958
Me.?

125
00:25:57,432 --> 00:25:59,366
Ya. l only kissed the Mirror.

126
00:25:59,734 --> 00:26:00,701
This is my Mirror.

127
00:26:00,902 --> 00:26:02,096
l will do whatever
l like with it.

128
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:04,861
The Mirror is yours, but
the reflection in it was mine.

129
00:26:05,206 --> 00:26:06,230
That belongs
to the Government.

130
00:26:07,676 --> 00:26:11,009
l will kiss my Mirror,
cajole it, break it.

131
00:26:11,613 --> 00:26:12,443
That is up to me.

132
00:26:12,547 --> 00:26:14,708
Why should you break it?
l'll break it myself!

133
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:17,018
No violence, please.
This is a public Road.

134
00:26:17,018 --> 00:26:18,713
What cheek you have
to kiss on the Road?

135
00:26:18,887 --> 00:26:19,376
What kind of
a Policeman are you?

136
00:26:19,487 --> 00:26:20,886
You are sitting there like
a sack of Potatoes!

137

You can enquire about
''Boxer Saiba

She has my bike key's

142
00:26:55,585 --> 00:26:58,213
Had you said you liked her
at the first instant,

143
00:26:58,655 --> 00:27:00,179
my bike mirror
would have been saved.

144

145
00:27:02,158 --> 00:27:05,423
She flicked the Bike keys
as she was talking to us!

146
00:27:05,695 --> 00:27:07,925
She wasn't talking,
she was chiding!

147
00:27:08,498 --> 00:27:10,728
What did my Department Bike

...they are treating him
at the Hospital.

171
00:31:52,303 --> 00:31:54,601
Look at him making speeches
with bated breath,

172
00:31:54,939 --> 00:31:56,406
...as though he caught him.

173
00:31:56,541 --> 00:31:57,906

00:31:58,676 --> 00:31:59,836
You dragged me

175
00:32:00,211 --> 00:32:04,545
Had l appeared on Television,
my Mother-ln-Law would be shaken.

176
00:32:04,949 --> 00:32:06,940
Things would have been
different at home.

an lnspector!

178
00:32:15,026 --> 00:32:16,960
The motive ofTerrorists could
not have been to plant...

179
00:32:17,028 --> 00:32:18,518
...a bomb in the
State Transport Bus,

180
00:32:19,097 --> 00:32:23,466
but could have gone off unexpectedly,
while in transit to another place.

181
00:32:23,801 --> 00:32:25,530
The Minister of Home Affairs
has expressed...

182
00:32:25,703 --> 00:32:27,500
...concern over the number of
terrorist like,

183
00:32:27,805 --> 00:32:33,937
Ajmal Lateef and their motives

184
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:02,404
l've been waiting for you.
-Why?

185
00:34:02,505 --> 00:34:03,403
Go in, l'll tell you.

186
00:34:21,224 --> 00:34:22,452
What is it?
At this time

187
00:34:22,558 --> 00:34:25,721
They work with me.
They're off duty now.

188
00:34:26,229 --> 00:34:28,254
They will stay on guard here,
just for tonight.

189
00:34:28,498 --> 00:34:31,296
Leave  with
your family tomorrow morning.

190
00:34:33,269 --> 00:34:34,293
Why are you
doing all this?

191
00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:35,960
He has escaped
from the Hospital.

192
00:34:38,207 --> 00:34:39,071
What?

193
00:34:39,208 --> 00:34:41,608
He has killed a Doctor
and two Police Officers.

194
00:34:42,812 --> 00:34:43,744
How?

195
00:34:44,013 --> 00:34:44,843
l don't know.

196
00:34:45,014 --> 00:34:46,208
Fine, you go ahead.

197
00:34:46,449 --> 00:34:47,746
lt was you who caught him;

198
00:34:47,884 --> 00:34:49,715
l suspect he might
come looking for you.

199
00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:50,943
They are here anyway.

200
00:34:51,154 --> 00:34:52,382
Both of you go
to the rear side.

201
00:34:52,788 --> 00:34:53,812
l'll get going.

202
00:36:18,465 --> 00:36:20,465
So many policemen today

203
00:38:14,765 --> 00:38:18,861
What did those innocent kids
in the Bus do to you?

204
00:38:40,012 --> 00:38:41,447
Do you know why l
chopped off your finger...

205
00:38:41,447 --> 00:38:42,937
...without asking you anything?

206
00:38:43,916 --> 00:38:45,747
l am going to ask you
a question now.

207
00:38:46,185 --> 00:38:48,517
lf you don't answer it, you should
know what could happen to you.

208
00:38:59,932 --> 00:39:01,058
One question.

209
00:39:02,301 --> 00:39:04,826
Just one second to give me
an answer,

210
00:39:05,471 --> 00:39:09,134
else, the other finger
will go as well.

211
00:39:28,293 --> 00:39:30,420
That's all. So simple!

212
00:39:46,745 --> 00:39:48,303
Who is it?
- lt's me!

213
00:39:53,585 --> 00:39:54,552
Who is it?

214
00:39:55,487 --> 00:39:56,784
What are you doing here
at this time?

215
00:39:57,423 --> 00:39:59,789
Who is it?
- l am coming.

216
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:04,192
l am asking you.
What are you doing here?

217
00:40:04,496 --> 00:40:05,758
l need to talk to you.

218
00:40:06,565 --> 00:40:07,759
Can you come up
to the Terrace?

219
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:10,065
What do you want
at this hour?

220
00:40:10,235 --> 00:40:11,259
We can talk in the morning.

221
00:40:25,484 --> 00:40:27,782
The guy you helped escape is
now at my house as my guest.

222
00:40:29,922 --> 00:40:31,287
Sorry, l didn't tell you
who l am.

223
00:40:33,666 --> 00:40:36,396
One of the specialists at
the Defense lntelligence Agency.

224
00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:38,203
A Secret Agent in the Army.

225
00:40:40,373 --> 00:40:43,035
People who work with me.

226
00:40:43,743 --> 00:40:44,641
My friends.

227
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:47,143
Even my family
doesn't know this.

228
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:51,845
Are you wondering why
l am telling you this?

229
00:40:53,487 --> 00:40:55,045
Because, you are not going
to be alive any more.

230
00:40:58,792 --> 00:41:01,454
While we are at the Camp,
the other Country firing at us

231
00:41:01,661 --> 00:41:05,222
and us firing in return
happens often.

232
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,692
One day, at our Camp,
a boy called ashraf,

233
00:41:11,037 --> 00:41:15,872
a chap ,
went missing.

234
00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:27,402
We looked for him for 7 days
but didn't find him.

235
00:41:21,515 --> 00:41:22,846
We found him
on the eighth day.

236
00:41:24,417 --> 00:41:26,214
Poor thing, guess he got
caught in their Camp.

237
00:41:30,925 --> 00:41:32,825
They dug out his eyes,

238
00:41:34,295 --> 00:41:41,394
shoved a Beer bottle
through his body

239
00:41:42,603 --> 00:41:43,661
...and broke it inside him.

240
00:41:44,505 --> 00:41:46,234
We were the ones

241
00:41:46,474 --> 00:41:47,907
who went home and
delivered his dead body.

242
00:41:48,910 --> 00:41:50,207
His Mom was howling,

243
00:41:50,711 --> 00:41:52,144
his Dad was beating
his chest in grief,

244
00:41:53,414 --> 00:41:54,904
his sisters were weeping.

245
00:41:57,952 --> 00:41:59,442
And on the fourteenth day,

246
00:42:01,022 --> 00:42:02,489
his younger brother
joined the Military.

247
00:42:04,425 --> 00:42:08,327
We die there every day, so that
you guys here can live happily.

248
00:42:20,408 --> 00:42:22,103
This is a locally made Gun.

249
00:42:24,345 --> 00:42:25,607
This is my Gun.

250
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:30,578
lf l shoot you,

251
00:42:31,319 --> 00:42:33,480
l will have to explain
why l did so.

252
00:42:34,288 --> 00:42:37,280
Even when you are dead,
your family will slander you.

253
00:42:38,259 --> 00:42:40,989
Your children will have
to beg on the streets.

254
00:42:42,229 --> 00:42:46,791
Your wife will have to beckon
men on the roads at night.

255
00:42:47,902 --> 00:42:50,097
But, if you shoot yourself,
it would be called a suicide

256
00:42:51,606 --> 00:42:56,942
while on duty and someone from
your family will be given a job.

257
00:42:58,312 --> 00:42:59,711
They'll get your
Provident Fund money,

258
00:43:00,314 --> 00:43:01,679
the monthly Pension.

259
00:43:05,486 --> 00:43:06,510
You take a call.

260
00:43:22,589 --> 00:43:27,253
But if that Gun turns
towards me, l'll shoot you.

261
00:43:48,952 --> 00:43:50,977
You are playing with Danger.

262
00:44:35,423 --> 00:44:38,256
l know the two of you are not
aware of everything.

263
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:31,771
When?

264
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:37,300
Try to understand i am getting married

265
00:49:33,818 --> 00:49:33,818
I want to ask you a question?

266
00:49:30,708 --> 00:49:30,708
Is this maths class

267
00:49:25,365 --> 00:49:25,365
Come to the side

268
00:49:15,423 --> 00:49:17,423
You looking beautiful

269
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:20,410
And now. how did you get
married to a guy like this?

270
00:50:21,746 --> 00:50:23,907
Look here, you need
to think practically.

271
00:50:30,366 --> 00:50:32,095
Praise him and
get married to him

272
00:50:44,979 --> 00:50:46,446
Why are you sitting
here like this?

273
00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:49,572
l am thinking about something.
lt's not falling in place.

274
00:50:49,817 --> 00:50:51,079
Tell me what it is.

275
00:50:51,218 --> 00:50:52,515
Let's see if l can
think of something.

276
00:50:53,054 --> 00:50:54,851
l being a Policeman
can't do it

277
00:50:55,222 --> 00:50:56,189
and here you are
thinking you can!

278
00:50:56,424 --> 00:50:58,915
Do you know the difference between
a Policeman and a Military man?

279
00:50:59,827 --> 00:51:01,385
You Military men don't
have to use your brain.

280
00:51:01,929 --> 00:51:03,157
You just have to put have your
feet together for''Attention''

281
00:51:03,397 --> 00:51:05,166
and split them for
''Stand at ease''.

282
00:51:05,166 --> 00:51:06,861
And if you are told to shoot,
you just have to rapidly.

283
00:51:06,934 --> 00:51:09,926
But, we Policemen
have to use our brains.

284
00:51:10,438 --> 00:51:12,167
When we are going to
nab a Pick Pocket,

285
00:51:12,273 --> 00:51:14,036
we have to think like him.

286
00:51:14,542 --> 00:51:15,975
When we are going
to catch a murderer,

287
00:51:16,143 --> 00:51:17,542
we have to think
like a murderer.

288
00:51:17,845 --> 00:51:19,437
And when we are going to
catch a Terrorist,

289
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,147
...we have to turn
in to a Terrorist.

290
00:51:21,348 --> 00:51:24,078
l am a Policeman and yet,
struggling.

291
00:51:24,318 --> 00:51:25,376
You go ahead and play.

292
00:51:25,686 --> 00:51:28,923
Tell me what your problem is,
l'll see if l can help.

293
00:51:28,923 --> 00:51:30,288
l'll tell you,
try and get the drift.

294
00:51:30,691 --> 00:51:33,125
The night that
the Terrorist escaped,

295
00:51:33,561 --> 00:51:36,052
a Police officer shot himself
and committed suicide.

296
00:51:36,430 --> 00:51:39,888
He was on duty when
the Terrorist escaped.

297
00:51:40,234 --> 00:51:45,171
My doubt right now is if these two
incidents could have any connection.

298
00:51:45,406 --> 00:51:47,533
Firstly, that is not a suicide.
lt's a murder.

299
00:51:47,775 --> 00:51:48,400
How do you say that?

300
00:52:03,542 --> 00:52:04,668
l was the one who killed him.

301
00:52:08,245 --> 00:52:10,213
Why did you kill him?

302
00:52:11,481 --> 00:52:13,005
Why did he let
the Terrorist escape?

303
00:52:14,149 --> 00:52:16,515
He let the Terrorist escape?
How do you know that?

304
00:52:16,618 --> 00:52:17,619
The Terrorist told me that.

305
00:52:17,619 --> 00:52:19,610
The Terrorist escaped from the Hospital.
Where did you see him?

306
00:52:19,955 --> 00:52:21,786
Well! The Hospital.

307
00:52:22,991 --> 00:52:23,923
The Hospital.?

308
00:52:30,899 --> 00:52:31,957
l am asking you
where you saw him.

309
00:52:45,270 --> 00:52:46,202
Tell me what it is!

310
00:52:53,875 --> 00:52:55,137
Can l marry you?

311
00:52:56,745 --> 00:52:57,769
When did you get this idea?

312
00:52:58,180 --> 00:53:02,583
This morning. at 8.40am
-What happened at 8.40am?

313
00:53:03,451 --> 00:53:04,748
lt was my friend's reception.

314
00:53:05,187 --> 00:53:06,745
She's the most beautiful
girl in my college.

315
00:53:07,189 --> 00:53:09,123
The guy she is marrying
doesn't look one bit good.

316
00:53:09,324 --> 00:53:14,023
l asked her about it and
she gave me some advice.

317
00:53:14,296 --> 00:53:16,321
And then,
friends encouraged me.

318
00:53:17,499 --> 00:53:21,629
But, we didn't make a good
match right from the start.

319
00:53:22,370 --> 00:53:25,271
l said ''No'' at first
and then you did,

320
00:53:26,107 --> 00:53:26,971
and now you are saying
you want this.

321
00:53:27,576 --> 00:53:28,975
l am only saying l want it.

322
00:53:29,544 --> 00:53:34,140
Yes, but our tastes
should match.

323
00:53:35,984 --> 00:53:37,952
Do you smoke?
- Huh?

324
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:43,254
A Cigarette.
- No way! How can girls smoke?

325
00:53:43,858 --> 00:53:45,450
That is not allowed in Boxing.

326
00:53:45,594 --> 00:53:48,529
See that!
l only like girls who smoke.

327
00:53:53,068 --> 00:53:55,161
Well. l can't say
l've never smoked.

328
00:53:55,503 --> 00:53:59,667
l have smoked at Girls parties,
New Year and occasions like that.

329
00:54:03,111 --> 00:54:04,135
What about Drinks?

330
00:54:05,046 --> 00:54:06,570
Liquor, my dear.

331
00:54:09,751 --> 00:54:11,742
Yes. Red wine.

332
00:54:11,987 --> 00:54:13,921
That's good for
the heart and skin.

333
00:54:14,356 --> 00:54:16,051
l've even tried Vodka once.

334
00:54:16,725 --> 00:54:20,126
See that, l can't stand
girls who drink Liquor.

335
00:54:26,868 --> 00:54:29,837
No!! You are saying different
things on purpose.

336
00:54:29,971 --> 00:54:31,461
You are in love with me.

337
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:33,901
You are purposely doing this
- Saiba, wait..

338
00:54:34,042 --> 00:54:36,067
l came here straight from
the wedding,just for you.

339
00:54:36,311 --> 00:54:37,573
l didn't even eat there.

340
00:54:40,382 --> 00:54:42,350
lf you want, l can get married
to you right away.

341
00:54:43,285 --> 00:54:44,980
l was just kidding.

342
00:54:50,292 --> 00:54:51,554
There is a small hitch.

343
00:54:52,227 --> 00:54:53,922
Again? What is it?

344
00:54:54,763 --> 00:54:56,390
Because l was angry with you,

345
00:54:56,498 --> 00:54:59,023
l agreed to marry another guy
my parents found for me.

346
00:54:59,701 --> 00:55:00,759
You said ''yes'' to him?

347
00:55:01,169 --> 00:55:02,261
That is not a problem.

348
00:55:02,637 --> 00:55:04,832
Saying ''Yes'' at first and
rejecting him after that

349
00:55:05,507 --> 00:55:06,599
...is hardly a problem for me.

350
00:55:08,777 --> 00:55:11,302
What l said to you is different
from what l told him.

351
00:55:11,413 --> 00:55:12,675
He is from the Military too.

352
00:55:14,949 --> 00:55:17,941
lf l convince him,
all problems will be sorted.

353
00:55:18,119 --> 00:55:19,814
He has asked me to come to
the Coffee shop at 1 2.

354
00:55:20,088 --> 00:55:22,556
Ok! l'll come along too!
l'll take care of it.

355
00:55:22,791 --> 00:55:24,224
Shall we leave then?
-Yes.

356
00:55:29,698 --> 00:55:30,528
lt's here.

357
00:55:33,001 --> 00:55:33,990
Just wait a moment.

358
00:55:37,072 --> 00:55:39,131
He's a Military guy,
he's here on time.

359
00:55:39,874 --> 00:55:41,443
l'll go first.
You can come later.

360
00:55:41,443 --> 00:55:44,708
Hey! l'll talk to him first
and then will call

361
00:56:07,702 --> 00:56:09,260
Hey, Virat,
what are you doing here?

362
00:56:09,337 --> 00:56:09,894
How are you?

363
00:56:11,473 --> 00:56:12,838
When l heard the loud voice,

364
00:56:12,974 --> 00:56:14,532
l imagined we were
in the Parade ground.

365
00:56:14,976 --> 00:56:15,772
Ok, come on.

366
00:56:19,848 --> 00:56:20,712
Well!

367
00:56:21,116 --> 00:56:23,880
The girl l am going to marry has
said she would meet me here today.

368
00:56:24,819 --> 00:56:26,912
All this is to meet her...

369
00:56:27,956 --> 00:56:30,686
l am nervous because
this is the first time.

370
00:57:10,131 --> 00:57:10,893
Please sit down.

371
00:57:13,368 --> 00:57:17,270
Your Mom called to say that
you like me a lot as well.

372
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:27,372
Sorry, Saiba. Meet Mr..

373
00:57:29,484 --> 00:57:31,418
But, he is much junior to me.

374
00:57:31,886 --> 00:57:34,047
He makes mistakes and
gets punished very often.

375
00:57:34,856 --> 00:57:37,222
He is a little more scared
of me because of that.

376
00:57:43,331 --> 00:57:45,799
Saiba, what will you eat?
- No. Nothing!

377
00:57:48,102 --> 00:57:49,126
What about you, Jagdish?

378
00:57:51,072 --> 00:57:55,236
Saiba, l have a get together
at the Hotel this evening.

379
00:57:57,445 --> 00:57:59,037
Virat, you must come too.
- Yes, Sir!

380
00:58:00,882 --> 00:58:04,682
Now! lt's 1 2.30.
We said we would meet at 1 2.

381
00:58:09,724 --> 00:58:10,918
So, we'll meet in the evening.

382
00:58:18,032 --> 00:58:19,158
ls he mad?

383
00:58:20,835 --> 00:58:21,631
l'll see you in the evening.

384
00:58:35,316 --> 00:58:36,647
ls this how you planned
to talk to him?

385
00:58:38,453 --> 00:58:39,249
That's not it, Madam.

386
00:58:39,687 --> 00:58:42,247
Whatever it is,
you are his fiance.

387
00:58:42,423 --> 00:58:43,947
Hey! even after he left,
you are calling me ''Madam''

388
00:58:44,225 --> 00:58:45,658
Aren't we in love already.

389
00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:47,857
We can break up with each other.

390
00:58:49,130 --> 00:58:50,563
We've not been in love even
for an hour;

391
00:58:51,032 --> 00:58:52,590
and a break up before that?

392
00:58:52,967 --> 00:58:53,934
Look here, Madam.

393
00:58:54,168 --> 00:58:55,795
He is better than me
in every way.

394
00:58:56,404 --> 00:58:58,702
lt takes me 52 seconds
to run 400 meters,

395
00:58:58,806 --> 00:58:59,966
but he can do that
in 48 seconds.

396
00:59:00,408 --> 00:59:00,942
ln a High jump,

397
00:59:00,942 --> 00:59:02,034
l can get across a height of
6 feet and 1 inch,

398
00:59:02,143 --> 00:59:03,474
but he can cover 6 feet
and 4 inches?

399
00:59:03,578 --> 00:59:05,239
ln the Long jump,
l can leap across only 7 meters,

400
00:59:05,380 --> 00:59:06,540
but he is 7.4 meters.

401
00:59:06,948 --> 00:59:07,539
ln Weight lifting...

402
00:59:08,683 --> 00:59:10,275
ls someone recruiting people
for the Military here?

403
00:59:10,418 --> 00:59:11,646
l don't like him.

404
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:14,445
But, you didn't like me
at first either,

405
00:59:14,589 --> 00:59:15,351
but you like me now.

406
00:59:15,456 --> 00:59:17,048
You don't like him now,
but you could like him tomorrow.

407
00:59:20,295 --> 00:59:21,489
They are two
different things.

408
00:59:21,696 --> 00:59:24,460
Not just that.
l can find a match easily.

409
00:59:24,732 --> 00:59:28,224
But who will marry him
at this age.

410
00:59:28,536 --> 00:59:30,629
What do l do for that, why me?

411
00:59:35,573 --> 00:59:36,562
Your phone is ringing.

412
00:59:36,707 --> 00:59:37,537
lt's your phone.

413
00:59:46,780 --> 00:59:49,772
Hey!Where did you see the Terrorist
who escaped from the Hospital?

414
00:59:47,785 --> 00:59:49,013
Will tell you later,

415
00:59:54,488 --> 00:59:56,251
The two of us have an
important job to do tomorrow.

416
01:00:13,806 --> 01:00:15,865
Hey!Why are you
sitting here?

417
01:00:12,142 --> 01:00:14,007
Like you don't know
why l've come!

418
01:00:15,379 --> 01:00:16,038
lt's not that.

419
01:00:16,179 --> 01:00:17,578
Don't come in to
my room all of a sudden.

420
01:00:36,183 --> 01:00:37,810
Where did you see
that Terrorist?

421
01:00:42,233 --> 01:00:44,326
How did you catch the guy
who escaped from the Hospital?

422
01:00:45,769 --> 01:00:48,567
After you left that day,
l stayed back at the Hospital.

423
01:00:50,540 --> 01:00:51,336
We shouldn't keep him here,

424
01:00:51,474 --> 01:00:52,498
we must hand him
over to the Police.

425
01:00:54,909 --> 01:00:56,069
For him to escape again?

426
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,627
Only then will we know how
many more of them are around.

427
01:01:03,149 --> 01:01:04,241
Why are you taking
the lnjection?

428
01:01:08,391 --> 01:01:09,358
Don't untie him.

429
01:01:12,262 --> 01:01:13,320
Where are you going?

430
01:01:13,430 --> 01:01:14,920
How many questions
will you ask?

431
01:01:16,066 --> 01:01:19,035
l've injected him
with Ketamine.

432
01:01:19,402 --> 01:01:21,336
He will remain
unconscious for two hours.

433
01:01:21,504 --> 01:01:22,027
Let's go.

434
01:01:22,238 --> 01:01:23,170
Where do we go?

435
01:01:23,273 --> 01:01:24,069
To the Wedding.

436
01:01:24,374 --> 01:01:25,534
My Batch mate is
getting married today.

437
01:01:25,709 --> 01:01:26,573
Let's go.

438
01:01:27,110 --> 01:01:27,940
This is a bit too much.

439
01:01:28,044 --> 01:01:29,705
You want to keep him at home
and go out to attend a wedding?

440
01:01:30,013 --> 01:01:30,809
You've even untied him.

441
01:01:31,014 --> 01:01:32,072
We'll come back.

442
01:02:30,390 --> 01:02:31,254
Who is this?

443
01:03:37,036 --> 01:03:38,162
He wants to play,
be it the Camp or...

444
01:03:39,471 --> 01:03:41,336
...where the Train stops
now even at the Wedding.

445
01:03:43,197 --> 01:03:46,462
Guys, this is a serious game.

446
01:03:50,034 --> 01:03:53,003
We'll all in one team

447
01:04:25,538 --> 01:04:26,835
ln two minutes from now,

448
01:04:27,173 --> 01:04:30,267
a man will come out of
the back door of my house.

449
01:04:31,878 --> 01:04:33,971
We will follow him.

450
01:04:34,413 --> 01:04:35,903
When he meets a man
after that,

451
01:04:36,349 --> 01:04:37,680
our group will split
into two.

452
01:04:38,284 --> 01:04:39,581
One group of 6 will
follow one man.

453
01:04:40,219 --> 01:04:41,811
the next 6 will
follow the other.

454
01:04:42,421 --> 01:04:44,616
As they keep meeting
more people after that,

455
01:04:45,291 --> 01:04:48,089
we will divide further
and follow them.

456
01:04:48,528 --> 01:04:50,962
Keep your cell phones on.

457
01:04:51,230 --> 01:04:53,721
Don't attend any
other call but mine.

458
01:04:54,133 --> 01:04:57,466
We will stay connected
through a conference call.

459
01:05:18,913 --> 01:05:21,575
He is coming.
- ls he the guy?

460
01:05:25,926 --> 01:05:27,154
lt's a risk only if
we don't do anything.

461
01:05:32,695 --> 01:05:35,528
Start the vehicle and
slowly follow him.

462
01:06:19,287 --> 01:06:20,276
Who is the other guy?

463
01:06:22,694 --> 01:06:25,720
What if they don't split
as 1 2 but stay at one place?

464
01:06:26,131 --> 01:06:28,531
No, they have work at 1 2 places.

465
01:06:31,670 --> 01:06:32,568
Stop the vehicle.

466
01:06:50,425 --> 01:06:51,392
You follow him.

467
01:10:01,869 --> 01:10:05,100
Boys! We are 1 2 of us
for 1 2 of them.

468
01:10:05,907 --> 01:10:07,204
The game is going to end now.

469
01:10:07,609 --> 01:10:09,042
Look at the Case in your bag.

470
01:10:11,878 --> 01:10:13,573
There is a gun inside
There is a gun

471
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,126
Let no one panic.

472
01:10:17,119 --> 01:10:18,143
l was the one who kept it.

473
01:10:19,821 --> 01:10:22,346
The guys in front of you
are no ordinary thieves.

474
01:10:35,862 --> 01:10:38,797
techniques of serial bomb blasts
and simultaneous blasts.

475
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,365
without a seconds' difference.

476
01:11:56,837 --> 01:11:58,771
Who are these sleeper cells?

477
01:11:59,406 --> 01:12:01,033
Sleeper cells are
present at places

478
01:12:01,441 --> 01:12:03,306
Where terrorism is a challenge

479
01:12:03,677 --> 01:12:05,269
We can't identify them, because..

480
01:12:05,646 --> 01:12:09,605
Even these 1 2 men have led
a normal life with the public

481
01:12:09,883 --> 01:12:13,284
They are people who have druid
against the country and the government

482
01:12:13,420 --> 01:12:15,615
They are cultivated for years.

483
01:12:15,989 --> 01:12:20,085
And their grudge is misused
for terrorist activities

484
01:12:20,227 --> 01:12:22,889
After 9/1 1 the U S is free
from terrorism because..

485
01:12:23,297 --> 01:12:25,162
...only in that country
sleeper cell

486
01:12:25,299 --> 01:12:27,494
have been identified and
destroyed completely.

487
01:12:27,701 --> 01:12:29,259
..and their further growth
was arrested

488
01:13:40,842 --> 01:13:42,104
Mom, Dad

489
01:14:05,538 --> 01:14:06,937
Who did all this?

490
01:14:09,039 --> 01:14:10,438
lt is still unknown

491
01:14:13,642 --> 01:14:15,234
Even the policemen are clueless

492
01:14:15,712 --> 01:14:16,872
Did you get any clue?

493
01:14:18,413 --> 01:14:21,940
The police has seized the equipments
of all the 1 2 sleeper cells

494
01:14:22,384 --> 01:14:24,978
But the non tracker phone
that belonged to one of them...

495
01:14:25,420 --> 01:14:27,888
..has been taken by the person
who killed him.

496
01:14:27,025 --> 01:14:27,992
Whose phone is it?

497
01:14:32,693 --> 01:14:34,923
Adzar Ali, the one was
killed 

498
01:15:35,714 --> 01:15:37,714
No' idea who you are?

499
01:15:40,110 --> 01:15:42,110
You kill my 12 people

500
01:15:43,308 --> 01:15:45,308
One was my brother

501
01:15:48,907 --> 01:15:50,907
I am coming

502
01:15:53,706 --> 01:15:55,706
Where ever you are i'll finish you

503
01:15:57,106 --> 01:15:59,106
I'm waiting

504
01:18:15,806 --> 01:18:17,806
What is the height for this wall

505
01:18:20,156 --> 01:18:22,156
They are good jumper's

506
01:18:25,331 --> 01:18:27,331
What was the speed of the bus

507
01:18:35,918 --> 01:18:37,918
They also no swimming

508
01:18:40,211 --> 01:18:42,211
They kill my 12 men on the forehead

509
01:19:01,358 --> 01:19:03,358
Train shooter's
They are not policemen

510
01:19:04,932 --> 01:19:06,932
Any common with this 12 people

511
01:19:17,719 --> 01:19:19,719
They all was wearing suit's

512
01:20:22,511 --> 01:20:22,511
You think you are smart

513
01:20:12,112 --> 01:20:14,112
I want a list of all the wedding

514
01:20:40,413 --> 01:20:41,710
Yes, they are Sleeper Cells.

515
01:20:42,248 --> 01:20:45,513
One or may be two of their
Heads will make the plan.

516
01:20:46,052 --> 01:20:47,451
The Sleeper Cells merely execute

517
01:20:47,620 --> 01:20:50,418
...and will even be willing
to lose their lives for it.

518
01:20:50,757 --> 01:20:52,691
Even if one of them
does get caught,

519
01:20:52,825 --> 01:20:54,588
there is nothing we can
get to know through him.

520
01:20:54,794 --> 01:20:56,694
Does that mean Sleeper Cells
carry on lives...

521
01:20:56,863 --> 01:20:58,228
...as normal people
until they get orders?

522
01:20:58,398 --> 01:21:00,525
Yes, they will wait for years.

523
01:21:00,700 --> 01:21:02,429
ls there no way
we can kill them all?

524
01:21:03,336 --> 01:21:06,635
We can't kill them, but we can
stop them from functioning.

525
01:21:07,607 --> 01:21:10,599
lf we kill the main head
who gives the orders,

526
01:21:11,211 --> 01:21:15,375
these guys will keep waiting
for orders all their lives.

527
01:21:15,582 --> 01:21:16,276
That's fine.

528
01:21:16,416 --> 01:21:18,043
But, how will you search for
the leader? who gives out orders.

529
01:21:18,518 --> 01:21:19,849
l don't have to go in
search of him.

530
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:21,844
l've made him come in
search of me.

531
01:21:22,322 --> 01:21:26,349
lf we killed the 1 2 of them,
he would retaliate by attacking us.

532
01:21:26,492 --> 01:21:27,584
That was my assessment.

533
01:21:27,794 --> 01:21:29,523
l was right.
He's out to get me.

534
01:21:29,729 --> 01:21:30,889
Oh, my God!

535
01:21:31,097 --> 01:21:33,861
But, how will he find you
in a big city like Mumbai?

536
01:21:36,002 --> 01:21:37,731
While killing the 1 2,

537
01:21:38,671 --> 01:21:41,504
we would have surely left
behind some kind of a clue.

538
01:21:42,842 --> 01:21:44,207
He will work
towards finding that.

539
01:21:44,944 --> 01:21:46,935
lf we find out what that is,

540
01:21:47,614 --> 01:21:49,878
we can catch him
before he attacks us.

541
01:22:36,406 --> 01:22:39,000
Your senior officer has asked the
both of us to come over to his house.

542
01:22:40,043 --> 01:22:41,032
l am coming.

543
01:22:41,778 --> 01:22:43,302
Virat, this is wrong.

544
01:22:43,713 --> 01:22:45,305
Look at what are you doing
amidst our important work

545
01:22:45,482 --> 01:22:47,677
Don't run behind a girl,
sit here and think of something.

546
01:24:10,008 --> 01:24:11,498
Why don't the two of you
get married?

547
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:14,372
Don't get me wrong.

548
01:24:17,815 --> 01:24:21,774
We were in love,
but never once did l touch her.

549
01:24:23,087 --> 01:24:24,315
Ask her.We haven't.

550
01:24:29,523 --> 01:24:33,084
l know you will find it
difficult to forget me.

551
01:24:33,395 --> 01:24:34,760
Can l be faulted
for being handsome?

552
01:29:07,746 --> 01:29:08,770
lt's our first date.

553
01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:11,047
As per rules of dating,

554
01:29:14,182 --> 01:29:17,709
l can't refuse anything a
boyfriend asks of me.

555
01:29:20,021 --> 01:29:24,720
Hey! Come on! You've already
spent a lot of money for.

556
01:29:27,797 --> 01:29:30,425
What if you ask me
for a kiss?

557
01:29:30,534 --> 01:29:33,230
How can l refuse that?

558
01:30:56,608 --> 01:30:58,667
Virat, this is Amar Singh.

559
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:00,695
Someone kidnapped
my brother's daughter.

560
01:32:30,015 --> 01:32:32,074
Yes, she went jogging
with her friend this morning.

561
01:32:32,418 --> 01:32:33,976
Someone forcefully dragged her
in to a vehicle.

562
01:34:04,245 --> 01:34:06,145
The fifth girl
has gone missing too! Yes!!

563
01:34:06,414 --> 01:34:08,473
Are you human?
You are a sadist!!

564
01:34:09,616 --> 01:34:11,709
Are you even feeling bad that
the girls have gone missing?

565
01:34:15,952 --> 01:34:18,020
You want to kill
the Head of the Sleeper Cell.

566
01:34:23,658 --> 01:34:26,183
Mumbai city will not have
terrorist acts for the many years.

567
01:34:35,763 --> 01:34:37,594
Did you even think of what
their families will go through?

568
01:34:45,740 --> 01:34:48,971
My sister is one the girls
they've kidnapped.

569
01:34:50,712 --> 01:34:52,577
He will keep all the
kidnapped girls in one place.

570
01:34:56,214 --> 01:34:58,341
We have to save them
and get him as well.

571
01:35:05,120 --> 01:35:07,816
l sent my sister Sanjana
Where are you?

572
01:35:18,132 --> 01:35:19,622
Why should l bring her Bike?

573
01:35:23,268 --> 01:35:24,235
Do what l ask you to.

574
01:35:25,436 --> 01:35:27,996
Fine! There is a 40 percent Off
Sale at Levis.

575
01:35:28,172 --> 01:35:29,969
Will you buy me a
pair of three fourths?

576
01:35:30,009 --> 01:35:30,998
Fine, you hurry.

577
01:36:18,284 --> 01:36:19,842
This is Preeti's Dupatta.

578
01:36:20,219 --> 01:36:23,052
Buy me a Maroon colored Top, it
should have embroidery on the sides.

579
01:36:34,731 --> 01:36:36,790
l will look around for
anything suspicious. Let's see.

580
01:37:14,336 --> 01:37:15,428
Untie them

581
01:37:22,845 --> 01:37:24,176
Project the photo one by one

582
01:37:26,649 --> 01:37:27,707
Who knows him?

583
01:37:33,188 --> 01:37:34,348
He is my brother.

584
01:37:35,591 --> 01:37:36,683
Go that side.

585
01:37:45,434 --> 01:37:46,298
That's my Uncle.

586
01:38:01,183 --> 01:38:02,081
Who is this?

587
01:38:03,986 --> 01:38:04,816
ls he your Brother?

588
01:38:07,556 --> 01:38:08,420
Yours?

589
01:38:08,691 --> 01:38:09,385
No.

590
01:38:16,598 --> 01:38:17,792
Show the other photograph.

591
01:38:21,070 --> 01:38:22,002
This is my Brother.

592
01:38:33,816 --> 01:38:35,875
ls your Brother one among
these 5 people?

593
01:38:37,352 --> 01:38:38,182
No.

594
01:38:39,321 --> 01:38:41,221
Show the group photos one by one.

595
01:38:48,664 --> 01:38:50,097
ls your Brother in this group?

596
01:39:08,217 --> 01:39:09,206
That one?

597
01:39:18,494 --> 01:39:20,086
Who asked you to get
the Bike of the girl...

598
01:39:20,195 --> 01:39:21,958
...who was going
to be kidnapped?

599
01:39:23,632 --> 01:39:24,530
My Brother asked me to.

600
01:39:41,049 --> 01:39:41,913
Tell me

601
01:39:42,151 --> 01:39:45,643
The operation in over
We have found the team

602
01:39:46,355 --> 01:39:49,950
One of them has replaced
and sent his sister on purpose

603
01:39:51,093 --> 01:39:55,496
We removed all their sim cards
There is no way he can find us

604
01:39:57,800 --> 01:40:00,826
lf he has sent his sister,
he has a route yo reach you.

605
01:40:01,036 --> 01:40:03,129
He will get to you.
-What are you saying?

606
01:40:03,405 --> 01:40:06,340
Before he comes Kill that girl
and get out of that place.

607
01:40:08,577 --> 01:40:11,341
Get ready, all of you.
Tie up the 4 girls.

608
01:40:11,580 --> 01:40:14,048
Tie this girl up and
bring her here. Hurry up!!

609
01:42:03,821 --> 01:42:04,719
He has come

610
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:05,000
He is trying
to kill everyone.

611
01:45:55,422 --> 01:45:57,219
He held a huge Knife against me!
Right here.

612
01:45:57,624 --> 01:45:59,114
He might have pulled it out.

613
01:45:59,726 --> 01:46:03,389
Only because we risked lives
could we catch him.

614
01:46:03,730 --> 01:46:05,630
You should have risked
your life for that.

615
01:46:05,965 --> 01:46:06,693
What did l do?

616
01:46:08,001 --> 01:46:10,629
Do only Policemen and Military men
have to die during troubles like this?

617
01:46:11,004 --> 01:46:13,996
Will all of you do nothing
but swap news channels...

618
01:46:14,274 --> 01:46:17,038
...and exchange ideas on what
should have been done?

619
01:46:17,911 --> 01:46:21,210
What would have happened if a bullet
had hit me during your crossfire?

620
01:46:21,748 --> 01:46:23,113
You would have been dead once.

621
01:46:27,587 --> 01:46:29,522
Those guys who want to kill
thousands of people...

622
01:46:29,522 --> 01:46:30,682
...aren't scared of
giving up their lives.

623
01:46:31,357 --> 01:46:32,517
We think of saving lives,

624
01:46:32,625 --> 01:46:34,024
we shouldn't worry about
our lives either.

625
01:46:50,627 --> 01:46:53,926
The main man has been
caught alive now.

626
01:46:54,164 --> 01:46:55,290
He is not the main guy.

627
01:46:55,699 --> 01:46:57,462
Someone called him
and gave him orders.

628
01:46:57,601 --> 01:46:59,159
They brought out their
knives only after that.

629
01:48:15,408 --> 01:48:16,432
Why did you come here?

630
01:48:16,943 --> 01:48:19,241
You left me half way.
That is why l came here.

631
01:48:20,246 --> 01:48:24,945
You should not come here all of
a sudden and try to scare me.

632
01:48:25,118 --> 01:48:25,584
Why?

633
01:48:25,718 --> 01:48:28,414
You can't be sure that l will be
the only person in this room.

634
01:48:33,026 --> 01:48:34,084
Sand Bag. Dumb Bells.

635
01:48:34,861 --> 01:48:36,055
Do you work out?

636
01:48:39,999 --> 01:48:42,399
Did you know?
l read this in a message.

637
01:48:43,102 --> 01:48:46,230
40 calories get burnt
in one deep kiss.

638
01:48:52,212 --> 01:48:54,203
lf you want to be kissed,
ask me directly;

639
01:48:54,847 --> 01:48:56,337
don't hint at it by saying you
read this in a message...

640
01:48:56,482 --> 01:48:58,382
... or this is as per some rule

641
01:48:59,385 --> 01:49:04,049
You lead us on and
then claim Men are mean.

642
01:49:04,824 --> 01:49:05,654
You might as well
stand in a queue...

643
01:49:05,825 --> 01:49:07,224
...and buy kerosene instead of
asking him for a kiss.

644
01:49:12,732 --> 01:49:16,031
You are here anyway,
why the fuss?

645
01:49:16,402 --> 01:49:17,630
Why burn 40 calories,

646
01:49:19,038 --> 01:49:21,006
let's burn 80 calories!

647
01:49:30,750 --> 01:49:32,047
Not here. Let's go there.

648
01:49:36,289 --> 01:49:37,881
You are the one
laying down rules now.

649
01:49:40,426 --> 01:49:41,518
Close your eyes.

650
01:49:46,966 --> 01:49:48,558
lf l close my eyes,
you will run away.

651
01:49:59,646 --> 01:50:01,409
l told you.
My mom has come.

652
01:50:01,948 --> 01:50:03,711
Oh! God!
What do we do now?

653
01:50:06,252 --> 01:50:07,378
Open the door first.

654
01:50:09,555 --> 01:50:10,356
Where are you going?

655
01:50:10,356 --> 01:50:11,550
l am going to hide
in the Cupboard.

656
01:50:12,025 --> 01:50:14,016
That Cupboard engaged.
You get in to this.

657
01:50:25,938 --> 01:50:27,963
What is it Mom.
lt's you.!

658
01:50:29,809 --> 01:50:30,935
Did you watch TV.?

659
01:50:31,077 --> 01:50:33,637
ls this on TV already?
ls there a camera in the room?

660
01:50:34,147 --> 01:50:37,605
l am coming from there.
l saw what you did.

661
01:50:37,984 --> 01:50:41,010
1 6 people have died.
All of them belong to the Sleeper Cells.

662
01:50:41,721 --> 01:50:42,881
They lead normal lives.

663
01:50:43,156 --> 01:50:45,090
Their families are weeping
for them.

664
01:50:45,358 --> 01:50:46,757
None of them believe this
to be true.

665
01:50:47,694 --> 01:50:48,558
This is what we expected.

666
01:50:48,695 --> 01:50:51,528
Did you find a clue about
the Head of the Sleeper Cell?

667
01:50:59,739 --> 01:51:00,671
l expected this

668
01:51:01,040 --> 01:51:04,476
He is not the main guy.
We missed the one giving the orders.

669
01:51:06,145 --> 01:51:07,635
Why is he coughing
in a woman's voice?

670
01:51:22,161 --> 01:51:27,895
Don't you have the habit of keeping
clothes or books in your Cupboard?

671
01:51:32,004 --> 01:51:33,301
Are you going to marry?

672
01:51:34,273 --> 01:51:35,900
You want only the Petromax light,
don't you?

673
01:51:36,876 --> 01:51:38,468
Yes.
Then your life will be coma

674
01:57:15,409 --> 01:57:16,706
Hey,Virat, how are you?

675
01:57:21,010 --> 01:57:22,238
Kapil, where are you?

676
01:57:22,345 --> 01:57:24,438
l have come out with my family.
-Yes, where?

677
01:57:27,950 --> 01:57:30,253
There is a bomb in that building.
Come out now.

678
01:57:30,253 --> 01:57:31,481
What are you saying?

679
01:57:37,160 --> 01:57:39,321
There are so many of them here.

680
01:57:39,595 --> 01:57:42,860
Listen to me, alert everyone and
get them out of there.

681
01:57:43,933 --> 01:57:45,127
Come on menthol out!

682
02:00:20,905 --> 02:00:24,272
lt is only in the Army and Police that
we are awarded with retirement

683
02:00:40,818 --> 02:00:43,844
l have already spoken
to each of you on the phone.

684
02:00:44,956 --> 02:00:47,083
This is the time
l have been waiting for.

685
02:00:47,925 --> 02:00:51,122
We are going to execute
an assignment together.

686
02:00:54,432 --> 02:00:58,698
l am going to meet the guy who controls
the Sleeper Cells tommorrow.

687
02:00:59,203 --> 02:01:02,331
No one can follow me
when l go to meet him.

688
02:01:03,207 --> 02:01:06,142
Hence, even before l go to meet him,

689
02:01:07,011 --> 02:01:09,639
l will insert
a tracking chip inside me.

690
02:01:10,081 --> 02:01:13,584
You should track the chip from
the Control Room

691
02:01:13,584 --> 02:01:15,449
and keep him informed about
its movements.

692
02:01:16,320 --> 02:01:20,586
l have secretly procured explosives
that we use in the Army.

693
02:01:20,858 --> 02:01:22,883
That should reach
all of you this evening.

694
02:01:23,261 --> 02:01:28,995
You should make the C4 Plastic explosive
using that and hand it over to him.

695
02:01:29,400 --> 02:01:33,803
After you get to know about
my whereabouts 

696
02:01:33,971 --> 02:01:34,903
Bring it there

697
02:01:35,673 --> 02:01:39,973
l think they will surely
take me to an isolated place

698
02:01:41,646 --> 02:01:45,446
You must leave the vehicle carrying
these explosives in thats place

699
02:01:48,619 --> 02:01:52,578
l still don't know
why they want me alive.

700
02:01:53,391 --> 02:01:56,758
But in the fifteenth minute of me
meeting the Sleeper Cells Head,

701
02:01:58,296 --> 02:01:59,194
...the bomb must explode.

702
02:02:00,564 --> 02:02:05,024
Along with me, the guy who gives orders
for the Sleeper Head will be gone.

703
02:02:05,236 --> 02:02:09,536
After that, all Sleeper Cells
will become Coma Cells.

704
02:02:10,041 --> 02:02:12,942
They will not get
any orders all their life.

705
02:02:22,720 --> 02:02:24,051
Are you kidding?

706
02:02:24,188 --> 02:02:26,418
You are talking about a Suicide Attack
and they are applauding!

707
02:02:27,058 --> 02:02:28,726
He is a very dangerous guy.

708
02:02:28,726 --> 02:02:31,593
But, why are you saying you will die?
Did you think about your family?

709
02:02:32,797 --> 02:02:34,321
Who doesn't have a family?

710
02:02:35,199 --> 02:02:36,223
When the Taj was attacked,

711
02:02:36,801 --> 02:02:38,894
the Men told their children
that they would see them soon.

712
02:02:39,403 --> 02:02:43,174
Hemant Karkare and Vijay Salaskar
died in 20 minutes,

713
02:02:43,174 --> 02:02:44,141
...only their dead bodies returned.

714
02:02:44,275 --> 02:02:45,469
Didn't they have families?

715
02:02:47,144 --> 02:02:48,634
What about these people.

716
02:02:48,746 --> 02:02:51,544
They've lost their limbs
in the same war, yet are happy.

717
02:02:51,916 --> 02:02:53,144
Don't they have families?

718
02:03:03,160 --> 02:03:05,993
An Army man has no better
opportunity than this.

719
02:03:10,267 --> 02:03:11,635
Even the guys who want to kill

720
02:03:11,635 --> 02:03:13,762
...thousands of people are ready
to sacrifice their lives.

721
02:03:14,338 --> 02:03:17,967
Even those of us who want to save lives
should be ready to sacrifice our lives.

722
02:03:20,011 --> 02:03:21,808
l have made a clear decision.

723
02:03:22,947 --> 02:03:25,415
lf you think you want to do
something for me.

724
02:03:29,854 --> 02:03:33,881
People at home are innocent.

725
02:03:50,526 --> 02:03:51,493
And l have two sisters.

726
02:03:54,497 --> 02:03:57,989
lf you are free,
check on them every now and then.

727
02:04:10,985 --> 02:04:13,453
We have just four days left
for the Engagement.

728
02:04:14,522 --> 02:04:16,217
Why are you calling
it off all of a sudden?

729
02:04:17,925 --> 02:04:20,519
Let's not have it for now.

730
02:04:21,762 --> 02:04:23,787
We'll consider this when
l am here the next time.

731
02:04:25,666 --> 02:04:29,003
The wedding is only next year;
it's just the Engagement now.

732
02:04:29,003 --> 02:04:32,166
Yes. Let's not have it now.

733
02:04:33,474 --> 02:04:37,274
You first said you didn't like me,
later, you said you did.

734
02:04:39,580 --> 02:04:42,242
Do you not like me again?

735
02:04:46,353 --> 02:04:47,547
Won't you understand?

736
02:04:53,494 --> 02:04:57,021
But, l don't know if
l'd be able to forget you.

737
02:04:59,700 --> 02:05:00,667
lt'll take me long.

738
02:11:10,223 --> 02:11:11,485
You don't know why you
haven't been killed,

739
02:11:11,691 --> 02:11:14,421
or our plan for you, right?

740
02:11:25,738 --> 02:11:27,968
These are vehicles you have parked.

741
02:11:32,712 --> 02:11:34,077
See what they have in them.

742
02:11:41,787 --> 02:11:43,345
We are not going to let it explode.

743
02:11:44,423 --> 02:11:45,890
We will inform the Police.

744
02:11:46,158 --> 02:11:48,820
Ouestions will be asked about
who put them there.

745
02:11:49,128 --> 02:11:50,026
And then...

746
02:12:08,447 --> 02:12:10,745
...when the Police come
in search of you,

747
02:12:10,850 --> 02:12:13,478
...we would have killed you and
all your team mates.

748
02:12:14,654 --> 02:12:16,383
Do you know who would have killed
you and...

749
02:12:16,622 --> 02:12:20,353
...diffused these bombs at
the right time?

750
02:12:20,860 --> 02:12:21,884
Look at the monitor.

751
02:12:23,563 --> 02:12:25,053
Joint Secretary in Defense.

752
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:30,628
We will say that
it is his team that...

753
02:12:30,903 --> 02:12:33,201
...killed the 1 2 people during
the shoot out, earlier.

754
02:12:35,408 --> 02:12:38,707
They will come to a conclusion that
you are a double agent.

755
02:12:41,714 --> 02:12:44,808
He will get promoted as
the next Defense Secretary.

756
02:12:45,151 --> 02:12:49,144
So far, it is only the lndian Army
that didn't have Sleeper Cells.

757
02:12:51,791 --> 02:12:57,127
Through him, we'll get a lot of recruits
for the Sleeper Cells in the Army;

758
02:12:57,997 --> 02:12:59,555
...we'll do whatever
we want after that.

759
02:13:18,268 --> 02:13:19,530
l shouldn't die.

760
02:13:22,504 --> 02:13:26,201
Sleeper Cells in the Army is akin to
the Nation suffering from Cancer.

761
02:16:43,491 --> 02:16:46,221
Release the lock now and hit me.

762
02:16:47,995 --> 02:16:48,654
What?

763
02:17:10,551 --> 02:17:11,813
Listen

764
02:17:12,353 --> 02:17:14,685
Your Boss beat me up
when my hands were tied.

765
02:17:15,523 --> 02:17:17,057
l am asking him to unlock me
and he's hesitating.

766
02:17:17,057 --> 02:17:21,357
You broke my hand; you have
Your men around yet you fear me

767
02:17:23,731 --> 02:17:25,824
You better fear me

768
02:17:28,536 --> 02:17:32,131
You broke my hand;
you have so many men with you...

769
02:17:32,373 --> 02:17:34,739
Yet you fear to release
the lock and hit me.

770
02:17:37,011 --> 02:17:39,002
l like that fear.

771
02:18:07,417 --> 02:18:09,715
What are you doing, shoot him.

772
02:18:10,155 --> 02:18:14,216
Listen to me,just shoot him.
You can't beat him.

773
02:20:34,158 --> 02:20:36,361
These two will beat
each other to death.

774
02:21:06,361 --> 02:21:07,885
l can shoot him if you let me.

775
02:21:09,096 --> 02:21:10,757
No way!!
What do l do?

776
02:21:50,620 --> 02:21:51,587
l am telling you!

777
02:21:52,256 --> 02:21:52,813
Kill them both.

778
02:22:41,307 --> 02:22:42,501
You are not smart enough.

779
02:22:44,276 --> 02:22:45,368
Even if you kill me,

780
02:22:45,678 --> 02:22:49,978
...details that control
the Sleeper Cell are in that Ship.

781
02:22:50,783 --> 02:22:52,978
They will continue.

782
02:23:38,723 --> 02:23:39,815
You don't understand, do you?

783
02:23:42,058 --> 02:23:43,491
You can die with that suspense.

784
02:24:00,819 --> 02:24:03,289
Had he said he liked this girl
at the first instance,

785
02:24:03,289 --> 02:24:04,551
we could have got him married

786
02:24:04,823 --> 02:24:05,619
The same with her.

787
02:24:05,724 --> 02:24:06,349
What do we do?

788
02:24:06,625 --> 02:24:08,092
He's not serious about anything.

789
02:24:13,632 --> 02:24:14,792
They are a super pair, Sir.

790
02:24:17,369 --> 02:24:19,803
if they are together today,
l am responsible for it.

791
02:24:19,939 --> 02:24:20,871
You are?
- Yes!

792
02:24:42,407 --> 02:24:46,503
On the very day we arrived,
his Dad rushed him to see this girl.

793
02:24:50,312 --> 02:24:52,380
At first he said he didn't like her,
and then she said she didn't like him.

794
02:24:54,815 --> 02:24:56,612
some ldiot came in between them
and confused everything.

795
02:24:57,984 --> 02:24:59,645
Things have been solved only now.

796
02:25:02,054 --> 02:25:04,579
But, how are you saying that
you brought them together.

797
02:25:08,324 --> 02:25:11,623
You spoke about an ldiot
that came between them,

798
02:25:11,827 --> 02:25:13,294
l am the ldiot.

799
02:25:18,067 --> 02:25:20,001
Hey!What is it?

800
02:25:35,569 --> 02:25:37,002
The Army is truly great.

801
02:25:37,137 --> 02:25:38,331
For another 1 1 months,

802
02:25:38,505 --> 02:25:40,370
you are going to be in
a Desert or a Snow clad mountain...

803
02:25:40,908 --> 02:25:43,477
You will have to live your life
in some dimly lit tent,

804
02:25:43,477 --> 02:25:45,879
and thinking of these 40 days..

805
02:24:40,879 --> 02:24:43,315
Keep on seeing family photos
over and over again

806
02:24:43,315 --> 02:24:44,873
And live with it right.
