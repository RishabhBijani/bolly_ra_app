1
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:31,791
Back. Back.

2
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:33,500
Go back.

3
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,791
Move.

4
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:38,375
Move back. Move.

5
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:44,166
Otherwise I will turn you into Anarkali.

6
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:46,500
Children, what did I write here?

7
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,750
Bablu, you tell me.

8
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,250
Fature!

9
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:52,208
Does this look like 'Fature'.

10
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:54,000
How many times have I told you?

11
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,375
It's 'Fature' (Future).

12
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:57,041
Teacher, someone here to see you.

13
00:02:57,541 --> 00:02:58,500
I'm coming.

14
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,041
Kneel.

15
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:03,041
Kneel.

16
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:06,166
Shell it out. Come on.

17
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:08,666
Quickly. - Open it.

18
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:10,083
Bring more tomorrow.

19
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:11,666
Where's your lunch-box?

20
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:13,291
Hurry up. Hurry up.

21
00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:16,041
Lunchbox. - Quickly.

22
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:17,000
Quickly.

23
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,166
Stand up.

24
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:19,750
Stop laying eggs, where's your lunchbox?

25
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:23,583
Hurry up, or that baldy will catch us. - Open your lunchbox.

26
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:24,583
Lunchbox.

27
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:26,208
Get it tomorrow, or I'll shoot you.

28
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:27,708
Give it.

29
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:28,625
Give it.

30
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,083
Otherwise your 'fature' will be in dark.

31
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:31,666
Next time I won't spare you.

32
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:33,875
Rascals...you're back again.

33
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:35,791
Run! Run! - Stop.

34
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:39,791
Scoundrels, I won't spare you two.

35
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,875
Hey...it's got a twisted barrel.

36
00:03:57,375 --> 00:04:00,125
I see.

37
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:02,416
It's fine. What's the problem?

38
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:05,625
If it's okay, why do I keep missing?

39
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:08,833
You won't if you know how to.

40
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:12,708
You little rat, why don't you show me how?

41
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:17,333
Rascal, even Pali can do that.

42
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:19,500
What's the target?

43
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,541
I see...

44
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:24,083
Bhure, take this.

45
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:28,333
Go. Go.

46
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:31,666
Come on.

47
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:35,666
Come on. I'll show you.

48
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:56,000
Rascal...

49
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:00,000
That's your target, not this.

50
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:18,041
What's this? - Fine, keep it.

51
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:19,000
I'll pay the rest later.

52
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,000
I am not going anywhere.

53
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,708
"May our friendship begin.."

54
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:48,541
"..where all bonds severe ties."

55
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:54,416
"At every step, every second.."

56
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:57,416
"May our friendship begin.."

57
00:05:57,916 --> 00:06:00,208
"..where all bonds severe ties."

58
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:06,083
"At every step, every second.."

59
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:11,875
"If you've read my heart."

60
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:15,875
"There's nothing more can I say."

61
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,541
"My companion."

62
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:35,416
"You're my friend."

63
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:41,250
"Our bond is the most unique."

64
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:44,250
"My companion."

65
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,166
"You're my friend."

66
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:51,166
"Our bond is the most unique."

67
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:07,541
"I believe you, even when you lie."

68
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:13,416
"I know even before you admit."

69
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:19,291
"Whether you're good...or bad."

70
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:23,291
"Whether you're right...or wrong."

71
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,333
Where were you?

72
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:52,958
And why bring these roosters?

73
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:55,500
Why are you getting so restless?

74
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,250
He wasn't paying up, so we brought these.

75
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,625
So what if he wasn't paying up?

76
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:03,000
He's an old customer.

77
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,833
We don't like giving credits.

78
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:07,958
Look at their attitude.

79
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:10,000
If we lose this client..

80
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,750
..then, we'll shove your attitude up your back.

81
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,000
Get that?

82
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,333
Stop staring.

83
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:19,333
Get back to work.

84
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:30,500
Rascal...first we slog all day..

85
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,125
..and then listen to their abuses.

86
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:35,375
We don't want this.

87
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:36,750
What else will you do?

88
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,625
I..

89
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:43,666
Will become a judge.

90
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:47,500
You want to be a judge?

91
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,500
Rascal...

92
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:53,541
Why did you hit us?

93
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:55,375
What else did you expect?

94
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:56,750
He wants to be a judge.

95
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,583
Do you know how hard one needs to study to become a judge?

96
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:01,416
I don't know about education.

97
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,583
But one should know how to fire a gun.

98
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:07,583
You..

99
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:14,916
Greetings, sir.

100
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:21,041
Why are you punishing me?

101
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:25,041
I've been legally acquitted.

102
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:33,833
The law is blindfolded..

103
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:36,875
..not me.

104
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:40,875
In my court, there's just one punishment..

105
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,500
..for raping a girl.

106
00:09:56,916 --> 00:10:02,791
Slice a cucumber...and rub some salt.

107
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:06,791
There's only one punishment...for such a crime.

108
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,541
Judge sir, the verdict's been given.

109
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:18,541
But...what section shall we charge him with?

110
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:28,416
Got it. Got it.

111
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:36,166
Hari, my mind's going numb.

112
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:37,875
I can't think of anything.

113
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:42,208
First of all, the administration slipped from my hands.

114
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:46,041
And that Bramhanand got you jailed.

115
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:49,583
Control this bloodshed.

116
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,750
Otherwise...your 7 year prison term..

117
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,833
..will turn into life imprisonment.

118
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:56,958
Why are you worried?

119
00:10:57,458 --> 00:11:02,583
These bars can contain me..

120
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:06,583
..not my reign.

121
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,625
What is it?

122
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:24,333
I need water to wash my face.

123
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:28,333
Come.

124
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,083
Are you done?

125
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:44,083
Then leave.

126
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:57,833
You haven't taken a bath yet.

127
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:00,583
You know Bablu's coming.

128
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:02,708
I am not asking you to marry him.

129
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:03,958
You just need to spend few hours with him.

130
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:07,958
Hurry up.

131
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:37,541
My master won the elections.

132
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:41,375
Now I will rule this place.

133
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:46,000
Let's see what that Bablu or anyone else can do about it.

134
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,500
Wretch, can't you do it properly?

135
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,916
Are your hands tied up?

136
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:54,916
Do you want a slap?

137
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,625
Hey...take that poster out!

138
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:03,166
Rascal.

139
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:07,166
Move.

140
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,708
Idiots, what did you think?

141
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:12,541
Just because Brahmanand won..

142
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:15,750
..you thought you could threaten us. - Bablu..

143
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,875
lower your voice.

144
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:19,916
No matter who controls the government..

145
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:23,916
..but, Bablu Chaudhary will always rule this place.

146
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:54,000
You did the right thing. He's a lowly man.

147
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,875
Listen carefully.

148
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:59,833
If you're not with Bablu Chaudhary..

149
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:01,500
..then consider yourself dead.

150
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,500
Get that.

151
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:13,791
He died too soon.

152
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:16,208
"I am from Patna."

153
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:18,541
"I am from Patna."

154
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:20,250
"I am from Patna."

155
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:23,375
"I am from Patna."

156
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:25,750
"I am from Patna."

157
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,166
"I am from Patna."

158
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:29,875
"I am from Patna."

159
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:32,750
"I am from Patna."

160
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:40,208
"I am a cannon ball... about to explode."

161
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:41,833
"I am from Patna."

162
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:45,000
"I am from Patna."

163
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,666
"I am from Patna."

164
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:50,666
"I am from Patna."

165
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,250
"No one dares to face me, because they're all afraid."

166
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:11,041
"My eyes are lethal, they always find their target."

167
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:13,500
"They are amazed."

168
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,875
"Bewildered."

169
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:20,583
"The entire town...by my grace."

170
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:23,125
"Take a chance."

171
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:25,500
"Cajole me."

172
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,208
"My grace has made everyone my slave."

173
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:37,791
"These cowards don't scare me."

174
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:39,500
"I am from Patna."

175
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,541
"I am from Patna."

176
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:44,208
"I am from Patna."

177
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:47,333
"I am from Patna."

178
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:49,041
"I am from Patna."

179
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:53,041
"I am from Patna."

180
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:08,625
"The pistol maybe local make, but the fire's real."

181
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:13,416
"Those who attack behind the back, are cowards."

182
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:15,833
"They die."

183
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:18,250
"They are scared."

184
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:23,041
"These goons try to protect my beauty."

185
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:25,416
"It's going crazy."

186
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:27,875
"It's falling."

187
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:32,625
"The prizes in the market, the traders are scared."

188
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:40,208
"I can deal with these thugs and goons alone."

189
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:41,875
"I am from Patna."

190
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:44,875
"I am from Patna."

191
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:46,583
"I am from Patna."

192
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:49,750
"I am from Patna."

193
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,500
"I am from Patna."

194
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,500
"I am from Patna."

195
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:19,333
Little twerps, You can hardly keep your pants up..

196
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:23,416
..and your blood's boiling already.

197
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:27,416
Get lost!

198
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,500
What's wrong?

199
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,166
Are you still upset about yesterday?

200
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:44,083
How dare he hit you?

201
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:45,500
Forget it.

202
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,375
When the time comes, we'll spare a bullet for him too.

203
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:53,500
By the way, Pali...were you showing attitude..

204
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:00,208
..for me or...for Guddi?

205
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:01,666
No, I didn't mean it.

206
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:03,500
I was joking, really?

207
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,166
You dare joke with me. - I was joking, really?

208
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:06,875
I'll show you.

209
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:08,708
Believe me. - Stop.

210
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:12,708
I won't spare you.

211
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:34,500
"May you always stay ahead.."

212
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,458
"..and your sagas follow you."

213
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:40,416
"Even if our paths are separate.."

214
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:43,416
"..but all I think about I you."

215
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:46,291
"Even if our destinations are different.."

216
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:49,125
"..but all I think about I you."

217
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:55,041
"Crossing all barriers...

218
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:59,041
...breaking every limit."

219
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:15,541
"My companion."

220
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:18,500
"You're my friend."

221
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,500
"Our bond is the most unique."

222
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:45,958
'Lord, what sin did I possible commit..'

223
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:49,375
'..that everyone treats me as a object of pleasure.'

224
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:55,458
'Is there no one who will accept me...wholeheartedly?'

225
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:57,166
I see.

226
00:20:57,666 --> 00:20:59,041
I've been slogging like a dog..

227
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:01,375
..while you're getting some eye-candy.

228
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:02,208
Great.

229
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:03,291
Tell me something.

230
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:05,208
How long will you keep staring at her secretly?

231
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:06,500
Why don't you go up to her and say something?

232
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,250
Otherwise you'll be watching her all your life.

233
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,125
Get lost.

234
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:12,375
You won't understand.

235
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:16,250
You'll know...once you find true love.

236
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,958
No, no, I'm not interested in finding true love.

237
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:21,958
Where one can never see the horizon, no matter how far you see.

238
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:23,166
Come on.

239
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:24,375
Get back to work.

240
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:25,208
Get back to work.

241
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:26,916
Come on.

242
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:31,333
How are you? - Fine.

243
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:35,250
Will it burst?

244
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,916
Will it burst?

245
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:45,250
This is a pistol...not a condom...which will burst.

246
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:50,000
I see... good going.

247
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,625
You could've warned us before firing.

248
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:55,125
Come on. Let's go.

249
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:57,208
You can collect your payment later.

250
00:21:57,708 --> 00:21:59,916
We don't give credits.

251
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:01,708
You dare ask us to pay.

252
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:02,500
Us.

253
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,416
Hey man...

254
00:22:05,916 --> 00:22:06,833
...pay up quietly..

255
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:09,666
..or else I'll blow your brains out.

256
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:11,416
Do you know who you're messing around with?

257
00:22:11,916 --> 00:22:17,666
If Bablu finds out, you'll be smoking without the gun.

258
00:22:18,166 --> 00:22:19,958
Don't talk like a fool.

259
00:22:20,458 --> 00:22:21,333
First save yourself.

260
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:22,166
Then you can worry about me.

261
00:22:22,666 --> 00:22:23,000
Understand.

262
00:22:23,500 --> 00:44:46,875
Now come on.

263
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:25,125
You'll regret this, I am warning you.

264
00:22:25,625 --> 00:22:29,125
Pay up. - Pay up.

265
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:40,416
Come on...pay up. - Cash?

266
00:23:40,916 --> 00:23:44,500
Yes. Keep all of it.

267
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,916
And the rest? - Rest?

268
00:23:48,416 --> 00:23:48,625
I paid you full.

269
00:23:49,125 --> 00:23:51,958
We wasted so many bullets on you and your thugs.

270
00:23:52,458 --> 00:23:53,500
Who's going to pay for that? You or your mum?

271
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:54,916
You mean I.. - Yes.

272
00:23:55,416 --> 00:23:57,833
Pay up, 2750 rupees.

273
00:23:58,333 --> 00:23:59,708
Keep it. Keep it all.

274
00:24:00,208 --> 00:24:03,708
Pali, this is 3000. - Keep it.

275
00:24:07,375 --> 00:24:09,208
Why are you still shooting at me?

276
00:24:09,708 --> 00:24:14,041
We didn't have change of 250.

277
00:24:14,541 --> 00:24:18,041
Well...see you.

278
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:23,625
You..

279
00:24:38,375 --> 00:24:41,708
Move.

280
00:24:42,208 --> 00:24:45,708
Hey my bangles..

281
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:53,458
I'll deal with you.

282
00:24:53,958 --> 00:24:57,458
I'll deal with you too.

283
00:25:04,625 --> 00:25:05,666
Thanks for saving our lives.

284
00:25:06,166 --> 00:25:07,833
You..

285
00:25:08,333 --> 00:25:10,333
Major.

286
00:25:10,833 --> 00:25:13,666
Major Suryakant Rathod.

287
00:25:14,166 --> 00:25:18,541
Seems like you've an old acquaintance...with pistols.

288
00:25:19,041 --> 00:25:19,666
How long have you been playing around with it?

289
00:25:20,166 --> 00:25:22,166
Since we were kids.

290
00:25:22,666 --> 00:25:26,208
We never got toys, so we played with them instead.

291
00:25:26,708 --> 00:25:28,375
I saw.

292
00:25:28,875 --> 00:25:31,458
You two are good shooters.

293
00:25:31,958 --> 00:25:33,625
But your aim's...

294
00:25:34,125 --> 00:25:35,041
...wrong.

295
00:25:35,541 --> 00:25:36,333
Meaning?

296
00:25:36,833 --> 00:25:40,708
Use your talent...for the country.

297
00:25:41,208 --> 00:25:45,333
Fame, fortune, money...you'll get it all.

298
00:25:45,833 --> 00:25:48,208
We already have that.

299
00:25:48,708 --> 00:25:51,500
We're famous all around Kanpur.

300
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,333
You can ask any criminal.

301
00:25:53,833 --> 00:25:55,333
He'll take our names with respect.

302
00:25:55,833 --> 00:25:58,250
And since we have this..

303
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:00,333
..we'll make fortune too.

304
00:26:00,833 --> 00:26:01,166
Yes.

305
00:26:01,666 --> 00:26:03,916
And as far as your favor's concerned.

306
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:06,000
We'll repay it soon.

307
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:11,208
We hate debts.

308
00:26:11,708 --> 00:26:15,208
Let's go, Pali. - Come on.

309
00:27:27,791 --> 00:27:29,333
They were all such loudmouths.

310
00:27:29,833 --> 00:27:31,375
But brother Pali showed them.

311
00:27:31,875 --> 00:27:33,500
You can't weave a quilt with thorns.

312
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,625
Brother Pali, he's right.

313
00:27:36,125 --> 00:27:41,083
You can't make soup from bones.

314
00:27:41,583 --> 00:27:43,708
Brother Gyani, eat slowly.

315
00:27:44,208 --> 00:27:44,791
Slowly.

316
00:27:45,291 --> 00:27:47,208
It's all yours.

317
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:50,208
No one's going to snatch it. - Hey!

318
00:27:50,708 --> 00:27:54,208
Never comment on food.

319
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,750
I spent my entire childhood starving.

320
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:04,208
I can't remember when the last time I ate properly was.

321
00:28:04,708 --> 00:28:08,791
Commenting on food.

322
00:28:09,291 --> 00:28:11,416
Rascal...

323
00:28:11,916 --> 00:28:15,083
...why are you worrying so much?

324
00:28:15,583 --> 00:28:17,375
There will be a day..

325
00:28:17,875 --> 00:28:19,416
..when all the delicious food in the world..

326
00:28:19,916 --> 00:28:22,166
..will be served before you.

327
00:28:22,666 --> 00:28:24,916
And you'll be wondering...

328
00:28:25,416 --> 00:28:28,291
...where do I start from?

329
00:28:28,791 --> 00:28:30,625
Brother Pali.

330
00:28:31,125 --> 00:28:32,833
Thank God I found you.

331
00:28:33,333 --> 00:28:34,666
What happened?

332
00:28:35,166 --> 00:28:35,500
Why are you panting?

333
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,333
Bablu's calling you.

334
00:28:37,833 --> 00:28:38,166
Why?

335
00:28:38,666 --> 00:28:39,333
I don't know.

336
00:28:39,833 --> 00:28:43,333
But I do know that he's furious.

337
00:28:48,041 --> 00:28:51,083
You won't say a word.

338
00:28:51,583 --> 00:28:53,416
I will talk to him.

339
00:28:53,916 --> 00:28:57,416
Let's go. - Yes.

340
00:29:03,333 --> 00:29:04,125
What's wrong?

341
00:29:04,625 --> 00:29:06,708
Why do you look so scared?

342
00:29:07,208 --> 00:29:08,541
As if I'm touching you for the first time.

343
00:29:09,041 --> 00:29:13,000
Or am I making you restless, darling?

344
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,041
Let me go. You're hurting me.

345
00:29:15,541 --> 00:29:19,041
Pain is the key to pleasure, sweetheart.

346
00:29:25,291 --> 00:29:28,791
Brother, those rascals are here.

347
00:29:34,583 --> 00:29:36,250
What's wrong?

348
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:39,416
What are you looking there for?

349
00:29:39,916 --> 00:29:42,375
You...

350
00:29:42,875 --> 00:29:46,375
Make me a drink.

351
00:29:47,791 --> 00:29:48,291
What?

352
00:29:48,791 --> 00:29:49,833
Just because you've outgrown your pants..

353
00:29:50,333 --> 00:29:51,875
..does it mean you can do as you want?

354
00:29:52,375 --> 00:29:52,875
You dare threaten my man.

355
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:55,750
Move back.

356
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:57,083
Lower your eyes.

357
00:29:57,583 --> 00:29:58,250
Lower your eyes.

358
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:03,291
Rascal, you want to be like me.

359
00:30:03,791 --> 00:30:04,958
Listen to me.

360
00:30:05,458 --> 00:30:05,750
What do should I listen?

361
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:07,333
This wasn't our fault.

362
00:30:07,833 --> 00:30:11,333
So, what is my fault?

363
00:30:27,541 --> 00:30:30,375
Rascal, how dare you try to shoot my brother!

364
00:30:30,875 --> 00:30:34,125
My brother!

365
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:37,458
We were just kids back then.

366
00:30:37,958 --> 00:30:41,458
But I won't endure it anymore.

367
00:30:47,291 --> 00:30:54,666
Everything stays the way it has been so far.

368
00:30:55,166 --> 00:30:59,416
But...we'll be giving the commands.

369
00:30:59,916 --> 00:31:02,916
If anyone has a problem..

370
00:31:03,416 --> 00:31:05,375
..he'll meet the same fate as Bablu.

371
00:31:05,875 --> 00:31:07,500
Now disappear.

372
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:08,666
Come on.

373
00:31:09,166 --> 00:31:09,916
Let's go.

374
00:31:10,416 --> 00:31:12,333
Or else he'll shoot us too.

375
00:31:12,833 --> 00:31:16,333
You...please stay here.

376
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:27,625
Tell her...

377
00:31:28,125 --> 00:31:31,625
...about your feelings today.

378
00:31:39,375 --> 00:31:43,208
Please look at me.

379
00:31:43,708 --> 00:31:47,208
I've loved you since I was a kid.

380
00:31:47,708 --> 00:31:54,416
If you...don't see the love in my eyes..

381
00:31:54,916 --> 00:31:58,666
Then you can shoot me.

382
00:31:59,166 --> 00:32:02,833
Or you can come to me..

383
00:32:03,333 --> 00:32:14,875
"There's a veil that's taunting me."

384
00:32:15,375 --> 00:32:18,875
"That's taunting me.."

385
00:32:26,625 --> 00:32:38,291
"When my lips tremble and hesitate...I realized."

386
00:32:38,791 --> 00:32:42,291
"I realized."

387
00:32:50,333 --> 00:32:55,041
"My freedom's turned into captivity."

388
00:32:55,541 --> 00:33:01,666
"My sweetheart...you're my benefactor."

389
00:33:02,166 --> 00:33:06,791
"My freedom's turned into captivity."

390
00:33:07,291 --> 00:33:13,375
"My sweetheart...you're my benefactor."

391
00:33:13,875 --> 00:33:19,291
"My sweetheart...you're my benefactor."

392
00:33:19,791 --> 00:33:24,333
"Has the mirror changed, or have I turned new?"

393
00:33:24,833 --> 00:33:30,958
"My sweetheart...you're my benefactor."

394
00:33:31,458 --> 00:33:40,125
"My sweetheart...you're my benefactor."

395
00:33:40,625 --> 00:33:44,125
"You're my benefactor."

396
00:34:20,041 --> 00:34:23,541
Yes, sir.

397
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:33,166
Minister's on the line.

398
00:34:33,666 --> 00:34:35,541
You're working really hard for your age, Shukla.

399
00:34:36,041 --> 00:34:36,666
Yes, sir.

400
00:34:37,166 --> 00:34:38,000
Greetings, sir.

401
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,250
Bless you, Hari.

402
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:41,708
Where are you?

403
00:34:42,208 --> 00:34:44,833
It's quite a task finding you.

404
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:47,500
You're my Guru, sir.

405
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,791
It doesn't suit you to say such things.

406
00:34:50,291 --> 00:34:53,500
Listen, I've arranged for your release.

407
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,250
Why?

408
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:56,666
Are the elections close?

409
00:34:57,166 --> 00:34:58,458
Yes.

410
00:34:58,958 --> 00:35:02,125
And leave no stone unturned in this election.

411
00:35:02,625 --> 00:35:04,458
Just give the word.

412
00:35:04,958 --> 00:35:06,750
I'm always ready to do my duty.

413
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:08,375
But pay some attention to me too.

414
00:35:08,875 --> 00:35:09,958
What is it?

415
00:35:10,458 --> 00:35:13,833
I'm done with bloodshed.

416
00:35:14,333 --> 00:35:17,750
Now, I want to enter politics.

417
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:21,500
Yes. And you've served enough time in prison.

418
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,625
Prepare for the elections.

419
00:35:24,125 --> 00:35:25,833
I'll announce your name.

420
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:29,791
Hail Lord. - Hail Lord!

421
00:35:30,291 --> 00:35:32,458
Shaukal.

422
00:35:32,958 --> 00:35:34,708
Yes, sir.

423
00:35:35,208 --> 00:35:35,291
Thank you.

424
00:35:35,791 --> 00:35:38,208
I am a devotee of Lord Mahadev as well.

425
00:35:38,708 --> 00:35:42,208
Hello.

426
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:46,125
Sir...Ballu's been shot.

427
00:35:46,625 --> 00:35:50,125
He was murdered.

428
00:35:53,125 --> 00:35:54,666
Shaukal.

429
00:35:55,166 --> 00:35:55,500
Yes.

430
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,958
What's wrong, sir?

431
00:35:59,458 --> 00:36:00,833
Get lost.

432
00:36:01,333 --> 00:36:02,500
Let's go.

433
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,500
My job's..

434
00:36:12,291 --> 00:36:13,791
Yes, sir.

435
00:36:14,291 --> 00:36:17,333
Hand me your gun. - Sir it's my service weapon.

436
00:36:17,833 --> 00:36:19,958
I'm talking to you, hand me your gun.

437
00:36:20,458 --> 00:36:22,208
Try to understand, it's my service weapon.

438
00:36:22,708 --> 00:36:24,333
I am the government.

439
00:36:24,833 --> 00:36:27,125
Hand me the gun!

440
00:36:27,625 --> 00:36:28,791
Here you go.

441
00:36:29,291 --> 00:36:29,708
Let's go.

442
00:36:30,208 --> 00:36:33,708
Sir, please be careful.

443
00:36:42,583 --> 00:36:46,083
Which one is Pali?

444
00:36:51,208 --> 00:36:51,291
Greetings.

445
00:36:51,791 --> 00:36:55,291
I'm the pali..

446
00:37:01,708 --> 00:37:07,041
I want to fill your brains with bullets. Now!

447
00:37:07,541 --> 00:37:11,041
But I won't kill you so easily.

448
00:37:16,541 --> 00:37:18,375
Forgive him.

449
00:37:18,875 --> 00:37:20,916
He will definitely die.

450
00:37:21,416 --> 00:37:22,000
Get lost.

451
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,333
Then kill me first..

452
00:37:23,833 --> 00:37:27,333
Then die.

453
00:37:47,791 --> 00:37:50,500
What happened?

454
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,458
What's wrong with you goons now?

455
00:37:53,958 --> 00:37:56,000
Trying to boss around after killing my man.

456
00:37:56,500 --> 00:38:00,541
If you're really brave, then hit me.

457
00:38:01,041 --> 00:38:02,083
Hit me.

458
00:38:02,583 --> 00:38:07,083
We would rather die, then hit you.

459
00:38:07,583 --> 00:38:12,750
Why? Am I your father? - God.

460
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:15,708
You're our God!

461
00:38:16,208 --> 00:38:21,500
We've your picture in our temple, instead of God's.

462
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,500
Look.

463
00:38:27,458 --> 00:38:30,250
We've always revered you since childhood.

464
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:33,041
If I am your God..

465
00:38:33,541 --> 00:38:35,291
..then why kill my right-hand man, Bablu?

466
00:38:35,791 --> 00:38:39,208
The one he's been bothering for years, was special to me.

467
00:38:39,708 --> 00:38:40,125
Who?

468
00:38:40,625 --> 00:38:44,125
Guddi.

469
00:38:45,666 --> 00:38:47,708
I endured as long as I could.

470
00:38:48,208 --> 00:38:50,291
When I couldn't, I shot him.

471
00:38:50,791 --> 00:38:55,166
You can punish us in any way you want, we're ready.

472
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:56,541
What do you want?

473
00:38:57,041 --> 00:39:00,208
To rule the underworld.

474
00:39:00,708 --> 00:39:02,916
Can you prove it? - Of course.

475
00:39:03,416 --> 00:39:07,750
Fine, now you two will do..

476
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:09,166
..Bablu's job.

477
00:39:09,666 --> 00:39:14,875
But remember, in reward I give life..

478
00:39:15,375 --> 00:39:18,875
..and as punishment, I take it.

479
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:32,750
"Sweetheart..."

480
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:36,750
"Sweetheart said to me..."

481
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:39,166
Uncle, work faster.

482
00:39:39,666 --> 00:39:41,041
Pali and Gyaani must be on their way to collect the goods.

483
00:39:41,541 --> 00:39:42,916
Fine, I'm working faster.

484
00:39:43,416 --> 00:39:45,083
Salim, hurry up.

485
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:49,083
Yes, uncle. I am hurrying up.

486
00:39:53,625 --> 00:39:54,250
Don't let anyone escape.

487
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:56,166
Arrest everyone.

488
00:39:56,666 --> 00:39:57,958
No one goes out. - Stop.

489
00:39:58,458 --> 00:39:59,916
Don't let anyone out.

490
00:40:00,416 --> 00:40:01,208
Arrest everyone.

491
00:40:01,708 --> 00:40:04,041
Come out.

492
00:40:04,541 --> 00:40:05,291
Seize the weapons.

493
00:40:05,791 --> 00:40:07,541
Don't hit us. We'll do as you say.

494
00:40:08,041 --> 00:40:09,791
Arrest everyone.

495
00:40:10,291 --> 00:40:13,958
Come.

496
00:40:14,458 --> 00:40:15,291
Police. Police.

497
00:40:15,791 --> 00:40:16,041
Run.

498
00:40:16,541 --> 00:40:19,958
Come on.

499
00:40:20,458 --> 00:40:22,000
Go inside.

500
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,750
How will we deliver the goods? - Stay calm.

501
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:26,958
Stay calm. - Go inside.

502
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:28,166
Get everyone in.

503
00:40:28,666 --> 00:40:29,208
Go inside.

504
00:40:29,708 --> 00:40:30,500
Him too.

505
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,500
Let's get to the police station, and I'll show you.

506
00:40:39,916 --> 00:40:43,416
We'll have to do something.

507
00:40:54,291 --> 00:40:54,791
What happened, Rafiq?

508
00:40:55,291 --> 00:40:56,208
Why are you panting?

509
00:40:56,708 --> 00:40:59,083
The police just conducted a raid. - What?

510
00:40:59,583 --> 00:41:02,916
They raided all our pistol-workshops.

511
00:41:03,416 --> 00:41:05,166
Arrested many of our people.

512
00:41:05,666 --> 00:41:07,708
Who's the officer eager to attain martyrdom?

513
00:41:08,208 --> 00:41:09,291
It's the new SP.

514
00:41:09,791 --> 00:41:10,958
The rascal believes in honesty.

515
00:41:11,458 --> 00:41:13,541
I even called the Commissioner.

516
00:41:14,041 --> 00:41:15,291
But no one wants to interfere in this matter.

517
00:41:15,791 --> 00:41:19,041
Hari, how will we handle this mess now?

518
00:41:19,541 --> 00:41:21,750
My brain's gone numb.

519
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:23,958
You're my Guru.

520
00:41:24,458 --> 00:41:27,750
It doesn't suit you if your brain goes numb all the time.

521
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:29,583
If Bablu had been alive..

522
00:41:30,083 --> 00:41:31,458
..we would've never faced such a situation.

523
00:41:31,958 --> 00:41:35,458
Greetings, Judge sir.

524
00:41:40,333 --> 00:41:43,291
The job's done.

525
00:41:43,791 --> 00:41:46,458
Job's done? What job?

526
00:41:46,958 --> 00:41:47,666
Police seized all the goods. - Hey!

527
00:41:48,166 --> 00:41:50,000
What job? - Shut up.

528
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:52,666
Let us speak.

529
00:41:53,166 --> 00:41:56,666
Come, sir.

530
00:42:14,875 --> 00:42:16,375
Why bring this dung here?

531
00:42:16,875 --> 00:42:17,541
Do you want to butter it?

532
00:42:18,041 --> 00:42:21,541
Be patient.

533
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:36,083
Amazing.

534
00:42:36,583 --> 00:42:40,083
Hari, finally my brain's calm.

535
00:42:45,333 --> 00:42:52,666
"Those who were to seek have plunged deep."

536
00:42:53,166 --> 00:42:56,666
"I like an old man fearfully sat beside riverbed."

537
00:43:04,291 --> 00:43:07,791
Great!

538
00:44:08,916 --> 00:44:09,916
What's all this?

539
00:44:10,416 --> 00:44:11,708
Move back. Move.

540
00:44:12,208 --> 00:44:13,500
What's this? What are you doing?

541
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,083
Get out. Everyone.

542
00:44:15,583 --> 00:44:17,041
Get out.

543
00:44:17,541 --> 00:44:18,583
Get out.

544
00:44:19,083 --> 00:44:21,166
You can change the country later.

545
00:44:21,666 --> 00:44:25,166
Here you go, start.

546
00:44:32,416 --> 00:44:33,666
Glory to you!

547
00:44:34,166 --> 00:44:35,333
Glory to you!

548
00:44:35,833 --> 00:44:37,208
Glory to you!

549
00:44:37,708 --> 00:44:38,708
Glory to you!

550
00:44:39,208 --> 00:44:40,500
Glory to you!

551
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,250
Glory to you!

552
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:45,250
Mahadev!

553
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:46,875
Stop. Stop!

554
00:44:47,375 --> 00:44:50,000
Stop the car.

555
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:52,750
Get out of here. Get out.

556
00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:54,833
No one's going to vote here.

557
00:44:55,333 --> 00:44:56,041
What's this charade?

558
00:44:56,541 --> 00:44:57,416
I'll shoot you.

559
00:44:57,916 --> 00:44:59,458
There'll be no booth capturing as long as I am here.

560
00:44:59,958 --> 00:45:03,958
We'll capture this booth in your presence.

561
00:45:04,458 --> 00:45:05,041
18x5 is 90.

562
00:45:05,541 --> 00:45:09,041
Come on, seize the booths.

563
00:45:32,041 --> 00:45:33,541
Phulchand, get me something sweet, quickly.

564
00:45:34,041 --> 00:45:37,541
Right away, sir.

565
00:45:44,291 --> 00:45:46,291
What do you think policemen are?

566
00:45:46,791 --> 00:45:49,041
Something you can rattle as you like.

567
00:45:49,541 --> 00:45:53,333
Now I'll thrash you two to bits.

568
00:45:53,833 --> 00:45:55,416
You dare kill a police officer.

569
00:45:55,916 --> 00:45:57,833
How dare you?

570
00:45:58,333 --> 00:46:01,500
We've told you before that we didn't kill him.

571
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:07,041
So tell me who did.

572
00:46:07,541 --> 00:46:11,208
Otherwise, you'll spend the rest of your life in jail.

573
00:46:11,708 --> 00:46:15,166
You will set us free tomorrow morning.

574
00:46:15,666 --> 00:46:16,541
Respectfully.

575
00:46:17,041 --> 00:46:19,708
Oh my.

576
00:46:20,208 --> 00:46:21,625
This is what you call, Life's all messed up.

577
00:46:22,125 --> 00:46:24,416
But you still got pride.

578
00:46:24,916 --> 00:46:28,541
But you see, son, dreams don't really come true.

579
00:46:29,041 --> 00:46:30,375
Do you know who we work for?

580
00:46:30,875 --> 00:46:31,375
Yes, I know.

581
00:46:31,875 --> 00:46:32,791
Constable Mewaram informed me..

582
00:46:33,291 --> 00:46:37,458
..that you two work for Gabbar Singh.

583
00:46:37,958 --> 00:46:40,333
But you two don't know..

584
00:46:40,833 --> 00:46:43,583
..that man you're so arrogant about..

585
00:46:44,083 --> 00:46:46,500
..is in Delhi right now.

586
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,500
And by the time he finds out..

587
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,291
..Raghavendra Singh Chauhan will close your files.

588
00:46:52,791 --> 00:46:56,583
End of news!

589
00:46:57,083 --> 00:46:59,666
You two have until tomorrow evening.

590
00:47:00,166 --> 00:47:02,458
Admit to your crimes, otherwise..

591
00:47:02,958 --> 00:47:06,583
Sir, what about their food?

592
00:47:07,083 --> 00:47:09,000
These two won't get food.

593
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:13,000
All they will get are bullets.

594
00:47:25,708 --> 00:47:28,375
Pali. - Yes.

595
00:47:28,875 --> 00:47:32,375
Look.

596
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:43,750
Mewaram, release those two.

597
00:47:52,041 --> 00:47:54,541
Don't think too hard.

598
00:47:55,041 --> 00:47:57,708
I did what I thought was right.

599
00:47:58,208 --> 00:48:01,708
Now you can do...what you feel is right.

600
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,208
The election committee has cancelled..

601
00:48:11,708 --> 00:48:14,750
..some of the votes cast in the Kanpur, Shuklaganj region.

602
00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:18,208
According to the police, Harishankar Tripathi's goons..

603
00:48:18,708 --> 00:48:20,083
..had forcefully seized these polling booths.

604
00:48:20,583 --> 00:48:23,083
It's believe that, this is the same polling booth..

605
00:48:23,583 --> 00:48:27,416
..where police officer Satbeer Adhikari was murdered.

606
00:48:27,916 --> 00:48:30,916
You look more worried than me.

607
00:48:31,416 --> 00:48:35,250
We won't lose if few votes are cancelled.

608
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:36,375
The only difference is..

609
00:48:36,875 --> 00:48:37,875
..earlier we used to win by 125,000 votes..

610
00:48:38,375 --> 00:48:39,166
..but this time we'll win with 100,000 votes.

611
00:48:39,666 --> 00:48:40,083
Yes.

612
00:48:40,583 --> 00:48:46,791
So...Hail Mahadev. - Hail Mahadev.

613
00:48:47,291 --> 00:48:47,541
He isn't answering.

614
00:48:48,041 --> 00:48:48,875
Everyone staring at you?

615
00:48:49,375 --> 00:48:51,666
What are you doing? - He's rebuking at me.

616
00:48:52,166 --> 00:48:53,541
Why aren't you answering our phone?

617
00:48:54,041 --> 00:48:54,833
Did you shove it up your back?

618
00:48:55,333 --> 00:48:56,833
Are you two stupid?

619
00:48:57,333 --> 00:48:59,833
I've been disconnecting your calls, but you still keep calling.

620
00:49:00,333 --> 00:49:01,875
Rascal, we've been waiting for over an hour.

621
00:49:02,375 --> 00:49:02,916
So what?

622
00:49:03,416 --> 00:49:04,291
You're not doing me a favor.

623
00:49:04,791 --> 00:49:06,041
I didn't call you here.

624
00:49:06,541 --> 00:49:07,833
Hey, don't make me furious.

625
00:49:08,333 --> 00:49:09,708
We came here to meet sir, and we'll meet him.

626
00:49:10,208 --> 00:49:12,208
Look, you'll be called if required.

627
00:49:12,708 --> 00:49:14,208
And you won't die, if you don't come here.

628
00:49:14,708 --> 00:49:15,625
The police would've killed us..

629
00:49:16,125 --> 00:49:19,083
..if that man hadn't saved us.

630
00:49:19,583 --> 00:49:20,375
Right.

631
00:49:20,875 --> 00:49:23,916
You should've saved us instead. - Why?

632
00:49:24,416 --> 00:49:25,541
You're not my responsibility.

633
00:49:26,041 --> 00:49:26,583
I've other things to do.

634
00:49:27,083 --> 00:49:28,583
Get lost.

635
00:49:29,083 --> 00:49:29,750
Hey...

636
00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:32,208
Don't try to act too smart.

637
00:49:32,708 --> 00:49:36,250
Otherwise...I'll shoot you, and call it an encounter.

638
00:49:36,750 --> 00:49:39,625
Rascal, we spent one bullet on Bablu.

639
00:49:40,125 --> 00:49:42,500
We'll spend two on you.

640
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,666
One from the front...and other on your back.

641
00:49:46,166 --> 00:49:47,708
Hey...get lost.

642
00:49:48,208 --> 00:49:49,583
Get going. - Let's go, Pali.

643
00:49:50,083 --> 00:49:53,583
Get lost.

644
00:50:09,208 --> 00:50:12,500
Oh, my!

645
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Pali...

646
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:19,000
...where are we?

647
00:50:21,541 --> 00:50:25,041
Hey, mister. What do you want?

648
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:31,000
Who do you want to meet? - We're here to see the Major.

649
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:33,916
Major? - Yes.

650
00:50:34,416 --> 00:50:35,166
Uncle. - Yes.

651
00:50:35,666 --> 00:50:37,041
Let them come.

652
00:50:37,541 --> 00:50:41,041
Heard that. - Go on.

653
00:50:45,541 --> 00:50:46,791
Uncle. - Yes.

654
00:50:47,291 --> 00:50:50,791
Prepare a room for them, please. - Yes, sir.

655
00:50:54,208 --> 00:50:57,833
Good, nice to see you two here.

656
00:50:58,333 --> 00:51:01,166
Proves that you still have some humanity..

657
00:51:01,666 --> 00:51:04,625
..and a will to live a better life.

658
00:51:05,125 --> 00:51:05,958
You two must be tired.

659
00:51:06,458 --> 00:51:09,958
Get some rest. See you tomorrow.

660
00:51:35,666 --> 00:51:38,916
What the...

661
00:51:39,416 --> 00:51:41,833
Yes...nice guns.

662
00:51:42,333 --> 00:51:44,041
I see, we've to make these.

663
00:51:44,541 --> 00:51:45,458
It'll be done, Major.

664
00:51:45,958 --> 00:51:48,833
Yes, just leave the box behind.

665
00:51:49,333 --> 00:51:52,291
These are the best pistols in the world.

666
00:51:52,791 --> 00:51:56,958
Used only...by professional shooter.

667
00:51:57,458 --> 00:52:00,791
Major, why tell us about it?

668
00:52:01,291 --> 00:52:03,000
Because...they'll be useful..

669
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:05,625
..in your journey ahead.

670
00:52:06,125 --> 00:52:07,458
Journey?

671
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:08,625
But what do we have to do?

672
00:52:09,125 --> 00:52:12,875
Relax. You'll know when the time comes.

673
00:52:13,375 --> 00:52:17,833
For now, watch carefully what I do.

674
00:52:18,333 --> 00:52:20,000
Excuse me.

675
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:22,208
Come.

676
00:52:22,708 --> 00:52:24,833
The gun should always be facing down.

677
00:52:25,333 --> 00:52:27,458
Always this way, not this.

678
00:52:27,958 --> 00:52:31,041
Feet...at a comfortable distance.

679
00:52:31,541 --> 00:52:32,625
Shoulders straight.

680
00:52:33,125 --> 00:52:35,083
Look up...head straight.

681
00:52:35,583 --> 00:52:38,375
You can keep your hand wherever you like.

682
00:52:38,875 --> 00:52:42,583
You should see the target through this.

683
00:52:43,083 --> 00:52:45,833
Okay? Got it.

684
00:52:46,333 --> 00:52:49,833
Come on.

685
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:57,000
These are your pistols?

686
00:52:59,375 --> 00:53:01,666
You just need to take aim for now.

687
00:53:02,166 --> 00:53:05,666
Not shoot.

688
00:53:32,916 --> 00:53:34,083
Major...

689
00:53:34,583 --> 00:53:35,583
...what are you making us do?

690
00:53:36,083 --> 00:53:38,250
This will jam us.

691
00:53:38,750 --> 00:53:41,000
Just tell us where we need to aim.

692
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:42,708
Leave the rest to us.

693
00:53:43,208 --> 00:53:46,708
Just.. - Brother.

694
00:54:15,708 --> 00:54:16,750
What happened?

695
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:21,833
Are these two the shooters you were talking about?

696
00:54:22,333 --> 00:54:24,333
Brother, why are you pretending to be so ignorant?

697
00:54:24,833 --> 00:54:27,333
They can't even hold a gun properly.

698
00:54:27,833 --> 00:54:28,833
You think they can aim.

699
00:54:29,333 --> 00:54:32,833
Why don't you show us how?

700
00:54:42,958 --> 00:54:46,458
Move.

701
00:55:22,708 --> 00:55:27,500
It takes time to adjust to anything.

702
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:32,625
These pistols are still new for you.

703
00:55:33,125 --> 00:55:34,833
First adjust yourselves to it.

704
00:55:35,333 --> 00:55:40,250
Then you'll be able to aim properly.

705
00:55:40,750 --> 00:55:44,250
Now do as I said, come on.

706
00:56:33,583 --> 00:56:35,583
You have no clue how good they are.

707
00:56:36,083 --> 00:56:37,041
Give me one chance.

708
00:56:37,541 --> 00:56:38,083
One chance.

709
00:56:38,583 --> 00:56:40,708
And watch what I turn them into.

710
00:56:41,208 --> 00:56:44,666
Brother, you can change their looks, not their fate.

711
00:56:45,166 --> 00:56:48,666
Bet? - Bet.

712
00:56:50,375 --> 00:56:53,500
From one confinement into another.

713
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,666
The only difference is, earlier we were in hell..

714
00:56:57,166 --> 00:56:59,875
..and now he's making our lives hell.

715
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:01,666
Are you listening?

716
00:57:02,166 --> 00:57:05,666
Hey.

717
00:57:06,916 --> 00:57:08,583
What are you saying, Pali?

718
00:57:09,083 --> 00:57:10,958
Back there, we would've definitely ended in hell.

719
00:57:11,458 --> 00:57:12,500
But here...

720
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:16,500
...we get to start a new life.

721
00:57:27,375 --> 00:57:29,833
Hey, Gyani.

722
00:57:30,333 --> 00:57:33,291
Gyani.

723
00:57:33,791 --> 00:57:39,791
After we leave, even we'll make stuff like these.

724
00:57:40,291 --> 00:57:45,833
Chimanganj, Cooliebazaar, all of Bhusatoli...and the old town.

725
00:57:46,333 --> 00:57:49,833
They will all be shocked.

726
00:57:55,208 --> 00:57:57,125
She's coming.

727
00:57:57,625 --> 00:57:58,458
What are you saying?

728
00:57:58,958 --> 00:58:03,000
Look, Pali. Major said stomach in and aim straight.

729
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:05,708
Close one eye and..

730
00:58:06,208 --> 00:58:07,916
Paridhi.

731
00:58:08,416 --> 00:58:09,541
When did you come?

732
00:58:10,041 --> 00:58:11,791
Actually, when we're shooting..

733
00:58:12,291 --> 00:58:16,041
..we don't know what's going on around us.

734
00:58:16,541 --> 00:58:20,125
That's why we didn't realize you're coming.

735
00:58:20,625 --> 00:58:22,333
And anyway, your brother..

736
00:58:22,833 --> 00:58:25,208
I mean, the Major always says..

737
00:58:25,708 --> 00:58:31,750
..a good shooter never lets his mind deviate..

738
00:58:32,250 --> 00:58:33,541
..stays focus and shoots.

739
00:58:34,041 --> 00:58:35,041
Are you done? - Yes.

740
00:58:35,541 --> 00:58:38,416
Now listen...brother isn't at home.

741
00:58:38,916 --> 00:58:42,291
I see. - So you two can get lost as soon as you can.

742
00:58:42,791 --> 00:58:44,500
Because this is not your cup of tea.

743
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,541
And I know this is brother's first mistake.

744
00:58:48,041 --> 00:58:50,541
So get out of here.

745
00:58:51,041 --> 00:58:54,541
Understand?

746
00:59:16,291 --> 00:59:19,791
Fire!

747
00:59:24,208 --> 00:59:26,833
Good.

748
00:59:27,333 --> 00:59:30,458
Fire!

749
00:59:30,958 --> 00:59:32,000
Good!

750
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:36,000
Very good!

751
00:59:38,791 --> 00:59:43,625
Now...I would like to call upon..

752
00:59:44,125 --> 00:59:47,000
..the new fearless leader of my party, Mr. Harishankar Tripathi..

753
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:51,000
..who will address you all.

754
01:00:01,416 --> 01:00:02,291
Har Har Mahadev!

755
01:00:02,791 --> 01:00:04,708
Har Har Mahadev!

756
01:00:05,208 --> 01:00:08,875
I've always considered everyone as my kin.

757
01:00:09,375 --> 01:00:11,958
By making me victorious..

758
01:00:12,458 --> 01:00:17,291
..you've proven that you've the same feelings for me.

759
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:22,791
And I am deeply indebted to all of you for it.

760
01:00:23,291 --> 01:00:26,416
I promise...

761
01:00:26,916 --> 01:00:30,416
...that I will always meet your expectations.

762
01:00:36,875 --> 01:00:42,750
Actually, I want my reign to be peaceful, like Lord Ram.

763
01:00:43,250 --> 01:00:46,500
But if required..

764
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:56,041
..I can wage war like Lord Krishna to annihilate evil.

765
01:00:56,541 --> 01:00:58,291
Har Har Mahadev!

766
01:00:58,791 --> 01:01:00,375
Har Har Mahadev!

767
01:01:00,875 --> 01:01:01,666
Har Har Mahadev!

768
01:01:02,166 --> 01:01:04,583
Har Har Mahadev!

769
01:01:05,083 --> 01:01:07,500
Har Har Mahadev!

770
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:11,500
Come, Hari.

771
01:01:15,041 --> 01:01:18,708
Call Pali, Gyani.

772
01:01:19,208 --> 01:01:23,000
Just give the orders, sir, I am there.

773
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:26,541
Polls are over, Rafiq.

774
01:01:27,041 --> 01:01:30,541
Now we rule with an iron fist.

775
01:01:40,708 --> 01:01:43,166
Don't be surprised.

776
01:01:43,666 --> 01:01:47,541
Surprise the world.

777
01:01:48,041 --> 01:01:50,083
What are you thinking?

778
01:01:50,583 --> 01:01:54,083
Come on.

779
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,291
Superb. Wonderful.

780
01:02:33,791 --> 01:02:37,291
Very good.

781
01:02:39,875 --> 01:02:42,666
Superb. Very good.

782
01:02:43,166 --> 01:02:45,833
You two will go to Lucknow with me.

783
01:02:46,333 --> 01:02:47,541
Lucknow?

784
01:02:48,041 --> 01:02:48,083
What for?

785
01:02:48,583 --> 01:02:51,541
For the State Shooting Championship.

786
01:02:52,041 --> 01:02:52,875
Where you two..

787
01:02:53,375 --> 01:02:55,458
..will face the best shooters of the state.

788
01:02:55,958 --> 01:02:57,875
But I've no doubt that you guys are the best.

789
01:02:58,375 --> 01:03:00,583
You're better than all of them.

790
01:03:01,083 --> 01:03:03,333
This championship will change the meaning of your life.

791
01:03:03,833 --> 01:03:07,333
Trust me.

792
01:03:10,333 --> 01:03:10,833
Any questions?

793
01:03:11,333 --> 01:03:11,541
Any doubt?

794
01:03:12,041 --> 01:03:14,166
No.

795
01:03:14,666 --> 01:03:16,000
Consider it done.

796
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:17,291
Good.

797
01:03:17,791 --> 01:03:20,083
Take rest. We'll meet again.

798
01:03:20,583 --> 01:03:20,875
Come.

799
01:03:21,375 --> 01:03:22,166
Told you they're the best.

800
01:03:22,666 --> 01:03:26,916
So...what's wrong?

801
01:03:27,416 --> 01:03:29,875
I never imagined life will bring us here.

802
01:03:30,375 --> 01:03:32,625
I mean...imagine where we started, and where we are.

803
01:03:33,125 --> 01:03:35,291
We'll just shoot and have fun.

804
01:03:35,791 --> 01:03:38,833
Right, Pali!

805
01:03:39,333 --> 01:03:39,916
Where are you two?

806
01:03:40,416 --> 01:03:42,666
Judge sir.

807
01:03:43,166 --> 01:03:43,458
You two just disappeared.

808
01:03:43,958 --> 01:03:49,625
Sir, we did come to see you, but..

809
01:03:50,125 --> 01:03:52,375
Rafiq didn't let us.

810
01:03:52,875 --> 01:03:54,583
Didn't let you meet me?

811
01:03:55,083 --> 01:03:57,000
You were busy, in a meeting with Jwala.

812
01:03:57,500 --> 01:04:01,000
You could've told me after the meeting.

813
01:04:03,375 --> 01:04:07,166
It's time to fulfill your dreams.

814
01:04:07,666 --> 01:04:11,166
Come with me.

815
01:04:14,916 --> 01:04:16,208
What's wrong?

816
01:04:16,708 --> 01:04:17,625
What are you thinking?

817
01:04:18,125 --> 01:04:20,541
Let's go. - Go where?

818
01:04:21,041 --> 01:04:22,791
And what about the promise we made to the Major?

819
01:04:23,291 --> 01:04:28,500
Gyani, we aren't born to shoot at target-posts.

820
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:32,041
Our Lord is calling us.

821
01:04:32,541 --> 01:04:35,458
Wasn't that our dream?

822
01:04:35,958 --> 01:04:37,458
We've just one chance.

823
01:04:37,958 --> 01:04:41,500
If we lose this, Gyani...

824
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:45,208
...then everything will be over.

825
01:04:45,708 --> 01:04:50,291
And if I go with you..

826
01:04:50,791 --> 01:04:54,291
..I won't be able to live.

827
01:06:06,458 --> 01:06:07,250
What are you still doing here?

828
01:06:07,750 --> 01:06:09,791
Why don't you leave, like your friend?. - Paridhi

829
01:06:10,291 --> 01:06:13,708
He could've left...if he wanted.

830
01:06:14,208 --> 01:06:17,291
Brother, you still trust him. - Calm down.

831
01:06:17,791 --> 01:06:22,125
He's still here, this proves that he's trustworthy.

832
01:06:22,625 --> 01:06:23,833
You calm down.

833
01:06:24,333 --> 01:06:26,291
I'll handle it.

834
01:06:26,791 --> 01:06:30,291
It's okay.

835
01:06:36,291 --> 01:06:37,708
Gyani.

836
01:06:38,208 --> 01:06:44,500
I am really sorry... for rebuking at you.

837
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:48,583
Please forgive me.

838
01:06:49,083 --> 01:06:52,791
Please, I am really sorry.

839
01:06:53,291 --> 01:06:56,791
Please.

840
01:07:03,166 --> 01:07:09,208
"The sky and the earth...are meeting at the horizon."

841
01:07:09,708 --> 01:07:15,458
"The colors of joys are flying around."

842
01:07:15,958 --> 01:07:18,750
"A fistful of sunlight."

843
01:07:19,250 --> 01:07:21,916
"A reflection of desires."

844
01:07:22,416 --> 01:07:31,750
"Life is unveiling itself."

845
01:07:32,250 --> 01:07:34,958
"The significance of love's changing.."

846
01:07:35,458 --> 01:07:37,916
"..it's season of union again."

847
01:07:38,416 --> 01:07:44,250
"It's pouring...from the sky.."

848
01:07:44,750 --> 01:07:50,166
"..the new meaning of love."

849
01:07:50,666 --> 01:07:53,500
"May Lord make love make immortal."

850
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,708
"The grace of God.."

851
01:07:57,208 --> 01:07:59,875
"It's just you."

852
01:08:00,375 --> 01:08:01,458
"It's just you."

853
01:08:01,958 --> 01:08:03,166
"It's just you."

854
01:08:03,666 --> 01:08:06,250
"Only you."

855
01:08:06,750 --> 01:08:07,958
"It's just you."

856
01:08:08,458 --> 01:08:09,500
"It's just you."

857
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:13,500
"Only you."

858
01:08:26,625 --> 01:08:29,375
"The staggering fragrance."

859
01:08:29,875 --> 01:08:32,333
"And the wavering intoxication."

860
01:08:32,833 --> 01:08:38,250
"With you by my side... I can live forever."

861
01:08:38,750 --> 01:08:41,416
"When I fell in love."

862
01:08:41,916 --> 01:08:44,708
"Allah sent me a message."

863
01:08:45,208 --> 01:08:47,875
"It's just you."

864
01:08:48,375 --> 01:08:49,500
"It's just you."

865
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,083
"It's just you."

866
01:08:51,583 --> 01:08:54,166
"Only you."

867
01:08:54,666 --> 01:08:55,916
"It's just you."

868
01:08:56,416 --> 01:08:57,500
"It's just you."

869
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:01,500
"Only you."

870
01:09:19,750 --> 01:09:21,208
Ladies and Gentlemen.

871
01:09:21,708 --> 01:09:23,625
This is State Shooting Championship.

872
01:09:24,125 --> 01:09:28,166
Rapid Fire Pistol, men. Qualifying round.

873
01:09:28,666 --> 01:09:32,291
What's wrong? - Nothing.

874
01:09:32,791 --> 01:09:33,458
Why so nervous?

875
01:09:33,958 --> 01:09:36,083
It's another thing to shoot in a closed room.

876
01:09:36,583 --> 01:09:39,583
But here, amongst this huge crowd..

877
01:09:40,083 --> 01:09:43,750
Relax. Just imagine there's no one here.

878
01:09:44,250 --> 01:09:47,250
No participants, nor me, nor these people.

879
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:48,541
No one.

880
01:09:49,041 --> 01:09:52,000
Just your target and you.

881
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:53,333
Come on.

882
01:09:53,833 --> 01:09:57,333
You can do it. - Shooters, to your firing point.

883
01:10:50,541 --> 01:10:52,416
Gyani Singh from Kanpur..

884
01:10:52,916 --> 01:10:54,583
..who didn't make an impressive beginning.

885
01:10:55,083 --> 01:10:55,416
But he has managed..

886
01:10:55,916 --> 01:10:59,916
..to secure a place for himself in the top 10 position.

887
01:11:00,416 --> 01:11:01,541
Oh, God!

888
01:11:02,041 --> 01:11:05,833
Congratulation. - Thank you.

889
01:11:06,333 --> 01:11:07,666
It's okay.

890
01:11:08,166 --> 01:11:09,916
After watching your initial performance..

891
01:11:10,416 --> 01:11:11,875
..I doubted whether you'll even qualify.

892
01:11:12,375 --> 01:11:13,208
But you did it.

893
01:11:13,708 --> 01:11:16,041
You qualified, Gyani. - He did what?

894
01:11:16,541 --> 01:11:17,750
Brother, he qualified.. - He came ninth!

895
01:11:18,250 --> 01:11:20,333
Qualified?

896
01:11:20,833 --> 01:11:22,541
He didn't come here to qualify. - But..

897
01:11:23,041 --> 01:11:24,208
He didn't come here to qualify.

898
01:11:24,708 --> 01:11:26,000
He came here to win.

899
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:27,875
There's just one...

900
01:11:28,375 --> 01:11:30,291
...and only one winner.

901
01:11:30,791 --> 01:11:34,291
And the rest are losers. Qualifiers.

902
01:11:34,791 --> 01:11:38,791
Everyone wants to win, but those who forsake everything else..

903
01:11:39,291 --> 01:11:42,791
..and lives only for his goal, is the winner.

904
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:58,708
My brother was supposed to represent India in the World Championship.

905
01:11:59,208 --> 01:12:01,500
But, one of his colleagues framed him..

906
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,125
..for selling ammunition.

907
01:12:04,625 --> 01:12:06,916
Major Rathod, we checked your record and service.

908
01:12:07,416 --> 01:12:08,833
On the basis of your 10 years of honest service..

909
01:12:09,333 --> 01:12:12,083
..we feel we should give you another chance.

910
01:12:12,583 --> 01:12:14,958
10 years of honest service, sir.

911
01:12:15,458 --> 01:12:17,125
And you chose not to believe me.

912
01:12:17,625 --> 01:12:20,166
When you've pressed allegations against me..

913
01:12:20,666 --> 01:12:21,041
..so be it.

914
01:12:21,541 --> 01:12:23,875
And I don't want to lose my self-respect, sir.

915
01:12:24,375 --> 01:12:25,250
Here's my resignation.

916
01:12:25,750 --> 01:12:27,833
Brother knew it was a conspiracy.

917
01:12:28,333 --> 01:12:29,875
And so..

918
01:12:30,375 --> 01:12:33,875
..ended brother's dreams of winning a gold medal.

919
01:12:42,625 --> 01:12:45,625
I swear...

920
01:12:46,125 --> 01:12:53,833
I will fulfill the Major's dream.

921
01:12:54,333 --> 01:12:56,500
18x1 are 18. - 18x1 are 18.

922
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,875
18x2 are 36. - 18x2 are 36.

923
01:13:00,375 --> 01:13:03,375
18x3 are 54. - 18x3 are 54.

924
01:13:03,875 --> 01:13:07,000
18x4 are 72. - 18x4 are 72.

925
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:07,791
Well done.

926
01:13:08,291 --> 01:13:13,125
18x5 are..? - 18x5 are..?

927
01:13:13,625 --> 01:13:14,375
18x5 are..

928
01:13:14,875 --> 01:13:19,541
18x5 could be 23

929
01:13:20,041 --> 01:13:22,541
When 18X4 are 72, so how can 18X5 be 23?

930
01:13:23,041 --> 01:13:26,333
I'll check on my calculator, in my mobile.

931
01:13:26,833 --> 01:13:28,541
Yes, 18x5 are 85.

932
01:13:29,041 --> 01:13:30,375
But teacher said its 90.

933
01:13:30,875 --> 01:13:33,083
Teacher could be wrong.

934
01:13:33,583 --> 01:13:34,625
Your calculations are off, Rafiq.

935
01:13:35,125 --> 01:13:35,375
Something wrong with the mobile.

936
01:13:35,875 --> 01:13:36,583
Better set it straight.

937
01:13:37,083 --> 01:13:38,708
18x5 is..

938
01:13:39,208 --> 01:13:41,083
.. what your teacher said.

939
01:13:41,583 --> 01:13:43,833
Hello, sir.

940
01:13:44,333 --> 01:13:48,291
Come, my boy.

941
01:13:48,791 --> 01:13:50,083
Bless you.

942
01:13:50,583 --> 01:13:51,333
Go on, dear.

943
01:13:51,833 --> 01:13:55,333
Mother will help you with the rest of your lesson.

944
01:13:58,208 --> 01:14:00,958
You've become quite famous these days.

945
01:14:01,458 --> 01:14:03,208
It's all because of your grace, sir.

946
01:14:03,708 --> 01:14:09,750
With your blessings, soon I'll be the king of underworld.

947
01:14:10,250 --> 01:14:12,375
Well...

948
01:14:12,875 --> 01:14:16,875
...not all thundering clouds shower.

949
01:14:17,375 --> 01:14:18,875
But this cloud will.

950
01:14:19,375 --> 01:14:24,125
The partridge died yearning for a drop of water.

951
01:14:24,625 --> 01:14:28,791
What's the point if the rain drenched his dead body?

952
01:14:29,291 --> 01:14:31,541
Know..

953
01:14:32,041 --> 01:14:35,541
..where you need to shower.

954
01:14:38,583 --> 01:14:42,083
First, you've to kill Brahmanand.

955
01:15:11,333 --> 01:15:12,291
Bharat lala.

956
01:15:12,791 --> 01:15:15,666
The owner of 90% nightclubs in our country.

957
01:15:16,166 --> 01:15:19,666
But his real business is flesh-trade.

958
01:15:40,875 --> 01:15:43,583
Jugnu. Contract killer.

959
01:15:44,083 --> 01:15:45,625
He's also associated with the drug business.

960
01:15:46,125 --> 01:15:46,583
He easily carries out his jobs..

961
01:15:47,083 --> 01:15:50,583
..under the pretext of his garage.

962
01:16:01,500 --> 01:16:03,500
Vishram Singh. Land Mafia.

963
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,083
He invests on Sultan..

964
01:16:05,583 --> 01:16:06,500
..and also throws his weight around.

965
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,916
This is why the other groups have turned against him.

966
01:16:10,416 --> 01:16:15,041
In the last few years, this man's been funding a group..

967
01:16:15,541 --> 01:16:17,458
..which spread terror in our country.

968
01:16:17,958 --> 01:16:21,458
So it's very important for him to die.

969
01:16:49,833 --> 01:16:51,958
Last night, someone attacked Sultan's men in Mumbai City.

970
01:16:52,458 --> 01:16:57,500
Hari, my mind's really cool now.

971
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,791
I must admit.

972
01:17:01,291 --> 01:17:06,875
You raked up a storm with a single blow.

973
01:17:07,375 --> 01:17:12,166
You've no idea how many storms are raging inside me.

974
01:17:12,666 --> 01:17:14,583
Greetings, sir. - Come, my boy.

975
01:17:15,083 --> 01:17:15,916
Hello.

976
01:17:16,416 --> 01:17:19,916
Come. Come. Well done

977
01:17:22,291 --> 01:17:24,291
Bless you. Sit.

978
01:17:24,791 --> 01:17:26,291
Bless you.

979
01:17:26,791 --> 01:17:30,958
Hari, I must admit your assessment.

980
01:17:31,458 --> 01:17:37,916
You fished out a real gun amongst the pistols.

981
01:17:38,416 --> 01:17:40,541
You're my Guru..

982
01:17:41,041 --> 01:17:44,458
..it doesn't suit you to call this cannon, a gun.

983
01:17:44,958 --> 01:17:46,791
Fine, Hari.

984
01:17:47,291 --> 01:17:48,541
Pali.

985
01:17:49,041 --> 01:17:52,500
From tomorrow put a black dot on your forehead.

986
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,500
Or someone might cast an eye on you.

987
01:17:56,000 --> 01:18:01,708
When sir's my benefactor, no one can harm me.

988
01:18:02,208 --> 01:18:04,083
Just give the orders, sir.

989
01:18:04,583 --> 01:18:07,791
Slowly slowly O mind, everything in own pace happens..

990
01:18:08,291 --> 01:18:10,625
Gardener may water with a hundred pots..

991
01:18:11,125 --> 01:18:14,625
..but it bears fruits only in its season.

992
01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:25,000
What's this?

993
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:28,375
Well...

994
01:18:28,875 --> 01:18:32,458
I don't go to Mumbai.

995
01:18:32,958 --> 01:18:36,458
So my bungalow in Mumbai is now yours.

996
01:18:41,333 --> 01:18:42,666
Go live there Guddi...

997
01:18:43,166 --> 01:18:45,583
...a prosperous life.

998
01:18:46,083 --> 01:18:49,583
Shower lots of love on her.

999
01:19:45,166 --> 01:19:56,333
"Everywhere I look...you're the only one I see."

1000
01:19:56,833 --> 01:20:07,791
"But whenever he looks at me, I hide my face."

1001
01:20:08,291 --> 01:20:13,583
"My dreams are finally come true."

1002
01:20:14,083 --> 01:20:19,875
"His passion and my heart is uniting."

1003
01:20:20,375 --> 01:20:25,458
"There's joy in surrendering yourself.."

1004
01:20:25,958 --> 01:20:31,875
"..how do I say it?"

1005
01:20:32,375 --> 01:20:37,250
"I look like someone else.."

1006
01:20:37,750 --> 01:20:43,666
"My sweetheart...you're my benefactor."

1007
01:20:44,166 --> 01:20:48,833
"I look like someone else.."

1008
01:20:49,333 --> 01:20:55,541
"My sweetheart...you're my benefactor."

1009
01:20:56,041 --> 01:20:59,541
"My sweetheart...you're my benefactor."

1010
01:21:08,083 --> 01:21:11,583
"You're my benefactor."

1011
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:19,500
Look, sir.

1012
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:23,250
Right now when he fired, this was his state of mind.

1013
01:21:23,750 --> 01:21:25,541
Score 10.5.

1014
01:21:26,041 --> 01:21:26,291
Here.

1015
01:21:26,791 --> 01:21:31,166
And when his score was 10.7, this was his state of mind.

1016
01:21:31,666 --> 01:21:35,875
And when his score was 10.2, then this was his state of mind.

1017
01:21:36,375 --> 01:21:38,500
You mean, basically..

1018
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:40,625
..this is the best state of mind..

1019
01:21:41,125 --> 01:21:43,166
..he should be, when he's shooting, right.

1020
01:21:43,666 --> 01:21:43,833
Yes.

1021
01:21:44,333 --> 01:21:44,541
Right. - Yes.

1022
01:21:45,041 --> 01:21:45,541
Shot's best, then.

1023
01:21:46,041 --> 01:21:47,041
Yes.

1024
01:21:47,541 --> 01:21:50,666
Sounds good. - Okay.

1025
01:21:51,166 --> 01:21:53,125
Gyani, listen to me carefully.

1026
01:21:53,625 --> 01:21:58,125
Listen to your heartbeats.

1027
01:21:58,625 --> 01:22:03,875
Recognize the gap between the two heartbeats.

1028
01:22:04,375 --> 01:22:08,500
That is the right time to get your target.

1029
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:09,625
Okay?

1030
01:22:10,125 --> 01:22:13,625
Try!

1031
01:22:21,708 --> 01:22:22,541
Awesome.

1032
01:22:23,041 --> 01:22:26,541
Very nice.

1033
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:55,583
Gyani Singh from Uttar Pradesh..

1034
01:23:56,083 --> 01:23:59,583
..has won the National Championship.

1035
01:24:06,833 --> 01:24:10,333
"Lend me...a kiss.."

1036
01:24:19,708 --> 01:24:23,208
Sweetheart...

1037
01:24:25,375 --> 01:24:27,458
Why did you stop? I was counting.

1038
01:24:27,958 --> 01:24:28,500
Come on, do it again.

1039
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,541
Paridhi, what are we doing?

1040
01:24:32,041 --> 01:24:34,375
We never do what we should.

1041
01:24:34,875 --> 01:24:36,583
Shut up, now concentrate.

1042
01:24:37,083 --> 01:24:37,583
Let's do one thing.

1043
01:24:38,083 --> 01:24:39,916
Give me a kiss, and I'll focus on my task.

1044
01:24:40,416 --> 01:24:41,875
Honestly.

1045
01:24:42,375 --> 01:24:42,833
Kiss?

1046
01:24:43,333 --> 01:24:46,833
Yes.

1047
01:24:54,041 --> 01:24:56,125
First hit a bulls-eye.

1048
01:24:56,625 --> 01:24:59,000
What's that got to do with my kiss?

1049
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:05,041
Same thing that your kiss has to do with my physiotherapy.

1050
01:25:05,541 --> 01:25:08,000
Oh no...this girl's too much.

1051
01:25:08,500 --> 01:25:12,000
She doesn't understand. - Come on.

1052
01:25:17,041 --> 01:25:19,541
Who or what he was, how does it make a difference?

1053
01:25:20,041 --> 01:25:22,041
Why are you giving such an importance?

1054
01:25:22,541 --> 01:25:24,625
All that matters is that he's got superb quality..

1055
01:25:25,125 --> 01:25:27,916
..of a true international champion.

1056
01:25:28,416 --> 01:25:31,250
And he's proved that, by winning the national Championship.

1057
01:25:31,750 --> 01:25:33,958
Sir, I can give you in writing.

1058
01:25:34,458 --> 01:25:35,791
In future, this boy will rewrite history..

1059
01:25:36,291 --> 01:25:41,125
..in every international shooting Championship, with gold.

1060
01:25:41,625 --> 01:25:43,625
Major Rathod, you don't understand.

1061
01:25:44,125 --> 01:25:45,625
We can't change policies.

1062
01:25:46,125 --> 01:25:47,791
What kind of policy is this, sir..

1063
01:25:48,291 --> 01:25:50,541
..where a man isn't allowed to forget his past..

1064
01:25:51,041 --> 01:25:52,875
..and pursue a new life?

1065
01:25:53,375 --> 01:25:55,250
Major..

1066
01:25:55,750 --> 01:25:56,416
..you're getting emotional now.

1067
01:25:56,916 --> 01:25:59,291
You've to understand, we can be questioned too.

1068
01:25:59,791 --> 01:26:01,958
I'll answer those questions, sir.

1069
01:26:02,458 --> 01:26:05,958
That's not the point, Major.

1070
01:26:07,583 --> 01:26:10,375
Sir.

1071
01:26:10,875 --> 01:26:14,250
Sir, I take full responsibility.

1072
01:26:14,750 --> 01:26:15,125
But..

1073
01:26:15,625 --> 01:26:17,958
Hold on, Mr. Rathod. Calm down.

1074
01:26:18,458 --> 01:26:19,125
Take these medals back.

1075
01:26:19,625 --> 01:26:21,500
Keep it safe.

1076
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,291
Sorry to interfere, but..

1077
01:26:24,791 --> 01:26:27,791
Just like you can't fly kites with nylon threads.

1078
01:26:28,291 --> 01:26:32,125
Similarly we can't allow criminals to take part in a shooting championship.

1079
01:26:32,625 --> 01:26:34,083
That's right. - Understand?

1080
01:26:34,583 --> 01:26:37,416
That's all.

1081
01:26:37,916 --> 01:26:39,916
In a clearer language, full stop.

1082
01:26:40,416 --> 01:26:42,333
Jai Hind. - Fine.

1083
01:26:42,833 --> 01:26:45,333
Fine.

1084
01:26:45,833 --> 01:26:48,666
Today this boy wants to represent India.

1085
01:26:49,166 --> 01:26:51,583
Tomorrow if he turns into a criminal..

1086
01:26:52,083 --> 01:26:55,583
..then you'll be responsible for it.

1087
01:27:14,625 --> 01:27:15,375
Patil sir.

1088
01:27:15,875 --> 01:27:17,125
Please, Patil sir.

1089
01:27:17,625 --> 01:27:19,250
Don't disappoint me.

1090
01:27:19,750 --> 01:27:22,375
That boy's only few steps away from his goal.

1091
01:27:22,875 --> 01:27:26,041
If he has to go back, he won't be able to live.

1092
01:27:26,541 --> 01:27:28,333
Look, this isn't possible.

1093
01:27:28,833 --> 01:27:30,666
You know that boy's background.

1094
01:27:31,166 --> 01:27:32,375
And you're still asking me for permission.

1095
01:27:32,875 --> 01:27:33,958
Patil sir, it's not like that anymore.

1096
01:27:34,458 --> 01:27:35,125
He's a talented boy.

1097
01:27:35,625 --> 01:27:36,541
He can win the gold medal for India.

1098
01:27:37,041 --> 01:27:38,083
Look, don't argue.

1099
01:27:38,583 --> 01:27:39,791
You're just wasting my time.

1100
01:27:40,291 --> 01:27:43,791
Come on. Let's go. - Please, Patil sir.

1101
01:27:54,375 --> 01:27:57,541
You're a dog.

1102
01:27:58,041 --> 01:27:58,333
What?

1103
01:27:58,833 --> 01:28:01,541
You'll be a great shooter. - No.

1104
01:28:02,041 --> 01:28:04,125
You said something else? - What?

1105
01:28:04,625 --> 01:28:05,041
Did you call me a dog?

1106
01:28:05,541 --> 01:28:06,708
Are you crazy?

1107
01:28:07,208 --> 01:28:10,708
Yeah. Right?

1108
01:28:16,833 --> 01:28:20,333
Brother.

1109
01:28:25,083 --> 01:28:28,583
Is everything okay, brother?

1110
01:28:31,083 --> 01:28:31,916
I lost.

1111
01:28:32,416 --> 01:28:33,833
Why? What happened?

1112
01:28:34,333 --> 01:28:37,833
Paridhi..

1113
01:28:38,833 --> 01:28:40,250
..Gyani's application was rejected.

1114
01:28:40,750 --> 01:28:43,708
What?

1115
01:28:44,208 --> 01:28:47,000
I am sorry, son.

1116
01:28:47,500 --> 01:28:49,291
Forgive me.

1117
01:28:49,791 --> 01:28:53,875
I couldn't do anything for you.

1118
01:28:54,375 --> 01:28:55,083
I am sorry.

1119
01:28:55,583 --> 01:28:59,083
I am sorry.

1120
01:29:04,500 --> 01:29:08,000
But...brother...listen to me.

1121
01:30:03,416 --> 01:30:05,666
Gyani.

1122
01:30:06,166 --> 01:30:08,666
Gyani, it's quite late. Get some sleep.

1123
01:30:09,166 --> 01:30:14,250
Gyani, I am speaking to you. Get some sleep.

1124
01:30:14,750 --> 01:30:16,333
How?

1125
01:30:16,833 --> 01:30:18,500
How?

1126
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:24,375
You've already snatched our sleep.

1127
01:30:24,875 --> 01:30:26,916
Tell me one thing..

1128
01:30:27,416 --> 01:30:28,541
Why did you give us hopes..

1129
01:30:29,041 --> 01:30:31,875
..which could never be fulfilled? - What..

1130
01:30:32,375 --> 01:30:34,625
You know everything about us.

1131
01:30:35,125 --> 01:30:38,625
And you came to us.. - Gyani.

1132
01:30:44,291 --> 01:30:46,625
I am player.

1133
01:30:47,125 --> 01:30:49,208
..and I know how to play my game.

1134
01:30:49,708 --> 01:30:52,541
I don't care about any permission.

1135
01:30:53,041 --> 01:30:57,625
I just want to win the gold medal.

1136
01:30:58,125 --> 01:31:00,083
And yes...

1137
01:31:00,583 --> 01:31:04,666
...until now, this was just your dream.

1138
01:31:05,166 --> 01:31:06,666
But now...

1139
01:31:07,166 --> 01:31:10,291
...it's mine.

1140
01:31:10,791 --> 01:31:14,291
And I will achieve it at any cost.

1141
01:31:21,291 --> 01:31:21,958
Brother!

1142
01:31:22,458 --> 01:31:22,875
Brother!

1143
01:31:23,375 --> 01:31:25,583
Major.. - Just stay away from us!

1144
01:31:26,083 --> 01:31:27,250
Who do you think you are?

1145
01:31:27,750 --> 01:31:31,333
I never thought you would be so mean and selfish.

1146
01:31:31,833 --> 01:31:33,333
My brother did everything he could for you.

1147
01:31:33,833 --> 01:31:35,500
And this is how you repaid him.

1148
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:36,041
Brother..

1149
01:31:36,541 --> 01:31:38,166
Paridhi, listen to me. - Go away.

1150
01:31:38,666 --> 01:31:39,875
We don't need you.

1151
01:31:40,375 --> 01:31:41,000
Just go.

1152
01:31:41,500 --> 01:31:42,708
Just get out of here.

1153
01:31:43,208 --> 01:31:48,000
Get out. Go!

1154
01:31:48,500 --> 01:31:49,916
Brother.

1155
01:31:50,416 --> 01:31:53,916
Ramu uncle.

1156
01:32:00,708 --> 01:32:02,083
Gyani?

1157
01:32:02,583 --> 01:32:06,083
At this hour?

1158
01:32:07,208 --> 01:32:10,625
Hello Gyani..

1159
01:32:11,125 --> 01:32:12,625
Gyani. - Yes, Pali.

1160
01:32:13,125 --> 01:32:13,750
What happened?

1161
01:32:14,250 --> 01:32:15,125
Why are you calling at this hour?

1162
01:32:15,625 --> 01:32:18,875
I was just missing you.

1163
01:32:19,375 --> 01:32:21,666
So I thought I'd call you.

1164
01:32:22,166 --> 01:32:25,083
But it's too late, isn't it?

1165
01:32:25,583 --> 01:32:26,875
Fine, get some sleep. We'll talk later.

1166
01:32:27,375 --> 01:32:29,041
Hold on.

1167
01:32:29,541 --> 01:32:30,750
What's wrong? Tell me.

1168
01:32:31,250 --> 01:32:32,750
Nothing. - Nothing?

1169
01:32:33,250 --> 01:32:36,125
Then why do you sound so different?

1170
01:32:36,625 --> 01:32:38,541
I am not.

1171
01:32:39,041 --> 01:32:41,166
You're crying?

1172
01:32:41,666 --> 01:32:42,375
Are you crazy?

1173
01:32:42,875 --> 01:32:43,375
Why will I cry?

1174
01:32:43,875 --> 01:32:46,416
Don't try to lie to me. Me.

1175
01:32:46,916 --> 01:32:48,416
I know you better than you.

1176
01:32:48,916 --> 01:32:49,583
Understand.

1177
01:32:50,083 --> 01:32:52,291
Tell me...who made you cry.

1178
01:32:52,791 --> 01:32:54,041
Just tell me his name.

1179
01:32:54,541 --> 01:32:55,875
I will kill him.

1180
01:32:56,375 --> 01:33:00,791
It's not what you think. - If not, then you're coming to me tomorrow.

1181
01:33:01,291 --> 01:33:03,333
Or else, I am coming there. - No, no, no.

1182
01:33:03,833 --> 01:33:04,291
You won't come.

1183
01:33:04,791 --> 01:33:06,416
I'm coming, okay.

1184
01:33:06,916 --> 01:33:08,250
We'll talk tomorrow.

1185
01:33:08,750 --> 01:33:11,291
Hello.

1186
01:33:11,791 --> 01:33:15,291
Is everything okay?

1187
01:33:30,625 --> 01:33:33,083
Earlier you couldn't stop chattering.

1188
01:33:33,583 --> 01:33:36,083
And look at you now. As if you've lost your voice.

1189
01:33:36,583 --> 01:33:39,083
Tell me what's wrong?

1190
01:33:39,583 --> 01:33:43,083
Due to my criminal background, my application was rejected.

1191
01:33:47,541 --> 01:33:51,000
I can never compete again.

1192
01:33:51,500 --> 01:33:53,291
That's all.

1193
01:33:53,791 --> 01:33:56,291
Is that all?

1194
01:33:56,791 --> 01:33:59,833
Rascal...that's good news.

1195
01:34:00,333 --> 01:34:02,291
You scared me.

1196
01:34:02,791 --> 01:34:07,291
This is what we wanted since we were kids.

1197
01:34:07,791 --> 01:34:11,708
And look where fate brought us.

1198
01:34:12,208 --> 01:34:16,583
Back together.

1199
01:34:17,083 --> 01:34:19,750
I've yearned a lot.

1200
01:34:20,250 --> 01:34:23,750
No more.

1201
01:34:24,250 --> 01:34:27,291
I won't let you go away.

1202
01:34:27,791 --> 01:34:33,333
We'll work together... and have fun.

1203
01:34:33,833 --> 01:34:37,333
Look happy.

1204
01:34:55,666 --> 01:34:57,791
'Today this boy wants to represent India.'

1205
01:34:58,291 --> 01:34:59,583
'Tomorrow if he turns into a criminal..'

1206
01:35:00,083 --> 01:35:03,583
'..then you'll be responsible for it.'

1207
01:35:18,791 --> 01:35:20,166
Don't drink too much, Pali..

1208
01:35:20,666 --> 01:35:21,583
..or you might get out-of-control.

1209
01:35:22,083 --> 01:35:25,166
Today I am going to drink up a storm.

1210
01:35:25,666 --> 01:35:26,750
Drink up a storm!

1211
01:35:27,250 --> 01:35:30,750
My friend's back...to look after me.

1212
01:35:49,916 --> 01:35:51,541
Paridhi. - Where are you?

1213
01:35:52,041 --> 01:35:53,541
I've been trying to reach you for 10 days.

1214
01:35:54,041 --> 01:35:55,166
But it's always unreachable.

1215
01:35:55,666 --> 01:35:56,666
Isn't this what you wanted?

1216
01:35:57,166 --> 01:36:00,666
I said something in a fit of rage, and you left.

1217
01:36:01,166 --> 01:36:03,625
Is this your love?

1218
01:36:04,125 --> 01:36:06,333
I am really, really sorry.

1219
01:36:06,833 --> 01:36:10,208
It's my fault.. - No, Paridhi.

1220
01:36:10,708 --> 01:36:13,333
I was wrong with you.

1221
01:36:13,833 --> 01:36:18,000
Please forgive me.

1222
01:36:18,500 --> 01:36:23,000
Guddi. Come here.

1223
01:36:23,500 --> 01:36:25,166
Guddi.. - What's going on?

1224
01:36:25,666 --> 01:36:27,291
Pali..

1225
01:36:27,791 --> 01:36:29,791
..why are you drinking so much?

1226
01:36:30,291 --> 01:36:34,833
Because I am very happy today.

1227
01:36:35,333 --> 01:36:40,541
You know...there was a time..

1228
01:36:41,041 --> 01:36:47,125
..when we couldn't afford a square meal.

1229
01:36:47,625 --> 01:36:49,125
And now...

1230
01:36:49,625 --> 01:36:50,708
Look..

1231
01:36:51,208 --> 01:36:52,541
Look..

1232
01:36:53,041 --> 01:36:54,250
I've everything.

1233
01:36:54,750 --> 01:36:55,791
Everything.

1234
01:36:56,291 --> 01:36:58,291
Money. Power.

1235
01:36:58,791 --> 01:37:00,500
Today...

1236
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,791
...I can throw a feast for the entire village.

1237
01:37:04,291 --> 01:37:08,541
Right, Lokesh? - Right.

1238
01:37:09,041 --> 01:37:15,375
Well, forget that...and tell me how are you?

1239
01:37:15,875 --> 01:37:18,833
And how's the Major?

1240
01:37:19,333 --> 01:37:22,708
Gyani.

1241
01:37:23,208 --> 01:37:24,833
Hello, Gyani. Where are you?

1242
01:37:25,333 --> 01:37:28,791
Don't you want to practice shooting?

1243
01:37:29,291 --> 01:37:29,791
What?

1244
01:37:30,291 --> 01:37:33,541
You've been granted permission.

1245
01:37:34,041 --> 01:37:37,250
Hang up the phone and come back quickly.

1246
01:37:37,750 --> 01:37:38,916
Yes, Major. I'm coming back.

1247
01:37:39,416 --> 01:37:41,083
Good.

1248
01:37:41,583 --> 01:37:44,500
Really, brother, did he get permission?

1249
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:46,333
Have I ever lied to you?

1250
01:37:46,833 --> 01:37:48,875
Oh, God. Brother, I am so happy.

1251
01:37:49,375 --> 01:37:50,041
I'm so happy.

1252
01:37:50,541 --> 01:37:55,416
On this joyous occasion, have a drink with me.

1253
01:37:55,916 --> 01:37:57,916
Come on.

1254
01:37:58,416 --> 01:38:01,500
Pali.

1255
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:05,083
Gyani. What is it?

1256
01:38:05,583 --> 01:38:06,916
You look really happy.

1257
01:38:07,416 --> 01:38:08,541
Yes, Pali.

1258
01:38:09,041 --> 01:38:13,041
Your brother's been granted permission.

1259
01:38:13,541 --> 01:38:18,125
Now just watch. I'll beat everyone at the championship.

1260
01:38:18,625 --> 01:38:22,916
This time I'll win a gold medal for India.

1261
01:38:23,416 --> 01:38:24,541
Well, Pali, I'll leave.

1262
01:38:25,041 --> 01:38:25,916
I've to prepare.

1263
01:38:26,416 --> 01:38:27,583
You won't go anywhere.

1264
01:38:28,083 --> 01:38:30,958
Pali, I have to go.

1265
01:38:31,458 --> 01:38:36,208
I said you're not going, and that's it.

1266
01:38:36,708 --> 01:38:38,958
Who do you think you are?

1267
01:38:39,458 --> 01:38:42,083
You can come here whenever you like.

1268
01:38:42,583 --> 01:38:45,666
And leave when you want.

1269
01:38:46,166 --> 01:38:48,500
I have feelings too.

1270
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:52,875
I feel hurt too, Gyani.

1271
01:38:53,375 --> 01:39:00,791
And you...want to leave your friend, for those strangers.

1272
01:39:01,291 --> 01:39:02,541
That's not it, Pali.

1273
01:39:03,041 --> 01:39:03,875
Pali.. - Leave me, Guddi.

1274
01:39:04,375 --> 01:39:07,541
Pali...

1275
01:39:08,041 --> 01:39:09,333
Pali, try to understand.

1276
01:39:09,833 --> 01:39:11,791
I have to go back.

1277
01:39:12,291 --> 01:39:13,750
It's my dream.

1278
01:39:14,250 --> 01:39:16,208
You don't have to see any dream.

1279
01:39:16,708 --> 01:39:19,166
You don't need it.

1280
01:39:19,666 --> 01:39:22,541
You don't. - I have to go.

1281
01:39:23,041 --> 01:39:24,708
Rascal..

1282
01:39:25,208 --> 01:39:26,708
Pali... - Let go.

1283
01:39:27,208 --> 01:39:28,125
Pali... - Leave me.

1284
01:39:28,625 --> 01:39:30,375
Pali... - Leave me.

1285
01:39:30,875 --> 01:39:34,375
Pali... - Leave me.

1286
01:40:00,666 --> 01:40:01,833
Come on, Paridhi. Come on.

1287
01:40:02,333 --> 01:40:04,333
I need more, more, more.

1288
01:40:04,833 --> 01:40:06,458
I need at least 5 more. Quick.

1289
01:40:06,958 --> 01:40:07,708
Now why are you so slow?

1290
01:40:08,208 --> 01:40:09,583
Brother, let him come first.

1291
01:40:10,083 --> 01:40:12,500
He's on his way, we just spoke.

1292
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:13,625
There's a lot to do.

1293
01:40:14,125 --> 01:40:15,083
He hasn't practiced.

1294
01:40:15,583 --> 01:40:21,125
But mark my words, that boy's gold medalist material.

1295
01:40:21,625 --> 01:40:23,958
Gyani. We were just talking about you.

1296
01:40:24,458 --> 01:40:25,625
You have a long life.

1297
01:40:26,125 --> 01:40:27,666
You'll live for at least 100 years.

1298
01:40:28,166 --> 01:40:28,750
What's wrong?

1299
01:40:29,250 --> 01:40:31,416
Why are you so sad?

1300
01:40:31,916 --> 01:40:35,041
Forgive me, Major. - For what?

1301
01:40:35,541 --> 01:40:37,541
I made a big mistake.

1302
01:40:38,041 --> 01:40:39,750
Gyani.

1303
01:40:40,250 --> 01:40:42,958
What's this, Gyani?

1304
01:40:43,458 --> 01:40:45,375
It's just... - What?

1305
01:40:45,875 --> 01:40:49,000
It's just a minor injury, that's all.

1306
01:40:49,500 --> 01:40:53,750
Minor wound...or bullet wound.

1307
01:40:54,250 --> 01:40:55,875
Gyani, what were you thinking?

1308
01:40:56,375 --> 01:40:58,083
Gyani..

1309
01:40:58,583 --> 01:41:00,416
God. There's no point.

1310
01:41:00,916 --> 01:41:02,000
You will never understand.

1311
01:41:02,500 --> 01:41:06,375
I did everything.

1312
01:41:06,875 --> 01:41:10,375
How will you shoot now?

1313
01:41:12,375 --> 01:41:15,875
Gyani.

1314
01:41:40,416 --> 01:41:43,708
Pali's your true friend, isn't it?

1315
01:41:44,208 --> 01:41:46,125
I don't just believe it..

1316
01:41:46,625 --> 01:41:47,625
..I know he's my true friend.

1317
01:41:48,125 --> 01:41:53,125
What kind of a friend is he, who tried to kill you?

1318
01:41:53,625 --> 01:41:57,750
If he wanted to kill me, he would've shot here.

1319
01:41:58,250 --> 01:41:58,541
Not here.

1320
01:41:59,041 --> 01:42:01,916
So what's this? - This.

1321
01:42:02,416 --> 01:42:04,625
This was his pain...

1322
01:42:05,125 --> 01:42:06,375
...of separation.

1323
01:42:06,875 --> 01:42:11,000
Then keep you can keep your friend and his pain.

1324
01:42:11,500 --> 01:42:11,791
Paridhi.

1325
01:42:12,291 --> 01:42:13,750
What's wrong, Paridhi?

1326
01:42:14,250 --> 01:42:17,750
Paridhi?

1327
01:42:32,541 --> 01:42:34,750
What are you doing, Pali?

1328
01:42:35,250 --> 01:42:37,500
Why are you ruining your life?

1329
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:42,541
What else can I do?

1330
01:42:43,041 --> 01:42:46,416
I can't think of anything.

1331
01:42:46,916 --> 01:42:50,416
Go away.

1332
01:42:52,416 --> 01:42:55,458
Your brother's been granted permission.

1333
01:42:55,958 --> 01:42:56,833
You won't go anywhere.

1334
01:42:57,333 --> 01:42:58,750
Pali, I have to go.

1335
01:42:59,250 --> 01:43:02,208
I said you're not going, and that's it. - It's my dream.

1336
01:43:02,708 --> 01:43:06,541
You will desert your friend for those strangers.

1337
01:43:07,041 --> 01:43:10,541
Rascal..

1338
01:43:16,125 --> 01:43:18,416
Gyani!

1339
01:43:18,916 --> 01:43:21,625
Pali.

1340
01:43:22,125 --> 01:43:25,666
He's gone.

1341
01:43:26,166 --> 01:43:26,750
He hasn't gone anywhere.

1342
01:43:27,250 --> 01:43:30,500
He will come back.

1343
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:34,083
He won't come back, Guddi.

1344
01:43:34,583 --> 01:43:36,333
I shot him.

1345
01:43:36,833 --> 01:43:38,250
I...shot him.

1346
01:43:38,750 --> 01:43:41,041
I shot my brother.

1347
01:43:41,541 --> 01:43:42,916
Pali, it was a mistake.

1348
01:43:43,416 --> 01:43:45,875
Pali, you didn't do it intentionally.

1349
01:43:46,375 --> 01:43:47,291
Pali, calm down.

1350
01:43:47,791 --> 01:43:51,958
But I am responsible, Guddi.

1351
01:43:52,458 --> 01:43:55,541
Pali, calm down.

1352
01:43:56,041 --> 01:43:57,791
I committed a big sin.

1353
01:43:58,291 --> 01:44:02,666
I can never forgive myself.

1354
01:44:03,166 --> 01:44:06,750
Pali..

1355
01:44:07,250 --> 01:44:11,166
Brother...Gyani will get tough competition..

1356
01:44:11,666 --> 01:44:14,291
..from Australia and Germany.

1357
01:44:14,791 --> 01:44:15,458
You're absolutely right.

1358
01:44:15,958 --> 01:44:18,375
These two have been securing no.1 and no.2 positions..

1359
01:44:18,875 --> 01:44:20,916
..for past many events.

1360
01:44:21,416 --> 01:44:23,750
But you cannot underestimate any of the other teams.

1361
01:44:24,250 --> 01:44:26,750
Gyani will have to work hard.

1362
01:44:27,250 --> 01:44:29,541
Gyani.

1363
01:44:30,041 --> 01:44:30,958
Gyani.

1364
01:44:31,458 --> 01:44:34,958
What are you thinking?

1365
01:44:36,916 --> 01:44:40,333
I am missing Pali.

1366
01:44:40,833 --> 01:44:43,000
My mind's clotted with strange thoughts.

1367
01:44:43,500 --> 01:44:45,375
Call him.

1368
01:44:45,875 --> 01:44:49,333
I tried calling him, but he didn't answer.

1369
01:44:49,833 --> 01:44:52,333
I am scared.

1370
01:44:52,833 --> 01:44:54,541
It's very important for me to meet him.

1371
01:44:55,041 --> 01:44:58,041
Please, sir, just once.. - Sorry.

1372
01:44:58,541 --> 01:45:02,041
This isn't possible.

1373
01:45:06,708 --> 01:45:08,208
Pali.

1374
01:45:08,708 --> 01:45:10,083
Hello, Pali.

1375
01:45:10,583 --> 01:45:12,166
Where are you? I tried calling you.

1376
01:45:12,666 --> 01:45:15,458
I am at our old hangout, come quickly.

1377
01:45:15,958 --> 01:45:16,708
Our hangout.

1378
01:45:17,208 --> 01:45:20,708
I'm coming.

1379
01:45:25,291 --> 01:45:27,458
Major...

1380
01:45:27,958 --> 01:45:30,583
...please let me go.

1381
01:45:31,083 --> 01:45:34,583
Please.

1382
01:45:39,416 --> 01:45:44,000
As a coach, I cannot allow you to go.

1383
01:45:44,500 --> 01:45:48,083
But as a human being..

1384
01:45:48,583 --> 01:45:50,083
..I won't stop you.

1385
01:45:50,583 --> 01:45:54,083
Thank you, sir.

1386
01:46:14,625 --> 01:46:18,125
Pali, my brother.

1387
01:46:25,416 --> 01:46:28,333
Rascal, you trouble me so much.

1388
01:46:28,833 --> 01:46:30,750
And...why weren't you answering my calls?

1389
01:46:31,250 --> 01:46:32,125
Tell me.

1390
01:46:32,625 --> 01:46:33,833
Rascal...

1391
01:46:34,333 --> 01:46:38,958
...how could I answer your call?

1392
01:46:39,458 --> 01:46:41,833
Forgive me.

1393
01:46:42,333 --> 01:46:43,875
I made a big mistake.

1394
01:46:44,375 --> 01:46:47,083
So...you're still stuck on that.

1395
01:46:47,583 --> 01:46:49,083
You shot me here.

1396
01:46:49,583 --> 01:46:51,166
Well, you can shoot me here too.

1397
01:46:51,666 --> 01:46:54,208
I can even give my life for you.

1398
01:46:54,708 --> 01:47:00,125
Buddy, take care of it for me.

1399
01:47:00,625 --> 01:47:04,125
Pali, there's still time.

1400
01:47:04,625 --> 01:47:05,916
Leave everything.

1401
01:47:06,416 --> 01:47:09,500
You'll gain nothing through shedding blood.

1402
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,250
You've really turned wise.

1403
01:47:12,750 --> 01:47:15,291
You don't understand.

1404
01:47:15,791 --> 01:47:20,875
It's still not too late.

1405
01:47:21,375 --> 01:47:23,500
But you know...

1406
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:28,166
...I never look back.

1407
01:47:28,666 --> 01:47:33,500
Forget it, keep this.

1408
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:38,958
When you play for India, keep this close to you.

1409
01:47:39,458 --> 01:47:42,958
I'll feel that I'm standing next to you.

1410
01:47:49,333 --> 01:47:51,791
Now this is your world, your goal.

1411
01:47:52,291 --> 01:47:55,500
You made this possible, Major.

1412
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,166
Your efforts did.

1413
01:47:58,666 --> 01:48:02,416
A journey which started from a small with a pistol..

1414
01:48:02,916 --> 01:48:07,875
..could've never made it this far.

1415
01:48:08,375 --> 01:48:11,666
Go grab the opportunity.

1416
01:48:12,166 --> 01:48:15,666
"When you've just one life."

1417
01:48:16,166 --> 01:48:24,041
"Don't think, it's either cut or cure."

1418
01:48:24,541 --> 01:48:27,791
"An honorable life...

1419
01:48:28,291 --> 01:48:32,083
"No matter how strong your body is.."

1420
01:48:32,583 --> 01:48:36,000
"..without courage, you'll always be a prey."

1421
01:48:36,500 --> 01:48:39,916
"When the fire's burning."

1422
01:48:40,416 --> 01:48:44,666
"When the balance is just right."

1423
01:48:45,166 --> 01:48:48,458
"Whether its attack or defense, whether its check or mate."

1424
01:48:48,958 --> 01:48:52,458
"Aim at your target with all your rage."

1425
01:48:57,416 --> 01:49:00,458
"Shoot..."

1426
01:49:00,958 --> 01:49:04,666
"Don't miss your target."

1427
01:49:05,166 --> 01:49:07,791
"Shoot. Just shoot."

1428
01:49:08,291 --> 01:49:12,875
"Don't let your desires die."

1429
01:49:13,375 --> 01:49:16,958
"Create an uproar with your unmatched skill."

1430
01:49:17,458 --> 01:49:21,291
"Listen to your heart, and no one else."

1431
01:49:21,791 --> 01:49:24,125
"Shoot..."

1432
01:49:24,625 --> 01:49:29,125
"Don't miss your target."

1433
01:49:29,625 --> 01:49:32,208
"Shoot. Just shoot."

1434
01:49:32,708 --> 01:49:36,208
"Don't let your desire die."

1435
01:49:45,500 --> 01:49:48,750
Pali.

1436
01:49:49,250 --> 01:49:53,333
Why are you so sad?

1437
01:49:53,833 --> 01:49:56,708
Gyani hasn't left you.

1438
01:49:57,208 --> 01:49:59,125
He's just not close to you.

1439
01:49:59,625 --> 01:50:02,000
Pali..

1440
01:50:02,500 --> 01:50:06,000
But Suraj's coming.

1441
01:50:10,416 --> 01:50:13,416
Suraj? - Yes. Suraj.

1442
01:50:13,916 --> 01:50:17,416
Pali, do I have to explain you everything?

1443
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:39,708
Guddi.

1444
01:50:40,208 --> 01:50:43,708
Guddi. What happened?

1445
01:50:49,666 --> 01:50:50,791
Guddi, you'll be fine.

1446
01:50:51,291 --> 01:50:52,708
You'll be fine.

1447
01:50:53,208 --> 01:50:56,708
Guddi.

1448
01:51:13,333 --> 01:51:15,083
Guddi, I will come back.

1449
01:51:15,583 --> 01:51:17,125
I will come back.

1450
01:51:17,625 --> 01:51:20,375
Guddi, are you listening?

1451
01:51:20,875 --> 01:51:24,375
I will come back.

1452
01:52:58,375 --> 01:52:59,041
Look, Pali.

1453
01:52:59,541 --> 01:53:03,333
Look, Pali. - Rascal..

1454
01:53:03,833 --> 01:53:07,333
Pali...don't hit me.

1455
01:53:31,875 --> 01:53:35,375
Guddi, get up.

1456
01:54:26,208 --> 01:54:27,666
I was deeply hurt...

1457
01:54:28,166 --> 01:54:31,041
...when I heard about Guddi.

1458
01:54:31,541 --> 01:54:34,375
People come and go.

1459
01:54:34,875 --> 01:54:36,875
But life doesn't stop.

1460
01:54:37,375 --> 01:54:39,125
You've to do many tasks.

1461
01:54:39,625 --> 01:54:43,125
Life means moving on.

1462
01:55:18,875 --> 01:55:22,375
Hari.

1463
01:55:24,875 --> 01:55:25,708
Greetings, Guru.

1464
01:55:26,208 --> 01:55:27,958
Bless you, Hari.

1465
01:55:28,458 --> 01:55:28,791
What's wrong, Hari?

1466
01:55:29,291 --> 01:55:31,333
Why did you call me?

1467
01:55:31,833 --> 01:55:35,250
I am in a dilemma. - Really?

1468
01:55:35,750 --> 01:55:39,333
Since you're my Guru, I thought I should discuss it with you.

1469
01:55:39,833 --> 01:55:41,333
Yes, of course.

1470
01:55:41,833 --> 01:55:45,500
Tell me the problem, and I'll solve it.

1471
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:47,833
He who remembers God knows no sensual pleasures

1472
01:55:48,333 --> 01:55:50,250
He who doesn't remember God takes delight in sensual pleasures

1473
01:55:50,750 --> 01:55:53,125
God and sensual pleasures won't unite

1474
01:55:53,625 --> 01:55:55,583
as there can be no union of the Sun and the night.

1475
01:55:56,083 --> 01:55:59,583
Don't confuse me.

1476
01:56:00,083 --> 01:56:03,541
What's the matter?

1477
01:56:04,041 --> 01:56:08,125
If a kin deceives you...

1478
01:56:08,625 --> 01:56:09,500
...then what should we do?

1479
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:11,541
Is that all?

1480
01:56:12,041 --> 01:56:15,958
If it's someone special, then he should be given a chance.

1481
01:56:16,458 --> 01:56:19,958
Otherwise..

1482
01:56:25,666 --> 01:56:29,166
Hari...

1483
01:56:34,750 --> 01:56:36,625
You were special...

1484
01:56:37,125 --> 01:56:40,083
...but not too special.

1485
01:56:40,583 --> 01:56:44,083
Mahadev.

1486
01:56:52,541 --> 01:56:56,625
When a pupil exceeds his mentor..

1487
01:56:57,125 --> 01:57:01,625
..and makes him proud..

1488
01:57:02,125 --> 01:57:03,666
..the mentor feels proud.

1489
01:57:04,166 --> 01:57:06,791
But when the same pupil treads on the wrong path..

1490
01:57:07,291 --> 01:57:09,875
..the mentor feels humiliated.

1491
01:57:10,375 --> 01:57:15,041
I can't kill you, because you're like a son to me.

1492
01:57:15,541 --> 01:57:18,833
But I can distance you from me.

1493
01:57:19,333 --> 01:57:21,791
Judge sir, how can you say that?

1494
01:57:22,291 --> 01:57:24,916
What did I do wrong?

1495
01:57:25,416 --> 01:57:28,125
You've to think what right..

1496
01:57:28,625 --> 01:57:31,666
..or wrong you did.

1497
01:57:32,166 --> 01:57:35,666
Mahadev!

1498
01:57:58,791 --> 01:58:00,166
Ladies and Gentleme.

1499
01:58:00,666 --> 01:58:02,500
This is World Shooting Championship..

1500
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:06,083
..Rapid Fire Pistol, finals series 1.

1501
01:58:06,583 --> 01:58:10,083
Shooters, to your firing point.

1502
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:48,000
What is all this?

1503
02:00:48,500 --> 02:00:49,333
Tell me.

1504
02:00:49,833 --> 02:00:52,583
Every kid from my village wants to be Judge sir.

1505
02:00:53,083 --> 02:00:54,291
And now...

1506
02:00:54,791 --> 02:00:58,291
...it's my turn.

1507
02:01:00,750 --> 02:01:01,125
What's all this?

1508
02:01:01,625 --> 02:01:05,125
Tell me. Tell me.

1509
02:01:07,041 --> 02:01:12,458
Guru, I don't think this gun's ever going to fire again.

1510
02:01:12,958 --> 02:01:15,541
But this one will, won't it.

1511
02:01:16,041 --> 02:01:18,166
Don't worry, sir.

1512
02:01:18,666 --> 02:01:20,708
Just keep sending your orders from across the border.

1513
02:01:21,208 --> 02:01:23,708
We're here for you.

1514
02:01:24,208 --> 02:01:28,958
This time India will be mortified in front of the entire world.

1515
02:01:29,458 --> 02:01:31,333
I promise you that.

1516
02:01:31,833 --> 02:01:34,916
Goodbye.

1517
02:01:35,416 --> 02:01:37,500
Lokesh..

1518
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:41,583
..I want you to turn this shooting championship into a bloodbath..

1519
02:01:42,083 --> 02:01:45,708
..which should take India ages to wipe the stains.

1520
02:01:46,208 --> 02:01:47,916
But, sir, what about Gyani.

1521
02:01:48,416 --> 02:01:53,625
Nothing's more important than your objective.

1522
02:01:54,125 --> 02:01:58,291
Rascal, you forgot...my brother's competing here.

1523
02:01:58,791 --> 02:02:02,291
If I give my life for the sake of friendship..

1524
02:02:02,791 --> 02:02:06,291
..then, I can take one too.

1525
02:04:29,375 --> 02:04:29,875
All the best.

1526
02:04:30,375 --> 02:04:32,541
You will win.

1527
02:04:33,041 --> 02:04:36,541
Go.

1528
02:04:51,375 --> 02:04:53,166
You can shed all the blood you want.

1529
02:04:53,666 --> 02:04:57,166
But you cannot stop this mission from completing.

1530
02:05:06,916 --> 02:05:11,708
Try and save the one you killed my comrades for.

1531
02:05:12,208 --> 02:05:14,291
India's just one step away..

1532
02:05:14,791 --> 02:05:16,041
..from winning its first Gold Medal..

1533
02:05:16,541 --> 02:05:17,625
..in the World Shooting Championship.

1534
02:05:18,125 --> 02:05:22,375
The entire responsibility lies on Gyani Singh, from Uttar Pradesh.

1535
02:05:22,875 --> 02:05:23,625
We've to watch whether..

1536
02:05:24,125 --> 02:05:27,625
..Gyani can win this round and fulfill India's dreams.

1537
02:06:18,333 --> 02:06:22,166
India! India! India! India! India!

1538
02:06:22,666 --> 02:06:26,750
India! India! India! India! India!

1539
02:06:27,250 --> 02:06:30,750
India! India! India! India! India!

1540
02:06:55,125 --> 02:06:58,625
Oh my, God!

1541
02:07:10,875 --> 02:07:14,375
Pali!

1542
02:07:25,125 --> 02:07:25,750
Pali!

1543
02:07:26,250 --> 02:07:28,458
What has happened?

1544
02:07:28,958 --> 02:07:30,041
Brother...

1545
02:07:30,541 --> 02:07:34,208
...everything's fine now.

1546
02:07:34,708 --> 02:07:38,125
Now no one can stop you from achieving your dreams.

1547
02:07:38,625 --> 02:07:39,041
Pali!

1548
02:07:39,541 --> 02:07:41,333
I've made things right.

1549
02:07:41,833 --> 02:07:43,375
You're bleeding so much.

1550
02:07:43,875 --> 02:07:44,958
Doctor!

1551
02:07:45,458 --> 02:07:46,916
Doctor! - No.

1552
02:07:47,416 --> 02:07:48,166
Let me go.

1553
02:07:48,666 --> 02:07:50,041
No, don't be crazy.

1554
02:07:50,541 --> 02:07:52,541
I won't let you die. - Gyani.

1555
02:07:53,041 --> 02:07:55,958
Try to understand.

1556
02:07:56,458 --> 02:07:59,375
Guddi's alone. - What?

1557
02:07:59,875 --> 02:08:01,125
Sister-in-law Guddi..

1558
02:08:01,625 --> 02:08:05,125
I have to go.

1559
02:08:09,666 --> 02:08:12,166
My brother.. - Pali.

1560
02:08:12,666 --> 02:08:17,125
Promise me...that you will fulfill your dream.

1561
02:08:17,625 --> 02:08:21,041
I will always be with you.

1562
02:08:21,541 --> 02:08:23,208
Pali.

1563
02:08:23,708 --> 02:08:24,750
Pali, no..

1564
02:08:25,250 --> 02:08:27,208
Go and win.

1565
02:08:27,708 --> 02:08:28,750
Someone call the doctor.

1566
02:08:29,250 --> 02:08:30,333
Doctor.

1567
02:08:30,833 --> 02:08:31,708
Pali.

1568
02:08:32,208 --> 02:08:35,708
Pali. Get up.

1569
02:08:38,208 --> 02:08:40,625
Pali!

1570
02:08:41,125 --> 02:08:42,250
Pali!

1571
02:08:42,750 --> 02:08:43,208
Pali!

1572
02:08:43,708 --> 02:08:45,250
Pali! Get up.

1573
02:08:45,750 --> 02:08:48,041
Pali! Get up.

1574
02:08:48,541 --> 02:08:50,375
Pali, don't fool around with me.

1575
02:08:50,875 --> 02:08:52,166
Look, we've to return to the village together.

1576
02:08:52,666 --> 02:08:53,500
What are you doing?

1577
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:54,625
Get up.

1578
02:08:55,125 --> 02:08:57,750
Get up.

1579
02:08:58,250 --> 02:08:59,375
Major..

1580
02:08:59,875 --> 02:09:01,833
Major...he likes to fool around.

1581
02:09:02,333 --> 02:09:03,541
He'll get up...now.

1582
02:09:04,041 --> 02:09:05,125
Now..

1583
02:09:05,625 --> 02:09:07,666
Pali, get up.

1584
02:09:08,166 --> 02:09:09,000
Why are you crying?

1585
02:09:09,500 --> 02:09:11,083
Why are you crying?

1586
02:09:11,583 --> 02:09:12,041
He'll get up.

1587
02:09:12,541 --> 02:09:12,750
He'll get up now.

1588
02:09:13,250 --> 02:09:15,250
He's a big ham!

1589
02:09:15,750 --> 02:09:17,083
Get up.

1590
02:09:17,583 --> 02:09:20,083
Pali. Get up.

1591
02:09:20,583 --> 02:09:21,625
Pali. Get up.

1592
02:09:22,125 --> 02:09:23,416
Pali!

1593
02:09:23,916 --> 02:09:25,291
Pali!

1594
02:09:25,791 --> 02:09:29,291
Pali!

1595
02:09:42,416 --> 02:09:45,916
Pali!

1596
02:09:56,916 --> 02:09:59,250
No, son.

1597
02:09:59,750 --> 02:10:01,708
No, Gyani.

1598
02:10:02,208 --> 02:10:04,166
Don't cry.

1599
02:10:04,666 --> 02:10:07,625
Don't cry.

1600
02:10:08,125 --> 02:10:11,166
If you shatter now..

1601
02:10:11,666 --> 02:10:14,750
If you shatter now...

1602
02:10:15,250 --> 02:10:20,875
..the millions of dreams will shatter along with Pali's.

1603
02:10:21,375 --> 02:10:23,041
You will have to get up.

1604
02:10:23,541 --> 02:10:25,666
You will have to get up.

1605
02:10:26,166 --> 02:10:28,333
You have to get up and go win that gold.

1606
02:10:28,833 --> 02:10:33,458
And go make your friendship immortal.

1607
02:10:33,958 --> 02:10:37,333
Everything will be okay.

1608
02:10:37,833 --> 02:10:41,333
God!

1609
02:12:36,833 --> 02:12:39,041
Finally, India's dreams have come true.

1610
02:12:39,541 --> 02:12:40,416
Gyani's won the Gold Medal..

1611
02:12:40,916 --> 02:12:43,375
..in the 25 meters Rapid Fire Pistol round series 1..

1612
02:12:43,875 --> 02:12:47,375
..and created history.

1613
02:14:13,500 --> 02:14:17,000
Gyani. - Pali.

1614
02:15:01,708 --> 02:15:04,291
"My companion."

1615
02:15:04,791 --> 02:15:07,166
"You're my friend."

1616
02:15:07,666 --> 02:15:13,041
"Our bond is the most unique."

1617
02:15:13,541 --> 02:15:15,916
"My companion."

1618
02:15:16,416 --> 02:15:19,000
"You're my friend."

1619
02:15:19,500 --> 02:15:23,000
"Our bond is the most unique."

1620
02:15:33,916 --> 02:15:36,416
"May you always stay ahead.."

1621
02:15:36,916 --> 02:15:42,166
"..and your sagas follow you."

1622
02:15:42,666 --> 02:15:45,166
"May you always stay ahead.."

1623
02:15:45,666 --> 02:15:48,166
"..and your sagas follow you."

1624
02:15:48,666 --> 02:15:51,041
"Even if our paths are separate.."

1625
02:15:51,541 --> 02:15:54,000
"..but all I think about I you."

1626
02:15:54,500 --> 02:15:56,916
"Even if our destinations are different.."

1627
02:15:57,416 --> 02:15:59,833
"..but all I think about I you."

1628
02:16:00,333 --> 02:16:03,833
"Crossing all barriers...breaking every limit."

1629
02:16:23,750 --> 02:16:26,291
"You're my trial."

1630
02:16:26,791 --> 02:16:29,166
"You're my obsession."

1631
02:16:29,666 --> 02:16:34,916
"Our bond is the most unique."

1632
02:16:35,416 --> 02:16:37,958
"My companion."

1633
02:16:38,458 --> 02:16:40,916
"You're my friend."

1634
02:16:41,416 --> 02:16:46,583
"Our bond is the most unique."

1635
02:16:47,083 --> 02:16:49,625
"My companion."

1636
02:16:50,125 --> 02:16:52,583
"You're my friend."

1637
02:16:53,083 --> 02:16:58,875
"Our bond is the most unique."
