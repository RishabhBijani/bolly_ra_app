1
00:01:57,084 --> 00:02:08,416
"O beloved...!!
!!Listen to the tune of love.!!

2
00:02:10,542 --> 00:02:16,666
"I've chosen you...
you choose me too."

3
00:02:16,667 --> 00:02:23,083
"O beloved..."
"Listen to the tune of love."

4
00:02:49,584 --> 00:02:55,291
"No girl ever takes the first step."

5
00:02:56,084 --> 00:03:07,999
"She never utters a word
unless her heart's helpless."

6
00:03:09,084 --> 00:03:12,416
"My heart's crossed
all limits of happiness."

7
00:03:12,417 --> 00:03:15,666
"I wish to spend rest
of my life with you."

8
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:25,541
"Come weave these
dreams of love with me."

9
00:03:25,542 --> 00:03:30,291
"O beloved..."
"Listen to the tune of love."

10
00:03:32,334 --> 00:03:38,666
"I've chosen you...
you choose me too."

11
00:03:38,667 --> 00:03:42,166
"O beloved..."

12
00:04:08,667 --> 00:04:10,541
Come inside, please.

13
00:04:11,792 --> 00:04:12,916
When did you two get married?

14
00:04:15,459 --> 00:04:16,666
Marriage?

15
00:04:16,917 --> 00:04:18,333
Well...it was winter.

16
00:04:18,334 --> 00:04:20,499
People were wearing warm clothes.

17
00:04:21,917 --> 00:04:23,708
Why don't you tell them if you know?

18
00:04:23,709 --> 00:04:25,166
25th October, doctor.

19
00:04:25,334 --> 00:04:27,291
25th October!

20
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:30,083
How long have you two been married?

21
00:04:30,084 --> 00:04:31,249
4 years!
- 4 years!

22
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,374
4 years!

23
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:34,041
When did the problem begin?

24
00:04:34,042 --> 00:04:36,124
l mean...tell me from the beginning.

25
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:38,916
Doctor, this is happened 4 years ago.

26
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:41,624
l was a small kid.
- Kid? Her?

27
00:04:43,834 --> 00:04:45,083
Can I talk?

28
00:04:46,334 --> 00:04:47,749
l was very young.

29
00:04:48,042 --> 00:04:50,291
l loved a boy called Raja Awasthi.

30
00:04:50,709 --> 00:04:52,791
This man tricked
me into marrying him..

31
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:53,666
What?

32
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:55,166
Can I talk?

33
00:04:55,584 --> 00:04:57,791
Can I share my view..

34
00:04:58,709 --> 00:05:00,541
You talk,
Doctor, l am going to sit there.

35
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,916
Let me know.

36
00:05:02,459 --> 00:05:04,541
See...what did l say?

37
00:05:05,084 --> 00:05:06,416
This is what happens.

38
00:05:06,584 --> 00:05:08,541
It's okay.
- Dr. Goswami, l am a doctor too..

39
00:05:08,542 --> 00:05:09,583
..and in my professional opinion..

40
00:05:09,584 --> 00:05:12,166
..my wife is suffering
from a bipolar disorder.

41
00:05:12,709 --> 00:05:15,124
She has anxiety issues,
acute hysteria.

42
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:15,958
Thyroid problems.

43
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:18,041
We got all the tests
done for thyroid..

44
00:05:18,042 --> 00:05:20,249
..the results were negative.
You..

45
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,666
Go ahead and lie...go on.

46
00:05:26,209 --> 00:05:27,416
Hormonal issues.

47
00:05:27,417 --> 00:05:29,958
You know,
some days she's absolutely fine.

48
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:31,791
And then suddenly she's grieving.

49
00:05:31,792 --> 00:05:33,666
Some days she gets furious
over trivial matters..

50
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,166
..and suddenly she's fine again.

51
00:05:35,167 --> 00:05:37,333
You know, if she starts quarrelling,
she can't stop.

52
00:05:37,334 --> 00:05:39,291
And if she's fine...
she's fine.

53
00:05:39,292 --> 00:05:41,791
See the pattern, it's like a..
- Mr. Sharma.

54
00:05:41,792 --> 00:05:44,541
According to this, all the
women in the world are bipolar.

55
00:05:44,542 --> 00:05:47,458
And I think,
according to your description..

56
00:05:47,459 --> 00:05:49,416
..she seems absolutely fine.

57
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:51,499
Mrs. Sharma, you tell us.

58
00:05:52,459 --> 00:05:55,041
Doctor, I'll tell
you from the beginning.

59
00:05:56,084 --> 00:05:57,791
My name is Tanuja Trivedi.

60
00:05:57,792 --> 00:06:00,083
l am a resident of Kanpur,
Virana Road.

61
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,624
l loved a boy.

62
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:04,666
But this man fell in love with me.

63
00:06:04,667 --> 00:06:06,708
He tricked me into marrying him..

64
00:06:06,709 --> 00:06:08,041
..and brought me to London.

65
00:06:08,042 --> 00:06:09,541
l thought he's a successful doctor..

66
00:06:09,542 --> 00:06:11,958
..but, he barely makes ends meet.

67
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:13,708
Earlier, we lived at South Hall.

68
00:06:13,709 --> 00:06:15,916
Where people hang their
underwear outside their home.

69
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:18,458
He finally changed home
after I kept insisting.

70
00:06:18,459 --> 00:06:20,541
We lived outside London,
in the country.

71
00:06:20,542 --> 00:06:21,458
Except for 5 pigeons..

72
00:06:21,459 --> 00:06:25,541
..and 3 raccoons,
l don't see a single soul out there.

73
00:06:26,084 --> 00:06:28,416
Calm down, dear.
Please take this.

74
00:06:28,709 --> 00:06:31,041
So...was he always like this?

75
00:06:31,459 --> 00:06:33,166
He wasn't always like this.

76
00:06:33,167 --> 00:06:35,083
The first year was nice.

77
00:06:35,084 --> 00:06:37,499
There was love,
excitement, relationship..

78
00:06:38,084 --> 00:06:40,583
We would go out,
have candle-night dinner.

79
00:06:40,584 --> 00:06:42,208
Drink beer in the pub.

80
00:06:42,209 --> 00:06:44,166
But slowly he started
showing his true colors.

81
00:06:44,167 --> 00:06:45,791
Everything just went 'poof'.

82
00:06:45,792 --> 00:06:47,041
Went where?

83
00:06:47,042 --> 00:06:50,166
What?
- l mean...it disappeared.

84
00:06:50,667 --> 00:06:52,499
Vanished.
- Vanished.

85
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,541
What should l do for excitement?

86
00:06:54,542 --> 00:06:57,708
I can dance..
- You think you can dance, Manu Sharma.

87
00:06:57,709 --> 00:06:58,791
Have you seen your condition?

88
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:00,458
There's no meat left on your bones.

89
00:07:00,459 --> 00:07:02,083
This man's growing like a ginger.

90
00:07:02,084 --> 00:07:03,208
Sprouting from all directions.

91
00:07:03,209 --> 00:07:05,083
l wasn't exactly Hrithik Roshan
before we got married.

92
00:07:05,084 --> 00:07:07,333
l was always like this.
- You were like this.

93
00:07:07,334 --> 00:07:09,999
No personality or sense of humor.

94
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,541
So...you could've
married Raju Srivastav.

95
00:07:12,792 --> 00:07:14,374
Look, I can give her a stable life..

96
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:15,541
..l can't crack jokes.

97
00:07:15,542 --> 00:07:18,416
He can never crack jokes,
he's the ultimate boring man.

98
00:07:18,417 --> 00:07:20,541
Ask him about his weekend plans,
and he'll say..

99
00:07:20,542 --> 00:07:22,041
..there's a 25% discount at Tesco..

100
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:23,208
..let's go shopping.

101
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:25,083
Let's go for a stroll around the lake.
lf I ask him for a party..

102
00:07:25,084 --> 00:07:27,958
..then he calls four of his friends
from llT along with their wife.

103
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:30,166
There's not much
difference between them..

104
00:07:30,167 --> 00:07:31,541
..and my aunty from Rampur.

105
00:07:31,542 --> 00:07:33,208
l had such a happening life in lndia..

106
00:07:33,209 --> 00:07:35,208
..but he's completely
messed up my life.

107
00:07:35,209 --> 00:07:36,166
What?

108
00:07:36,167 --> 00:07:38,666
Messed up
- What?

109
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:42,041
lt means...destroyed.
- Destroyed.

110
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:46,666
Destroyed.

111
00:07:47,709 --> 00:07:51,999
l never...even made a
cup of tea for my father.

112
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,958
But l washed this man's clothes.

113
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:56,958
Cooked for him.
He said, start a children's créche..

114
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:58,208
..to keep yourself busy.

115
00:07:58,209 --> 00:08:00,666
l did that too.
But he still doesn't respect me.

116
00:08:01,334 --> 00:08:02,916
l thought he'll change.

117
00:08:03,459 --> 00:08:05,124
lt'll juice up our life.

118
00:08:05,709 --> 00:08:07,458
A girl has so many dreams

119
00:08:07,459 --> 00:08:09,291
when she agrees
for a love-marriage.

120
00:08:10,917 --> 00:08:13,999
But l think l love him,
but I stopped liking him.

121
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:16,541
l think l love him like a mammal.

122
00:08:17,167 --> 00:08:18,291
Like a Homo-sapien.

123
00:08:18,292 --> 00:08:19,458
Stop this.

124
00:08:19,459 --> 00:08:21,166
lt's all a lie, absurd.

125
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,458
lt was never a love-marriage.

126
00:08:22,459 --> 00:08:23,583
We had an arranged marriage.

127
00:08:23,584 --> 00:08:25,083
And why did you think l will change?

128
00:08:25,084 --> 00:08:27,166
Did we meet on some bridge,
with my arms open wide?

129
00:08:27,167 --> 00:08:28,541
l was formally dressed,
when l came to see her..

130
00:08:28,542 --> 00:08:30,291
..along with my parents.
- That was a nice pair of clothes.

131
00:08:30,292 --> 00:08:32,333
So, l did come to your house.
- Please let him speak.

132
00:08:32,334 --> 00:08:34,499
We got married with
the consent of her parents.

133
00:08:35,584 --> 00:08:38,041
And I am no fruit to juice-up again.

134
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:42,041
Dr. Moris, how many different
ways can one say "l Love You".

135
00:08:42,042 --> 00:08:43,166
No spark! No spark!

136
00:08:43,167 --> 00:08:45,041
l am a man, not a lighter.

137
00:08:45,042 --> 00:08:46,916
And let me tell you about her spark.

138
00:08:46,917 --> 00:08:49,916
She hit my friend Mathur's wife
on the head with a coke bottle.

139
00:08:49,917 --> 00:08:51,291
People stopped visiting us.

140
00:08:51,292 --> 00:08:53,416
And the Créche...
Ask her how did that shut down?

141
00:08:53,417 --> 00:08:54,958
She gave alcohol to the
children to shut them up.

142
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:57,291
There was a police case.
l was nearly arrested.

143
00:08:57,625 --> 00:09:00,083
And this woman flirts around
in the pub...with foreigners.

144
00:09:00,084 --> 00:09:02,916
Right in front of me!
- Who else should l do it with? You?

145
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:06,416
l tried that once.
But you're just a dead body.

146
00:09:06,584 --> 00:09:07,666
Why shouldn't l flirt around?

147
00:09:07,667 --> 00:09:09,458
There's a 5000 year old history
of atrocities against woman.

148
00:09:09,459 --> 00:09:11,708
Have l been committing atrocities
against women for 5000 years!

149
00:09:11,709 --> 00:09:12,916
Will you take revenge only on me?

150
00:09:12,917 --> 00:09:14,708
Men are doing it.
All men are alike.

151
00:09:14,709 --> 00:09:17,083
As long as you get relationship..
- What relationship?

152
00:09:17,084 --> 00:09:19,333
lt happened back in 2013.

153
00:09:19,334 --> 00:09:21,041
He remembers that.
He remembers that. - Yes.

154
00:09:21,209 --> 00:09:23,083
That was the only thing
worth remembering. - Calm...

155
00:09:23,084 --> 00:09:25,416
Calm down.
- Please!

156
00:09:26,459 --> 00:09:28,291
Please calm down!

157
00:09:28,292 --> 00:09:29,458
Sorry.

158
00:09:31,834 --> 00:09:35,041
Doctor, l think he's a pervert.

159
00:09:36,459 --> 00:09:38,416
The way he stares at girls..

160
00:09:38,417 --> 00:09:40,416
What do you mean?
- lt's like he'll devour them.

161
00:09:40,417 --> 00:09:41,458
He's a lecher.

162
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:43,874
l.. l never even gave
that look to my wife.

163
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,499
Why would l look at
other girls like that?

164
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,583
When he came to Kanpur, to see me..

165
00:09:47,584 --> 00:09:49,083
..he kissed me when l was asleep.

166
00:09:49,084 --> 00:09:51,291
Without my consent.
Without my awareness.

167
00:09:51,292 --> 00:09:53,166
Ask him...ask him.

168
00:09:53,334 --> 00:09:55,374
l was descent enough to tell you that.

169
00:09:55,542 --> 00:09:57,291
You didn't know..
- You were drunk like a log. - No.

170
00:09:57,292 --> 00:09:59,249
You were drunk..
- Calm down.

171
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:00,083
Calm down.

172
00:10:00,084 --> 00:10:02,124
Calm down. Calm down.
Please calm down.

173
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:04,208
Did you kiss me or not?
- Yes, I did! l did!

174
00:10:04,209 --> 00:10:06,083
l made a big mistake.
- Calm down!

175
00:10:06,084 --> 00:10:07,083
Calm down please.

176
00:10:07,084 --> 00:10:09,541
l won't spare you!

177
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:11,083
Crazy girl... witch.

178
00:10:11,084 --> 00:10:12,749
Relax.
- Catch her!

179
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:16,541
You're making a big mistake,
Dr. Goswami by letting this woman out.

180
00:10:16,542 --> 00:10:18,083
She has ruined my life.

181
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:20,833
Now she'll ruin other lives too.
This is illegal. Leave me.

182
00:10:20,834 --> 00:10:24,124
Tanu, stop them.

183
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:26,208
Leave me.

184
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:36,541
Hello.
- Tanu! Good news!

185
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,041
You've become an aunty.

186
00:11:39,792 --> 00:11:40,958
Boy or girl?

187
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:43,291
Girl... Little girl.

188
00:11:43,292 --> 00:11:45,541
And the father's right here.
He's stuffing his face.

189
00:11:45,542 --> 00:11:47,666
Hello, feed me too,
l gave birth to her.

190
00:11:47,667 --> 00:11:50,083
Where are you?
How's your husband?

191
00:11:52,792 --> 00:11:55,124
Where's Mr. Sharma?

192
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:58,083
He's in the mental asylum.
- What?

193
00:11:58,084 --> 00:12:01,041
If he behaves madly
in front of a psychiatrist..

194
00:12:01,042 --> 00:12:02,916
..then they're bound
to think he's crazy.

195
00:12:03,292 --> 00:12:04,791
They kept him there.

196
00:12:04,792 --> 00:12:06,791
What are you saying?
l don't understand.

197
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:08,749
Where are you now?

198
00:12:11,042 --> 00:12:13,916
l am in London.
- l know you're in London.

199
00:12:13,917 --> 00:12:15,666
But are you okay.

200
00:12:17,209 --> 00:12:18,499
l don't know.

201
00:12:19,542 --> 00:12:21,791
l am thinking about
going back to Kanpur.

202
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:29,958
Place the mask over
your nose and mouth..

203
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:33,666
..and tighten by pulling the straps.

204
00:12:46,167 --> 00:12:47,416
Here...go.

205
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:48,833
Poor.

206
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:49,833
Yes, come on.

207
00:12:49,834 --> 00:12:51,666
Be careful,
the children might spill it.

208
00:12:51,667 --> 00:12:53,208
We'll distribute
it to everyone out here.

209
00:12:53,209 --> 00:12:54,291
Come.

210
00:12:54,709 --> 00:12:56,624
Hello.
- Where's the pickle?

211
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:57,666
Who is it?

212
00:12:57,834 --> 00:12:58,916
Tanu speaking.

213
00:12:58,917 --> 00:12:59,916
Sister-in-law!

214
00:13:00,709 --> 00:13:01,874
Hello.

215
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:04,541
You forgot all about
us after shifting to London.

216
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:06,916
Hold on, sister-in-law.

217
00:13:06,917 --> 00:13:08,374
The network's really bad in here.

218
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:11,041
You know,
it's an auspicious day today.

219
00:13:11,042 --> 00:13:13,333
And look who called.

So please get him out.

223
00:13:20,459 --> 00:13:21,958
No, no..
- What happened?

224
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:22,916
Nothing.

225
00:13:22,917 --> 00:13:24,416
St. Benedict Mental Asylum..

226

lt's been 2-3 days and he doesn't
have his phone or credit card.

232
00:13:36,292 --> 00:13:37,583
Oh, God!

233
00:13:37,584 --> 00:13:40,666
The only son of Sharma
Family is in a mental asylum.

234
00:13:40,667 --> 00:13:42,999
Please get him out as soon as you can.

235
00:13:48,084 --> 00:13:49,541
Was it your sister-in-law?
- Yes.

236
00:13:49,917 --> 00:13:51,291
What's wrong with you?

237
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,499
Speak up.

238
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,541
Manu...
- Manu what?

239
00:13:56,542 --> 00:13:57,999
Manu what?

240
00:13:58,375 --> 00:13:59,916
He's in the mental asylum.

241
00:13:59,917 --> 00:14:01,666
Passengers, your attention please.

242
00:14:01,667 --> 00:14:04,208

l even have a 5 year old daughter.

247
00:14:18,709 --> 00:14:21,083
l couldn't decide on
any one for a long time.

248
00:14:21,084 --> 00:14:22,499
But then father passed away.

249
00:14:22,834 --> 00:14:24,541
And my elder brother
refused to support me.

250
00:14:24,542 --> 00:14:26,374
l left collage because of money.

251
00:14:26,709 --> 00:14:28,874
l needed someone to
look after the family.

252
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:30,291
Do you miss me?

253
00:14:31,584 --> 00:14:32,333
Yes.

254
00:14:32,334 --> 00:14:34,249
Not often, only sometimes.

255
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:37,458
When?

256
00:14:46,834 --> 00:14:50,708

Mom, dad...

Sister-in-law, Tanu is back.

259
00:14:54,709 --> 00:14:56,416
Aunty is back.

00:14:56,417 --> 00:14:59,291

Keep it.
- You think l'll charge you money.

264
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,333

265
00:15:15,334 --> 00:15:18,291
Time and age ruined everything.

00:15:36,542 --> 00:15:38,666
Who was that, dear?
- He was a friend.

275
00:15:38,667 --> 00:15:40,666
Friend?
She has a rickshaw driver friend.

276
00:15:40,667 --> 00:15:42,666
How are you, dear?

277
00:15:42,667 --> 00:15:44,541
That rickshaw-puller is your friend.

278
00:15:44,542 --> 00:15:46,083
How can she have a rickshaw
puller as a friend?

279
00:15:46,084 --> 00:15:47,041
Be quiet.

280
00:15:47,042 --> 00:15:48,458
Dear, how did you
come so suddenly?

281
00:15:48,459 --> 00:15:50,583
Is everything okay?
- Yes, everything alright.

282
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:51,791
How is Manu?

283
00:15:52,209 --> 00:15:53,624
He's in the mental asylum.

284
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:54,916
What?

285
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,791
But.. - We learnt a
wonderful dance just for you.

286
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:02,458
lt's better than Katrina.

287
00:16:02,459 --> 00:16:04,124
Later.

288
00:16:06,584 --> 00:16:09,041
Who's that guy?

289
00:16:09,709 --> 00:16:12,041
Chintu, from Rampur.

290
00:16:12,042 --> 00:16:13,458
What's he doing?

291
00:16:13,459 --> 00:16:14,583
After you got married..

292
00:16:14,584 --> 00:16:16,916
..brother rented out your room to him.

293
00:16:17,084 --> 00:16:18,666
He's been living here
for the past 6 months..

294
00:16:18,667 --> 00:16:20,416
..without paying a single penny.

295
00:16:20,417 --> 00:16:21,916
He's studying law at the university.

296
00:16:21,917 --> 00:16:22,833
Every time we ask him to vacate..

297
00:16:22,834 --> 00:16:24,291
..he threatens us with the law.

298
00:16:24,292 --> 00:16:27,833
l suggested that we shut him out.

299
00:16:27,834 --> 00:16:30,958
But that idiot,
uses a ladder to climb up.

300
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:33,291
He's a fool.

301
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:34,916
But you don't get into all this, dear.

302
00:16:34,917 --> 00:16:37,124
Freshen up and let's have some tea.

303
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,416
Son...

304
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:41,791
3 days.

305
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:43,541
l want you to vacate
the room in 3 days.

306
00:16:43,542 --> 00:16:46,958
Otherwise...or l'll pass
judgment on you on Virana Road.

307
00:16:48,334 --> 00:16:51,624
lf Lucknow is romantic,
Kanpur is industrial

308
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:53,083
Listen carefully.

309
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,291
Don't forget to applaud.

310
00:16:55,667 --> 00:16:58,791
lf Lucknow is romantic,
Kanpur is industrial

311
00:16:58,792 --> 00:17:00,583
Bareli is naughty

312
00:17:00,584 --> 00:17:02,749
Then Rampur is witty!

313
00:17:03,667 --> 00:17:05,291
l won't leave easily.

314
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:07,374
You're free to give yourjudgment.

315
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:09,958
He's a big fool.

316
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:11,583
You don't get into this.

317
00:17:11,584 --> 00:17:13,416
Neetu...check the lentil.

318
00:17:15,417 --> 00:17:19,874
Sister-in-law,
you picked out all the cottage cheese.

319
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:22,958
There's no cottage-cheese
left in this dish.

320
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,374
They finished off the cottage-cheese.

321
00:17:25,542 --> 00:17:28,083
Don't force me to tell them about you.

322
00:17:28,084 --> 00:17:29,416
Be quiet.

323
00:17:29,709 --> 00:17:32,041
Sister-in-law, make some tea for me.

324
00:17:32,042 --> 00:17:33,624
Then go sleep.

325
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:35,749
You're neither watching
the video nor letting me watch it.

326
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,416
You're only making this worse.

327
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:43,291
Yeah. Yeah. - Look at that.
Have you been there?

328
00:17:43,542 --> 00:17:45,416
Hold on.
- Look at that.

329
00:17:45,584 --> 00:17:47,166
Wait.

330
00:17:47,417 --> 00:17:49,833
Hello. - Pappi.
Have you reached London?

331
00:17:49,834 --> 00:17:51,416
Did you get brother
out of the mental asylum?

332
00:17:51,417 --> 00:17:53,958
Sister-in-law,
the ticket cost 60,000 rupees..

333
00:17:53,959 --> 00:17:57,999
..so it didn't feel right to
head to the mental asylum directly.

334
00:17:58,167 --> 00:18:00,166
So I thought...
l am on the Thames right now.

335
00:18:00,167 --> 00:18:01,333
Are you crazy?

336
00:18:01,334 --> 00:18:03,333
Do you know what a mental asylum is?

337
00:18:03,334 --> 00:18:04,416
Be quiet.

338
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,749
Do you know what it means?

339
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:09,458
Yes, sister-in-law.
- So get him out.

340
00:18:09,667 --> 00:18:12,541
And text me as soon as you do.
- Yes.

341
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:15,749
Look at that.

342
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,749
l heard a lot about you, until now.

343
00:18:20,084 --> 00:18:21,541
We never got a chance to meet.

344
00:18:22,459 --> 00:18:25,374
You know, Tanu you're the
Batman of this neighborhood.

345
00:18:25,542 --> 00:18:27,083
We only hear stories about you.

346
00:18:27,417 --> 00:18:29,499
l heard there were two
grooms in your marriage.

347
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,166
Shots were fired too.

348
00:18:32,709 --> 00:18:35,083
Such sad eyes.

349
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:36,916
Where did you get those?

350
00:18:38,459 --> 00:18:40,041
How about some tea, sister?

351
00:18:40,042 --> 00:18:42,416
Are you just being formal,
or do you respect me as one.

352
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,624
l also have a bottle.

353
00:18:48,292 --> 00:18:49,999
Sign here?
- Yes, sir.

354
00:18:51,459 --> 00:18:52,749
You can take him now, sir.

355
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,166
Thank you.
- Welcome.

356
00:19:08,792 --> 00:19:10,541
The beard suits you.

357
00:19:13,334 --> 00:19:14,791
What kind of clothes are you wearing?

358
00:19:15,042 --> 00:19:16,749
Didn't you get the
ones with the stripes?

359
00:19:17,834 --> 00:19:19,874
His humor is running.

360
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:21,541
Are you okay?

361
00:19:21,542 --> 00:19:23,833
Brother, l am in love.

362
00:19:24,792 --> 00:19:26,249
Thank you. Thank you.

363
00:19:26,667 --> 00:19:28,874
Remember that girl in
Jassi's marriage. Komal.

364
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:31,374
She's given the nod.

365
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:37,041
Look...two crazy
guys are playing chess.

366
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:39,624
Now you have to help me get married.

367
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:41,333
After all, l am 34 years old.

368
00:19:41,334 --> 00:19:43,333
l have needs too. Try to understand.

369
00:19:43,334 --> 00:19:45,708
This is what makes a
man turn criminal. Understand.

370
00:19:45,959 --> 00:19:47,708
Taxi!
- Stop. Stop.

371
00:19:47,709 --> 00:19:48,749
Astrid Kemp, please.

372
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,416
l told Komal's family..

373
00:19:50,417 --> 00:19:52,249
..that l am very close
to the Sharma family.

374
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:55,374
And uncle's booked a
shop for me in Greater Noida.

375
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:57,749
And he'll leave 1 million for me.

376
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:00,458
Oh my...what a beautiful house.

377
00:20:00,459 --> 00:20:01,541
ls it rented?

378
00:20:01,792 --> 00:20:03,874
l think l'll have to elope with Komal.

379
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:05,124
What do you say?

380
00:20:05,292 --> 00:20:07,124
lf her family doesn't agree..

381
00:20:07,417 --> 00:20:09,291
..then that's my last resort.

382
00:20:09,292 --> 00:20:11,249
Hear my plan.
The plan is like this..

383
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,833
The plane will land in Delhi, okay.

384
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,166
And from Delhi we'll
head straight to Punjab..

385
00:20:15,167 --> 00:20:17,999
Speak softly.
- Okay.

386
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,791
From Delhi, we'll take a bus..

387
00:20:20,792 --> 00:20:22,458
..and head straight to Punjab.
Okay.

388
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:26,458
Now yourjob is to talk
to Komal's parents in Punjabi.

389
00:20:26,459 --> 00:20:29,541
How? Well...like you do normally?
Hi...hello.

390
00:20:29,959 --> 00:20:32,041
This way they will feel comfortable.

391
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:35,458
All well if they say yes..

392
00:20:35,459 --> 00:20:37,041
..if not, l'll elope with the girl.

393
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:40,291
And then...

394
00:20:40,459 --> 00:20:42,124
Shut up!

395
00:20:42,459 --> 00:20:43,749
Are you crazy?

396
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:45,499
Do you see my condition!

397
00:20:45,709 --> 00:20:47,749
This is what happens
to a man post-marriage.

398
00:20:48,417 --> 00:20:49,958
l was in a mental asylum for 5 days.

399
00:20:49,959 --> 00:20:52,583
Do you want to go there too?
Do you?

400
00:20:53,584 --> 00:20:55,374
Crazy fool wants to get married.

401
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,374
Tanu. How much longer will you take?

402
00:21:04,792 --> 00:21:06,583
Hurry up, dear.

403
00:21:06,584 --> 00:21:08,416
The boy and his family
will be here soon.

404
00:21:11,084 --> 00:21:13,416
Tanu. The boy and his
family will be here soon.

405
00:21:13,417 --> 00:21:16,458
You should see him too.
How is Ankita looking?

406
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,624
Neetu, have the sweetmeats arrived.

407
00:21:28,542 --> 00:21:30,541
So you're out, beloved.

408
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:35,708
Give the kids some space to walk,
he might drop the glasses.

409
00:21:35,709 --> 00:21:36,624
Try these.

410
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:40,624
He's such a fool. Whenever we
have guest, he's washing his clothes.

411
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:44,416
Do you have to do that now?
- l have to.

412
00:21:44,417 --> 00:21:47,458
Mister, these days hair threading
is available in Kanpur too.

413
00:21:47,459 --> 00:21:48,624
You have a big patch.

414
00:21:50,459 --> 00:21:52,583
There's a clinic next to the lake.

415
00:21:52,584 --> 00:21:54,833
They charge 10,000
and guarantee long hair.

416
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:57,166
May be.

417
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,583
Tanu?

418
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,666
Hello.

419
00:22:21,209 --> 00:22:23,666
She's our daughter. Tanu.

420
00:22:23,667 --> 00:22:25,458
She recently returned from London.

421
00:22:25,459 --> 00:22:27,583
London
- Yes, London.

422
00:22:27,792 --> 00:22:31,374
You see, out there everything is open.

423
00:22:31,792 --> 00:22:33,916
Open...you see.

424
00:22:36,292 --> 00:22:37,999
So who is the boy here?

425
00:22:39,459 --> 00:22:40,916
Who is the boy!

426
00:22:43,459 --> 00:22:46,499
What do you do for a living?

427
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:51,166
l..
- l!

428
00:22:52,334 --> 00:22:55,083
l work for a lT Firm in Hyderabad.

429
00:23:02,084 --> 00:23:03,124
lT...

430
00:23:03,125 --> 00:23:05,749
ldiot they all work
for an IT firm, huh!

431
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:08,416
They all work in a computer shop.

432
00:23:08,417 --> 00:23:11,333
Why do you want to get married?

433
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:17,083
Have you ever had a girlfriend?

434
00:23:17,459 --> 00:23:20,791
Have you ever been to a club?

435
00:23:22,959 --> 00:23:26,249
Ankita, my dear little Susie.

436
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,958
lt's nothing.

437
00:23:27,959 --> 00:23:30,624
Your life has become boring.

438
00:23:31,417 --> 00:23:33,291
And for that you don't need to..

439
00:23:33,292 --> 00:23:36,708
..get this 70 kilos
of burden on top of you.

440
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:41,374
You just need to break the monotony.

441
00:23:43,709 --> 00:23:45,249
Do something exciting.

442
00:23:45,417 --> 00:23:46,374
Anything.

443
00:23:46,375 --> 00:23:47,874
Run away from home with someone.

444
00:23:47,875 --> 00:23:50,083
lf you can't find someone,
then run away alone.

445
00:23:50,375 --> 00:23:51,458
But do something.

446
00:23:51,459 --> 00:23:54,041
Let there be light, let there be life.

447
00:23:56,792 --> 00:23:59,374
She's humiliated us, let's go.

448
00:23:59,375 --> 00:24:03,833
Mister..
Listen...please..

449
00:24:03,834 --> 00:24:06,208
At least have a glass of water.

450
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:11,249
You're back..

451
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:19,374
Now we all suffer.
- Listen to me, brother.

452
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:27,249
Will you stop laughing?

453
00:24:29,542 --> 00:24:29,874
Papa...

454
00:24:29,875 --> 00:24:30,874
l want a divorce.

455
00:24:31,084 --> 00:24:32,583
Go ahead if you want to.

456
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:34,874
Someday l'll get furious and.

457
00:24:34,875 --> 00:24:35,708
But why?

458
00:24:36,834 --> 00:24:39,624
There's nothing left
between us to talk.

459
00:24:40,625 --> 00:24:42,374
We fight over every trivial thing.

460
00:24:42,959 --> 00:24:44,666
She doesn't understand, neither do I.

461
00:24:45,167 --> 00:24:46,291
Uncle's been drinking.

462
00:24:46,292 --> 00:24:48,874
And this mental asylum
incident was just too much.

463
00:24:49,334 --> 00:24:52,083
How did you land in the mental asylum?

464
00:24:52,084 --> 00:24:55,208
l can't make break
bread for him at midnight.

465
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:58,249
What more can I do? I'll
keep it aside, they'll eat it cold.

466
00:24:58,750 --> 00:24:59,458
Mannu.

467
00:24:59,625 --> 00:25:01,416
l'm was being tortured
for the past 4 years.

468
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:03,708
Don't forget to eat.
- We will.

469
00:25:03,875 --> 00:25:04,958
We all are.

470
00:25:04,959 --> 00:25:08,333
Your wife won't come feed you. I am
not destined to have a daughter-in-law.

471
00:25:08,334 --> 00:25:13,249
Look at me...l've been
enduring it for 40 years.

472
00:25:14,209 --> 00:25:17,208
And l am sure, so is your mother.

473
00:25:18,667 --> 00:25:21,833
Who will clean all the
dirty plates in the sink?

474
00:25:21,834 --> 00:25:23,624
So..
- So what?

475
00:25:24,834 --> 00:25:26,041
Manage it.

476
00:25:26,375 --> 00:25:28,999
And then...there's this.

477
00:25:29,667 --> 00:25:33,624
Sometimes with water...or with soda.

478
00:25:33,625 --> 00:25:35,291
And sometimes neat.

479
00:25:36,459 --> 00:25:38,916
What do you think will
happen after divorce?

480
00:25:38,917 --> 00:25:43,291
Either you will spend
the rest of your life alone.

481
00:25:43,292 --> 00:25:45,374
All the lights in the
rooms are switched on.

482
00:25:45,375 --> 00:25:47,208
All the lights are on.

483
00:25:47,209 --> 00:25:49,791
You'll get bored...with living alone.

484
00:25:49,792 --> 00:25:51,749
Or...you'll get married again.

485
00:25:52,917 --> 00:25:55,333
And after the second marriage..

486
00:25:56,125 --> 00:26:01,083
..do you think she
will make you happy?

487
00:26:01,084 --> 00:26:03,083
How can we clean
it with the lights off?

488
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:04,833
You're too much.

489
00:26:07,959 --> 00:26:10,749
Son...it's the rule of life.

490
00:26:12,875 --> 00:26:16,999
A man and a woman are
supposed to fall in love.

491
00:26:17,917 --> 00:26:19,333
Then getting married..

492
00:26:19,334 --> 00:26:21,458
..and then,
getting bored of each other.

493
00:26:22,292 --> 00:26:23,499
That's right.

494
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:28,874
That's why I say...
endure it for as long as you can.

495
00:26:28,875 --> 00:26:31,791
And when you give up.

496
00:26:32,417 --> 00:26:33,833
What happened?

497
00:26:33,834 --> 00:26:34,958
Save electricity.

498
00:26:34,959 --> 00:26:36,208
l say divorce her.

499
00:26:36,209 --> 00:26:38,041
You're like a closed door
and sister-in-law is like the breeze.

500
00:26:38,042 --> 00:26:39,374
You two can never get along.

501
00:26:39,375 --> 00:26:41,291
I told you before this
marriage will never last.

502
00:26:41,625 --> 00:26:44,124
You can't temper
lentil with ajinamoto.

503
00:26:44,417 --> 00:26:45,708
Look, a criminal.

504
00:26:46,042 --> 00:26:48,833
Mister. Where can l get a divorce?

505
00:26:48,834 --> 00:26:50,708
l'll show you.
There's Faisal.

506
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:52,708
There he is.
Faisal.

507
00:26:52,709 --> 00:26:55,249
Brother Faisal has
a record of 2500 divorces.

508
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:57,833
Once he got a couple divorced
on the following day of their wedding.

509
00:26:57,834 --> 00:26:59,083
Come.

510
00:26:59,625 --> 00:27:01,499
Greeting, brother.
- Get going.

511
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,749
Sit down.

512
00:27:06,084 --> 00:27:10,208
Mister, I want to
send a divorce notice.

513
00:27:10,209 --> 00:27:11,916
Of course. Just say the word.

514
00:27:11,917 --> 00:27:14,624
Brother..
Think about it once.

515
00:27:16,375 --> 00:27:18,958
l mean...think about it once.

516
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,291
So...which notice should I send her?

517
00:27:22,292 --> 00:27:25,374
Divorce notice orjust notice?

518
00:27:26,042 --> 00:27:26,958
What?

519
00:27:26,959 --> 00:27:28,374
Well, the divorce notice means..

520
00:27:28,375 --> 00:27:31,249
..everything's finalized...
marriage over!

521
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:39,333
But, with just a notice
you still have some chance left.

522
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:42,916
Take my advice,
and just send her a notice.

523
00:27:42,917 --> 00:27:45,249
This is just the beginning.
You're the emotional type.

524
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:48,166
You can never say "Divorce!
Divorce! Divorce!"

525
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:53,416
And you see...marriage
is an expensive game.

526
00:27:53,792 --> 00:27:54,833
And divorce.

527
00:27:54,834 --> 00:27:57,666
Well, you can get one
for as cheap as 250- rupees.

528
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,416
Name?

529
00:27:59,417 --> 00:28:01,416
Hold on.

530
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,916
Should l call him?
- Yes.

531
00:28:10,917 --> 00:28:12,499
Say sorry?
- Yes.

532
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,916
Say "Call that stupid fool".

533
00:28:15,917 --> 00:28:18,166
Call that stupid fool

534
00:28:18,167 --> 00:28:18,958
Here.

535
00:28:24,084 --> 00:28:26,458
Here, Tanu. Have some sweets.

536
00:28:26,459 --> 00:28:28,874
l cleared my final year of law.

537
00:28:28,875 --> 00:28:31,416
Chintu, you didn't call me sister.

538
00:28:31,417 --> 00:28:32,333
Today is a good day.

539
00:28:32,334 --> 00:28:35,499
Sister...there's a letter for you.

540
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,041
Son, have some.

541
00:28:37,042 --> 00:28:39,083
Soon l'll have your room too.

542
00:28:44,167 --> 00:28:45,874
There's a letter too.

543
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,458
Read it out...loudly.

544
00:28:48,875 --> 00:28:50,541
My dear Tanu.

545
00:28:50,542 --> 00:28:55,458
l never imagined that l'll
be sending this letter to you.

546
00:28:55,459 --> 00:28:58,166
But things have gone too far now.

547
00:28:58,167 --> 00:29:00,708
You've crossed all limits.

548
00:29:00,709 --> 00:29:02,624
But there's still time.

549
00:29:02,625 --> 00:29:06,083
lf you mend your ways and apologies..

550
00:29:06,084 --> 00:29:10,083
..then l am ready to forgive you.

551
00:29:10,084 --> 00:29:12,333
Waiting for your call.

552
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:14,166
Yours truly, Manu.

553
00:29:14,167 --> 00:29:16,041
lt's from brother-in-law.

554
00:29:19,542 --> 00:29:22,333
Son, do you only speak like that,
or do you write like that too.

555
00:29:22,334 --> 00:29:24,041
No, l write clearly.

556
00:29:24,292 --> 00:29:26,583
Then write him a letter in red.

557
00:29:26,584 --> 00:29:29,999
l am done respecting you.
ldiot!

558
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,874
Go.

559
00:29:32,709 --> 00:29:35,374
Chintu, you became a lawyer today..

560
00:29:35,375 --> 00:29:37,583
..and you also got your first case.

561
00:29:37,584 --> 00:29:40,374
Come on, get your bike.

562
00:29:41,209 --> 00:29:44,666
l'll show you all of Batman's legends.

563
00:29:49,459 --> 00:29:53,541
"O Beloved.."

564
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:58,458
"O Beloved...l'm bored of
singing all those painful songs."

565
00:29:58,459 --> 00:30:03,208
"Now there's rock-n-roll
playing in my heart."

566
00:30:03,209 --> 00:30:12,291
"Beloved Move on."
"Move on. Move on. Move on."

567
00:30:17,125 --> 00:30:21,291
"Beloved Move on."

568
00:30:21,709 --> 00:30:30,374
"Move on...on...on...on.."

569
00:30:31,417 --> 00:30:37,708
"Why look for another stranger?"

570
00:30:40,667 --> 00:30:48,124
"Why look for another story?"

571
00:30:49,542 --> 00:30:56,833
"The heart's happy wandering around."

572
00:30:56,834 --> 00:31:00,833
"So why look for a place to stay."

573
00:31:01,417 --> 00:31:05,333
"Why look for a place to stay."

574
00:31:06,042 --> 00:31:15,416
"Beloved Move on."
"Move on. Move on. Move on."

575
00:31:15,417 --> 00:31:18,624
"Move on."

576
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,499
"Beloved Move on."

577
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:32,666
"Move on...on...on...on.."

578
00:31:34,375 --> 00:31:39,749
"Whenever l start a new world."

579
00:31:43,584 --> 00:31:49,499
"l'll also find a new God."

580
00:31:52,542 --> 00:31:59,749
"lf I don't find someone capable."

581
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:07,999
"Then l'll be God myself."

582
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:18,541
"Beloved Move on."
"Move on. Move on. Move on."

583
00:32:18,542 --> 00:32:25,249
"O Beloved...l'm bored of
singing all those painful songs."

584
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:30,083
"Now there's rock-n-roll
playing in my heart."

585
00:32:30,084 --> 00:32:58,541
"Beloved Move on."
"Move on. Move on. Move on."

586
00:32:58,542 --> 00:33:01,333
"Move on."

587
00:33:08,042 --> 00:33:11,458
Let me introduce you
to the villain of my story.

588
00:33:14,667 --> 00:33:16,708
Chintu, do l look okay?

589
00:33:21,042 --> 00:33:22,124
What happened?

590
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:25,583
Don't just stand there, come on.

591
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,499
After this we'll
go get something to eat

592
00:33:47,209 --> 00:33:48,249
Hello

593
00:33:53,209 --> 00:33:55,333
The moustache looks nice on you,
Awasthi

594
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:58,916
You've turned quite spiritual.
- Yes

595
00:33:59,959 --> 00:34:03,666
l took my mind of you and into God.

596
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:05,916
Good

597
00:34:05,917 --> 00:34:07,499
You should keep yourself busy

598
00:34:09,292 --> 00:34:10,458
How's the doctor?

599
00:34:12,417 --> 00:34:13,916
How are husbands?

600
00:34:16,375 --> 00:34:19,249
Don't know.
l'll tell you by next year

601
00:34:19,917 --> 00:34:20,791
Really?

602
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:23,083
So you're taking the leap too

603
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:24,249
Yes.

604
00:34:25,375 --> 00:34:27,624
Finally l found a girl I like

605
00:34:28,209 --> 00:34:29,833
Oh dear!

606
00:34:30,959 --> 00:34:34,333
So my ship sank close to the shore

607
00:34:35,875 --> 00:34:39,041
Now that I am back,
you're leaving

608
00:34:41,667 --> 00:34:42,833
Well...anyway

609
00:34:44,209 --> 00:34:46,541
Chintu, let's go.
- Yes

610
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:51,083
See you brother

611
00:34:51,084 --> 00:34:54,041
Hey boy..
- Yes, brother?

612
00:34:55,709 --> 00:34:56,708
Who are you?

613
00:34:56,709 --> 00:34:59,374
Me... Shoulder!
- Who?

614
00:34:59,875 --> 00:35:00,874
Shoulder

615
00:35:00,875 --> 00:35:03,124
You know...the breed of boys.

616
00:35:03,125 --> 00:35:05,083
We come into the picture
when girls are very sad.

617
00:35:05,084 --> 00:35:07,249
Fed up of all her relations.

618
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:11,624
When you shunned her,
that doctor gave her his shoulder.

619
00:35:11,959 --> 00:35:13,916
Now when the doctor shunned her,
I gave her mine.

620
00:35:13,917 --> 00:35:15,624
And when I do the same,
you can offer her yours.

621
00:35:15,625 --> 00:35:18,958
I'll take your leave.
Madam has places to go.

622
00:35:19,209 --> 00:35:20,874
Hey...
- Yes brother?

623
00:35:22,459 --> 00:35:24,166
Stay within your limits, son.

624
00:35:25,375 --> 00:35:26,958
Or you'll end up hurt

625
00:35:31,834 --> 00:35:37,749
You think your wife will jump out of
the phone if you keep staring at it?

626
00:35:40,875 --> 00:35:43,166
Look...shall l tell
you where you went wrong?

627
00:35:43,667 --> 00:35:45,541
The day sister-in-law realizes..

628
00:35:45,709 --> 00:35:48,833
..she will come running
and apologies to you.

629
00:35:50,209 --> 00:35:51,333
And Listen..

630
00:35:51,875 --> 00:35:53,374
Have some pity on poor guys like us.

631
00:35:53,375 --> 00:35:55,083
Talk to Komal's family.

632
00:35:55,084 --> 00:35:57,208
Please...
Do you want me to beg?

633
00:35:57,209 --> 00:36:00,208
Please..
- Fine, I'll talk to them. Sit.

634
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:03,333
You don't care at all

635
00:36:05,042 --> 00:36:06,874
Sorry Pappi.
l've made you all sad.

636
00:36:07,792 --> 00:36:09,166
No seriously.

637
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:11,208
There's a lecture at Delhi
University day after tomorrow.

638
00:36:11,209 --> 00:36:12,166
Okay.

639
00:36:12,167 --> 00:36:13,833
We'll head for Chandigarh
right after that.

640
00:36:13,834 --> 00:36:15,249
Really?
- Yes.

641
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:15,916
Wonderful.

642
00:36:15,917 --> 00:36:18,083
And you can fulfill your dream
of getting married. - Of course.

643
00:36:18,459 --> 00:36:19,541
That's more like it.

644
00:36:19,542 --> 00:36:22,874
My marriage will be an
example for your marriage.

645
00:36:23,084 --> 00:36:24,916
And just watch how it's done.

646
00:36:24,917 --> 00:36:27,041
You will be uncle in a year.

647
00:36:27,042 --> 00:36:29,333
For instance,
there are two types ofArithmia.

648
00:36:29,334 --> 00:36:31,541
The bi-cardia and the tri-cardia.

649
00:36:31,709 --> 00:36:34,958
Bi-cardia, where the heart
rate is less than 60 beats per minute.

650
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:37,791
And tri-cardia where
the heart rate is..

651
00:36:37,792 --> 00:36:39,333
..more than 100 beats per minute.

652
00:36:39,334 --> 00:36:41,999
Both cause symptomatic
problems like these.

653
00:36:46,709 --> 00:36:48,458
lts...

654
00:36:53,042 --> 00:36:56,833
Very rare that you see
a phenomena, like this.

655
00:36:56,834 --> 00:37:02,958
l am sure it's also very dangerous.

656
00:37:03,375 --> 00:37:04,708
So..

657
00:37:05,792 --> 00:37:08,916
We're very lucky to have
Dr. Radheshyam Agarwal..

658
00:37:08,917 --> 00:37:09,958
..who is an expert on this subject..

659
00:37:09,959 --> 00:37:11,541
..and who has agreed
to speak on my behalf.

660
00:37:11,542 --> 00:37:13,083
Dr. Radheshyam Agarwal!

661
00:37:19,042 --> 00:37:20,791
Dr. Agarwal, please come.

662
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,416
l told you about the test,
remember. Now go.

663
00:37:35,417 --> 00:37:36,999
Get your physical done.

664
00:37:38,667 --> 00:37:40,499
Oh God!

665
00:37:46,667 --> 00:37:47,999
Any question?

666
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,916
Sir, which is the
more common phenomena?

667
00:37:50,917 --> 00:37:52,833
Bi-cardia or tri-cardia?

668
00:38:00,625 --> 00:38:01,916
Good question.

669
00:38:01,917 --> 00:38:03,708
You're a good question.

670
00:38:05,125 --> 00:38:06,124
Next.

671
00:38:25,625 --> 00:38:28,708
Doctor, why are there more
heart-related diseases in India..

672
00:38:28,709 --> 00:38:30,124
..than in any other country?

673
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,666
What's your name?
- Anirudh.

674
00:38:36,667 --> 00:38:38,458
3rd year student.
- Anirudh.

675
00:38:38,792 --> 00:38:40,249
Anirudh, good question.

676
00:38:40,584 --> 00:38:42,458
But your question hurt me.

677
00:38:43,542 --> 00:38:45,458
lt's paining me.

678
00:38:46,709 --> 00:38:48,958
Excuse me, doctor.
- Yes, doctor.

679
00:38:48,959 --> 00:38:51,249
Can you check what's happening?
- Yeah, sure,

680
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:53,166
Here?
- Here?

681
00:38:54,125 --> 00:38:55,249
Doctor.
Doctor, relax.

682
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:56,958
His question..
- Doctor, relax.

683
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:59,083
Lie down.

684
00:38:59,084 --> 00:39:01,291
Lie down.
Doctor, relax.

685
00:39:01,292 --> 00:39:02,208
Doctor.

686
00:39:02,584 --> 00:39:06,666
Doctor, relax.
Somebody call the ambulance, please.

687
00:39:09,584 --> 00:39:11,666
She will apology...

688
00:39:11,834 --> 00:39:14,041
...when she will realize.

689
00:39:20,375 --> 00:39:22,041
You fool...

690
00:39:22,209 --> 00:39:23,499
Are you crazy?

691
00:39:23,834 --> 00:39:26,041
What were you doing
with your arms spread out?

692
00:39:26,375 --> 00:39:28,666
This is no place to be Shahrukh Khan.

693
00:39:29,042 --> 00:39:30,958
l thought..
- What did you think?

694
00:39:30,959 --> 00:39:33,083
That l am Manisha Koirala?

695
00:39:33,084 --> 00:39:35,333
Come on, Dhatto.
- Coming.

696
00:39:36,125 --> 00:39:39,041
Shameless...good for nothing perverts.

697
00:39:39,042 --> 00:39:41,833
We'll miss our bus.

698
00:39:42,709 --> 00:39:44,083
What happened?

699
00:39:44,667 --> 00:39:46,333
He was standing in
the middle of the pitch.

700
00:39:46,334 --> 00:39:48,291
l am injured now.
- Are you hurt?

701
00:39:48,292 --> 00:39:49,708
Old fool.

702
00:39:54,292 --> 00:39:56,083
Hurry up. Come on.

703
00:39:56,084 --> 00:39:57,916
Put the stretcher in the ambulance.

704
00:40:00,375 --> 00:40:01,541
Pappi.

705
00:40:01,834 --> 00:40:03,708
Come quickly.

706
00:40:03,875 --> 00:40:04,958
Come on.

707
00:40:06,125 --> 00:40:08,833
Sir, relax.
Sir..

708
00:40:09,709 --> 00:40:11,208
Quick quick

709
00:40:11,209 --> 00:40:12,833
Come on.

710
00:40:12,834 --> 00:40:14,041
Do you know what happened?

711
00:40:14,042 --> 00:40:15,666
Sir..

712
00:40:16,875 --> 00:40:17,999
l've been noticing that..

713
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,333
..the Sharma family
enjoys embarrassing me.

714
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:22,833
Listen to me.
Tanu is right here.

715
00:40:22,834 --> 00:40:23,999
l'll show you.

716
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,458
What? Who?

717
00:40:26,084 --> 00:40:27,083
Tanu.

718
00:40:27,084 --> 00:40:29,208
Oh, God!

719
00:40:33,917 --> 00:40:35,624
lsn't that, Tanu?
- Which one?

720
00:40:35,625 --> 00:40:38,083
That boy-cut.
That's not sister-in-law Tanu.

721
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:39,416
Aren't you wearing your glasses?

722
00:40:39,417 --> 00:40:41,958
Pappi, that's Tannu.
- She isn't.

723
00:40:41,959 --> 00:40:44,583
What if she is?
- And what if she isn't?

724
00:40:46,459 --> 00:40:49,416
Sister-in-law.
Sister-in-law. Sister-in-law. - Quiet.

725
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:51,624
How can she be Sister-in-law?

726
00:40:51,792 --> 00:40:53,874
Did she go back to college?

727
00:40:55,709 --> 00:40:58,624
Lovers like you cause
half the pollution in Delhi.

728
00:41:18,125 --> 00:41:20,874
How can you say she's
sister-in-law Tanu?

729
00:41:20,875 --> 00:41:22,416
That's someone else.

730
00:41:23,084 --> 00:41:24,291
She isn't?

731
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,249
And will you follow
anyone who looks like her?

732
00:41:28,584 --> 00:41:30,249
Go on.

733
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:32,291
Come on, let's go to lSBT.

734
00:41:32,459 --> 00:41:36,249
l see no hope, nor a face.

735
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:38,416
Death is inevitable.

736
00:41:38,417 --> 00:41:40,249
But why can't sleep at nights.

737
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:44,166
Very impressive Chintu!

738
00:41:47,042 --> 00:41:48,333
Who's it now?

739
00:41:48,334 --> 00:41:50,749
My soul mate.

740
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:52,833
Hello.
- Payal.

741
00:41:52,834 --> 00:41:55,166
Where are you?
- Kanpur.

742
00:41:55,167 --> 00:42:00,208
Listen...today is the
function for the kid.

743
00:42:00,209 --> 00:42:01,499
Everyone's so happy.

744
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:03,458
That's a good thing.

745
00:42:03,459 --> 00:42:05,208
Do you know who l met today?

746
00:42:05,209 --> 00:42:06,291
Awasthi.

747
00:42:06,292 --> 00:42:07,249
Raja.

748
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:09,374
He's grown a moustache now.

749
00:42:09,375 --> 00:42:10,666
He looks hot.

750
00:42:10,667 --> 00:42:12,833
Listen Tanu.

751
00:42:12,834 --> 00:42:14,999
Don't get yourself
in these hassles.

752
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:16,541
l am telling you because
l already am in one.

753
00:42:16,542 --> 00:42:18,958
Believe me, it's no use.
You feel really guilty.

754
00:42:18,959 --> 00:42:20,833
Guilty? Why?

755
00:42:20,834 --> 00:42:22,208
lsn't this Jassi's kid?

756
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,791
Yes...it's not.

757
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:28,999
l'll tell you
in detail when we meet.

758
00:42:29,209 --> 00:42:32,708
Tanu, come here soon.
Or else I'll die of guilt.

759
00:42:32,709 --> 00:42:35,249
You've made this really exciting.

760
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:36,749
She's Mr. Trivedi's daughter,
isn't she?

761
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:37,833
Yes.

762
00:42:37,834 --> 00:42:39,958
So why are you taking her around?

763
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:42,999
She's married.
- Are you her father-in-law?

764
00:42:43,375 --> 00:42:45,208
Mind your own business.

765
00:42:50,875 --> 00:42:52,416
Your moustache is beautiful.

766
00:43:01,334 --> 00:43:05,208
You know, perverts love
a book called Lolita.

767
00:43:05,667 --> 00:43:06,833
Have you read it?

768
00:43:07,625 --> 00:43:12,791
You see...a middle-aged man
keeps staring at a little girl.

769
00:43:13,209 --> 00:43:16,874
She wasn't even born when
you completed your graduation.

770
00:43:16,875 --> 00:43:19,333
Look, I'll lodge a
complaint with the police.

771
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:21,416
There are 1500 students here.

772
00:43:21,417 --> 00:43:23,166
lf they all slap you..

773
00:43:24,292 --> 00:43:26,958
Oh, God.
- Get out before she gets here.

774
00:43:27,584 --> 00:43:29,333
Oh, God.

775
00:43:29,334 --> 00:43:31,166
Don't look. Don't look.

776
00:43:36,417 --> 00:43:38,208
Hey come come

777
00:43:38,209 --> 00:43:40,833
This is a DTC bus.
Anyone can board it.

778
00:43:40,834 --> 00:43:42,708
Come on.
- Pahad Ganj bus depot.

779
00:43:42,709 --> 00:43:44,958
Come on.

780
00:43:44,959 --> 00:43:46,458
Keep your bag on your lap.

781
00:43:47,667 --> 00:43:48,833
Shut up.

782
00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:55,124
lf these people find out
we're following that girl..

783
00:43:56,917 --> 00:44:00,541
They will beat us black and blue.

784
00:44:01,084 --> 00:44:02,458
Whistle?

785
00:44:02,459 --> 00:44:03,833
You don't know what's a whistle?

786
00:44:03,834 --> 00:44:06,458
Remember those toy dolls we
used to play with when we were kids.

787
00:44:06,792 --> 00:44:09,208
And if you pressed that doll,
it would..

788
00:44:09,209 --> 00:44:10,041
Ticket?

789
00:44:10,542 --> 00:44:12,541
Staff.
- What staff?

790
00:44:12,875 --> 00:44:14,791
Delhi University,
don't you see?

791
00:44:14,792 --> 00:44:16,416
This is the DTC bus...

792
00:44:16,417 --> 00:44:18,374
No concession to any staff.

793
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:21,416
How much?
- 10.

794
00:44:21,417 --> 00:44:23,749
And how much for your windscreen?

795
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:25,749
You fool, one brick..

796
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:28,708
..and you'll lose
10,000 instead of 10.

797
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:30,333
Ticket?

798
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:37,041
Brother...if this girl finds
out we're following her..

799
00:44:37,042 --> 00:44:40,208
..then she will beat us to a pulp.

800
00:44:40,709 --> 00:44:42,208
You do understand that don't you?

801
00:44:42,209 --> 00:44:44,624
This one...our..

802
00:44:45,167 --> 00:44:47,541
It's called something
more crude in Punjabi.

803
00:44:47,834 --> 00:44:49,333
l..

804
00:44:49,334 --> 00:44:50,583
Ticket.

805
00:44:51,542 --> 00:44:53,208
Staff!

806
00:45:02,209 --> 00:45:04,374
Brother,
you didn't eat your almonds

807
00:45:11,084 --> 00:45:12,874
l'll need money today.

808
00:45:24,084 --> 00:45:25,583
Walk straight. Straight..

809
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:27,666
Don't look.

810
00:45:27,834 --> 00:45:28,708
What are you doing?

811
00:45:28,875 --> 00:45:31,083
We can pay you only 200

812
00:45:31,084 --> 00:45:33,333
Don't look at her.

813
00:45:33,334 --> 00:45:35,291
Okay how about 250?

814
00:45:35,292 --> 00:45:38,083
How much is that for?

815
00:45:46,625 --> 00:45:47,874
Look at this one

816
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:50,333
Sit carefully.

817
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,041
Keep your knees to yourself.

818
00:45:56,417 --> 00:45:58,749
Sit carefully.

819
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,208
Don't look at her.
- How's your stomach?

820
00:46:02,917 --> 00:46:05,208
What?
- How's your stomach?

821
00:46:05,375 --> 00:46:06,874
l kicked you the other day,
remember.

822
00:46:06,875 --> 00:46:08,166
Yes, it's fine.

823
00:46:08,792 --> 00:46:10,166
Thank you.

824
00:46:13,209 --> 00:46:17,583
Mister, why do l feel
like you're following me?

825
00:46:17,584 --> 00:46:18,874
No, it's not that.

826
00:46:22,334 --> 00:46:25,333
Just tell me who you're following.
Me or her?

827
00:46:25,334 --> 00:46:27,583
We've a bet going.

828
00:46:27,917 --> 00:46:29,541
No, it's not what you think.

829
00:46:29,542 --> 00:46:31,249
Stop the rickshaw.

830
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:32,874
Stop. Stop.

831
00:46:32,875 --> 00:46:35,624
Loveboy.
You say you're not following me.

832
00:46:35,625 --> 00:46:37,999
Get down.
- Listen to me.

833
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,249
You're mistaken.
l am not following you.

834
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:44,083
You look like my wife.
You look like my wife.

835
00:46:45,042 --> 00:46:46,124
Listen to me..

836
00:46:46,125 --> 00:46:47,541
Just listen to me..

837
00:46:48,375 --> 00:46:49,666
l am a doctor.

838
00:46:49,667 --> 00:46:51,374
Will you listen to me?

839
00:46:51,375 --> 00:46:54,791
My wife looks..
Look..

840
00:46:54,792 --> 00:46:57,333
You look like my wife.

841
00:46:57,334 --> 00:46:58,874
Wait..

842
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,791
Look. Take a look.

843
00:47:04,292 --> 00:47:07,208
Your wife does look like me.

844
00:47:07,417 --> 00:47:09,583
Normally we see this in films.

845
00:47:09,584 --> 00:47:12,041
I never imagined I
could have a lookalike.

846
00:47:12,042 --> 00:47:13,916
She does look a bit like her.

847
00:47:14,084 --> 00:47:15,708
But is she dead?

848
00:47:15,917 --> 00:47:16,958
No...

849
00:47:18,417 --> 00:47:20,458
Did she run away?
- No..

850
00:47:22,459 --> 00:47:23,708
She left me.

851
00:47:23,709 --> 00:47:26,333
We're getting divorced.
- Oh..

852
00:47:29,625 --> 00:47:31,041
That's sad.

853
00:47:31,042 --> 00:47:33,124
But, mister, the reality is..

854
00:47:33,125 --> 00:47:35,333
Your wife looks just like me..

855
00:47:35,334 --> 00:47:36,666
..but I am not your wife.

856
00:47:36,667 --> 00:47:38,083
My name is Kumari Kusum Sangwan..

857
00:47:38,084 --> 00:47:39,166
..and this is my friend Pinky.

858
00:47:39,167 --> 00:47:40,999
We study at Ramjas CoIlege,
Delhi University.

859
00:47:41,167 --> 00:47:43,624
l got admission through sport's quota.
l am a national level athlete.

860
00:47:43,625 --> 00:47:45,166
District Jhajjar, 12 45 07.

861
00:47:45,334 --> 00:47:47,291
And l won't give my phone number.

862
00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:50,666
No, l..

863
00:47:51,667 --> 00:47:53,208
l thought...

864
00:47:56,250 --> 00:47:57,874
Never mind, l am sorry.

865
00:47:59,667 --> 00:48:02,916
Mister...
- l want to say sorry too.

866
00:48:03,084 --> 00:48:04,999
l misunderstood you.

867
00:48:05,459 --> 00:48:07,999
l can't make you
happy like your wife.

868
00:48:08,417 --> 00:48:09,791
But if you ever want
to taste home-made food..

869
00:48:09,792 --> 00:48:11,208
..you can come see me.

870
00:48:11,209 --> 00:48:13,208
l bring lunch from home.

871
00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:18,041
Keep the lights on.

872
00:48:18,584 --> 00:48:20,124
l'm applying medicine.

873
00:48:20,334 --> 00:48:23,166
My knee's cracked-up.
Listen, its creaking.

874
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:25,999
Switch it on.

875
00:48:26,459 --> 00:48:27,874
You silly man!

876
00:48:28,042 --> 00:48:30,833
This is the first time
l got beaten up by a girl.

877
00:48:31,084 --> 00:48:34,708
My entire personality
is completely shattered.

878
00:48:41,625 --> 00:48:42,374
Stop.

879
00:48:42,750 --> 00:48:44,291
Stop. Stop.
Stop. Stop. Stop.

880
00:48:44,292 --> 00:48:45,916
Stop. Stop. Stop.

881
00:48:45,917 --> 00:48:47,916
Turn around

882
00:48:48,167 --> 00:48:49,499
What? What? What? What?

883
00:48:49,709 --> 00:48:51,708
What?
What are you thinking?

884
00:48:52,125 --> 00:48:54,958
No. Not at all.

885
00:48:55,125 --> 00:48:55,916
No.

886
00:48:55,917 --> 00:48:57,874
This is called extra-marital affair.

887
00:48:57,875 --> 00:48:59,416
lllicit relation.

888
00:48:59,417 --> 00:49:01,624
lllegal affairs

889
00:49:04,334 --> 00:49:06,499
This is where it all begins.

890
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:08,166
No, no, don't laugh.

891
00:49:08,375 --> 00:49:10,583
You'll remember what
l said when you're in a jam.

892
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:12,916
No, don't to the dark path.

893
00:49:12,917 --> 00:49:14,499
Understand?
Don't.

894
00:49:18,875 --> 00:49:21,458
This is where it all begins.

895
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:25,666
Look.. You're head
over heels for that child.

896
00:49:25,667 --> 00:49:27,749
She's dancing around
because she passed.

897
00:49:30,667 --> 00:49:32,749
Who is it?
- Mr. Sharma.

898
00:49:32,750 --> 00:49:34,124
Here she comes.

899
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:36,999
l passed.

900
00:49:38,292 --> 00:49:40,208
l had no hope,
but l passed.

901
00:49:40,209 --> 00:49:41,708
This calls for a party.

902
00:49:41,709 --> 00:49:42,583
Party?

903
00:49:45,042 --> 00:49:48,041
Wow, we're going boating.

904
00:49:48,334 --> 00:49:51,791
Mister...you should pedal too.

905
00:49:51,792 --> 00:49:54,708
How am l supposed to when
you have broken my legs?

906
00:49:54,709 --> 00:49:55,874
What?

907
00:49:55,875 --> 00:49:59,166
There's a handle.
l'll pedal using this.

908
00:49:59,875 --> 00:50:03,374
lt's a wonderful ambiance, Mr. Sharma.
- Right.

909
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:04,791
Sing a song for me.

910
00:50:06,375 --> 00:50:08,958
l can't sing.
- Everyone can sing.

911
00:50:08,959 --> 00:50:11,333
l can't.
- Shall I?

912
00:50:11,334 --> 00:50:13,958
Of course.
- l learnt it on BBC radio.

913
00:50:18,375 --> 00:50:22,958
"l might be sentimental."

914
00:50:22,959 --> 00:50:27,499
"But don't get so judgmental."

915
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:31,374
"So what l am an old-school girl?

916
00:50:31,584 --> 00:50:34,208
Am l singing in accent?
- Haryanvi?

917
00:50:34,209 --> 00:50:37,749
No, American.
- No, not at all.

918
00:50:41,417 --> 00:50:46,124
"l might be sentimental."

919
00:50:46,750 --> 00:50:51,458
"But don't get so judgmental."

920
00:50:51,459 --> 00:50:55,291
"So what if l'm an old-school girl."

921
00:50:55,542 --> 00:51:00,624
"I am an old-school girl."

922
00:51:01,584 --> 00:51:06,958
"l might be sentimental."

923
00:51:06,959 --> 00:51:11,166
"But don't get so judgmental."

924
00:51:11,667 --> 00:51:15,583
"So what if l'm an old-school girl."

925
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:21,499
"I am an old-school girl."

926
00:51:41,959 --> 00:51:47,416
"Darling though we're
from different time-zones."

927
00:51:47,417 --> 00:51:52,916
"l still can call you
any time on your telephone."

928
00:51:52,917 --> 00:51:58,999
"But I really long...
for your handwritten letters."

929
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:03,541
"You.. baby those days are gone."

930
00:52:03,542 --> 00:52:07,541
"I love the smell of
your palm and your ink."

931
00:52:08,292 --> 00:52:13,499
"One letter from you just
makes me love your everything."

932
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:16,708
"All sweet nothings you don't write..

933
00:52:16,709 --> 00:52:18,541
"..between your lines."

934
00:52:18,542 --> 00:52:22,874
"My heart can hear
them every single time."

935
00:52:22,875 --> 00:52:27,583
"l might be sentimental."

936
00:52:27,834 --> 00:52:32,499
"But don't get so judgmental."

937
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:36,624
"So what if l'm an old-school girl."

938
00:52:36,625 --> 00:52:42,291
"I am an old-school girl."

939
00:53:02,792 --> 00:53:09,083
"l'll fight with the
world if it comes to that."

940
00:53:09,084 --> 00:53:13,999
"Be a big girl to prove I am right."

941
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:19,124
"But every time you say goodbye."

942
00:53:19,625 --> 00:53:20,999
"I swear to God.."

943
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,458
"I cry! l cry! l cry!"

944
00:53:23,459 --> 00:53:27,291
"I cry! l cry! Boy, I cry!"

945
00:53:27,292 --> 00:53:29,666
"l cry! l cry!"

946
00:53:29,667 --> 00:53:31,583
"Every time you say goodbye."

947
00:53:31,584 --> 00:53:32,499
"I swear to God.."

948
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:33,583
"I cry!

949
00:53:34,834 --> 00:53:37,291
"l might be sentimental."

950
00:53:37,459 --> 00:53:40,041
"But don't get so judgmental."

951
00:53:40,042 --> 00:53:43,416
"So what if l'm an old-school girl."

952
00:53:43,417 --> 00:53:47,916
"l might be sentimental."

953
00:53:48,709 --> 00:53:52,666
"But don't get so judgmental."

954
00:53:52,667 --> 00:53:55,916
"So what if l'm an old-school girl."

955
00:53:55,917 --> 00:53:58,833
"So what if l am an old-school girl."

956
00:53:58,834 --> 00:54:02,249
"I am an old-school girl."

957
00:54:03,875 --> 00:54:05,374
Mister, two glasses ofjuice.

958
00:54:05,542 --> 00:54:06,416
Mr. Sharma..
- Orange?

959
00:54:06,417 --> 00:54:07,666
Orange?
- Yes.

960
00:54:07,917 --> 00:54:08,999
Yes, orange juice.

961
00:54:09,750 --> 00:54:11,333
l am scared of dogs myself.

962
00:54:15,125 --> 00:54:17,333
Mr. Sharma, until now boys have been..

963
00:54:17,334 --> 00:54:19,958
..either my brothers or competition.

964
00:54:20,292 --> 00:54:22,749
I never had any other
kind of relation with them.

965
00:54:25,750 --> 00:54:28,291
l have lot of responsibility on me.

966
00:54:28,834 --> 00:54:30,624
People will say..

967
00:54:30,959 --> 00:54:33,708
Dhatto went to Delhi to be famous..

968
00:54:33,709 --> 00:54:35,249
..but she fell in love instead.

969
00:54:36,334 --> 00:54:38,208
You see...no other girl
will ever be allowed..

970
00:54:38,209 --> 00:54:39,749
..to leave Jhajjar again.

971
00:54:41,667 --> 00:54:44,333
My sister-in-law has
someone in mind for me.

972
00:54:44,709 --> 00:54:46,583
You were someone's husband.

973
00:54:47,750 --> 00:54:51,249
Let's end this right here.

974
00:54:52,209 --> 00:54:53,958
When it has no future..

975
00:54:54,292 --> 00:54:56,791
..there's no point in
going through all the trouble.

976
00:54:58,584 --> 00:55:00,083
Like they say..

977
00:55:00,459 --> 00:55:02,583
Precaution is better than cure.

978
00:55:04,709 --> 00:55:07,916
You see, I don't know myself
what's happening and why.

979
00:55:09,542 --> 00:55:11,791
But l..
- See you, Mr. Sharma.

980
00:55:12,625 --> 00:55:14,541
Keep them safe.

981
00:55:15,125 --> 00:55:17,083
l heard gold's getting expensive.

982
00:55:19,042 --> 00:55:24,208
"Every time you say goodbye."

983
00:55:24,542 --> 00:55:25,999
"I swear to God.."

984
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,208
"I cry! l cry! l cry!"

985
00:55:28,209 --> 00:55:32,249
"I cry! l cry! Boy, I cry!"

986
00:55:32,417 --> 00:55:34,416
"l cry!"

987
00:55:51,375 --> 00:55:52,333
For you.

988
00:55:54,042 --> 00:55:54,916
Here.

989
00:56:05,625 --> 00:56:07,083
She sent a divorce letter.

990
00:56:07,542 --> 00:56:10,083
Manu, l'll find someone better.

991
00:56:10,084 --> 00:56:12,583
lt's not too late for
you to get married again.

992
00:56:21,125 --> 00:56:24,083
Hello. ls that Manoj Sharma speaking?

993
00:56:24,959 --> 00:56:25,624
Yes, speaking.

994
00:56:25,625 --> 00:56:29,416
This is Tanuja's Lawyer,
advocate Arun Kumar Singh.

995
00:56:29,792 --> 00:56:31,541
l am sure you received the notice.

996
00:56:32,959 --> 00:56:33,624
Yes.

997
00:56:33,625 --> 00:56:36,958
Well, l was thinking about
giving you another piece of news.

998
00:56:36,959 --> 00:56:40,541
At your wedding, there was
another horse along with yours.

999
00:56:40,750 --> 00:56:42,541
So that horse is back.

1000
00:56:42,834 --> 00:56:45,374
You must have heard
about Raja Awasthi.

1001
00:56:46,917 --> 00:56:48,291
Yes, so don't forget.

1002
00:56:48,292 --> 00:56:49,708
So, l'm hanging up.

1003
00:56:50,209 --> 00:56:52,333
Mr. Trivedi.
Hold on.

1004
00:56:53,834 --> 00:56:55,916
Now listen to him.

1005
00:56:59,209 --> 00:57:00,291
Pappi.

1006
00:57:08,167 --> 00:57:09,749
Let's go ask him.

1007
00:57:10,292 --> 00:57:12,458
Him?
He's stealing electricity.

1008
00:57:13,375 --> 00:57:15,166
Sir.
- Sir?

1009
00:57:15,750 --> 00:57:17,958
Sir, what's Om Prakash
Sangwan's address?

1010
00:57:17,959 --> 00:57:21,249
Pocket B, 411/2...that one..

1011
00:57:21,417 --> 00:57:23,624
Strange, he knows it by-heart.

1012
00:57:24,125 --> 00:57:25,666
Yes, l am Om Prakash Sangwan.

1013
00:57:25,667 --> 00:57:26,999
Oh God..

1014
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,416
What do you want?
- Let's go. Come on.

1015
00:57:35,792 --> 00:57:37,124
Uncle.

1016
00:57:40,792 --> 00:57:43,124
Uncle, here's your 6 months' rent.

1017
00:57:43,375 --> 00:57:45,791
Uncle, last night l was in tears..

1018
00:57:45,792 --> 00:57:47,083
..while thinking about you.

1019
00:57:47,459 --> 00:57:49,499
l realized how l've wronged you.

1020
00:57:49,834 --> 00:57:51,666
ln the morning,
l went straight to the bank.

1021
00:57:51,667 --> 00:57:53,208
Took money from my FD..

1022
00:57:53,209 --> 00:57:55,041
..and came straight
to you with the money.

1023
00:57:55,042 --> 00:57:56,333
Keep the money.

1024
00:57:57,875 --> 00:57:59,791
Uncle, take my advice..

1025
00:57:59,792 --> 00:58:02,124
..and put some money away in a FD.

1026
00:58:02,375 --> 00:58:03,833
You don't have a son.

1027
00:58:03,834 --> 00:58:05,541
AIl you have is a daughter,
who is out of control.

1028
00:58:05,792 --> 00:58:07,666
lf you save some money..

1029
00:58:07,667 --> 00:58:09,749
..at least you won't
have to wander around.

1030
00:58:12,542 --> 00:58:15,083
What insolence is this?
- Exactly.

1031
00:58:15,084 --> 00:58:18,916
If you had been strict with
your daughter at the right time..

1032
00:58:18,917 --> 00:58:20,791
..then she wouldn't
have been in this mess.

1033
00:58:21,959 --> 00:58:24,916
Gunjan Talkies is screening
Aashiqui 2, matinee show.

1034
00:58:25,125 --> 00:58:26,541
AIong with Raja Awasthi.

1035
00:58:26,792 --> 00:58:30,416
Songs are being
sung...bangles are tinkling.

1036
00:58:31,334 --> 00:58:36,041
"Are you listening.."

1037
00:58:36,625 --> 00:58:40,416
"I am crying.."

1038
00:58:56,667 --> 00:59:01,208
Look, Manu.
l am not against love marriage at all.

1039
00:59:01,209 --> 00:59:03,458
l had a love marriage too.
- I see.

1040
00:59:03,459 --> 00:59:05,166
And on top of it, it was inter-caste.

1041
00:59:05,167 --> 00:59:06,999
l also have a small daughter.

1042
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,124
Great.

1043
00:59:08,125 --> 00:59:10,374
But there is a problem.

1044
00:59:11,125 --> 00:59:13,916
But I can't understand
what the problem is.

1045
00:59:13,917 --> 00:59:16,291
Normally there are problems
in a love marriage.

1046
00:59:20,875 --> 00:59:23,666
But...Manu, l would still say that..

1047
00:59:23,667 --> 00:59:27,291
..you should talk to Kusum once.

1048
00:59:28,542 --> 00:59:31,166
You see...if my sister's willing..

1049
00:59:31,167 --> 00:59:33,374
..that doesn't mean
we don't have a problem.

1050
00:59:33,375 --> 00:59:34,624
There's still a problem.

1051
00:59:34,625 --> 00:59:39,874
But only then can I tell
you what the problem is.

1052
00:59:45,584 --> 00:59:49,874
Manu, please talk to Kusum.

1053
00:59:49,875 --> 00:59:51,458
l'll be right back.

1054
00:59:53,542 --> 00:59:55,374
Keep the door open.

1055
01:00:15,375 --> 01:00:17,458
This isn't the first time
l've fallen in love, Kusum.

1056
01:00:18,750 --> 01:00:20,208
l was in love with someone before.

1057
01:00:21,084 --> 01:00:23,749
l've worn my wedding attire before,
ridden the horse before..

1058
01:00:24,125 --> 01:00:26,124
..and taken the nuptial
rounds with someone before.

1059
01:00:26,792 --> 01:00:29,291
l've laughed with someone
cried behind someone's back.

1060
01:00:29,584 --> 01:00:31,666
l lost trying to build a home.

1061
01:00:32,334 --> 01:00:33,458
And l lost so badly..

1062
01:00:34,750 --> 01:00:37,458
..that l strongly detest
this husband-wife relation.

1063
01:00:38,542 --> 01:00:39,708
But after l met you..

1064
01:00:39,709 --> 01:00:44,791
..I felt like I had the courage
to repeat this mistake again.

1065
01:00:46,209 --> 01:00:47,791
lf someone who's scared of love..

1066
01:00:47,792 --> 01:00:50,583
..falls in love again,
then it must be something special.

1067
01:00:51,125 --> 01:00:53,416
AIl l would like to say is..

1068
01:00:53,875 --> 01:00:56,458
l will love you, and keep you happy.

1069
01:00:57,334 --> 01:00:58,958
Support you in joy and sorrows.

1070
01:00:59,667 --> 01:01:01,916
And every time you
win a competition, Tanu..

1071
01:01:02,125 --> 01:01:03,458
Kusum.

1072
01:01:07,334 --> 01:01:10,583
See...l told you this
has happened before.

1073
01:01:10,792 --> 01:01:12,499
l've said these things before.

1074
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,708
But you happened to
me for the first time.

1075
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:24,416
Brother, there's an outbreak
of cholera in Delhi.

1076
01:01:24,625 --> 01:01:25,458
l see.

1077
01:01:25,459 --> 01:01:26,916
So be careful with the fritters.

1078
01:01:28,167 --> 01:01:30,499
And I told you...
there will be a problem.

1079
01:01:30,792 --> 01:01:32,999
There's always a problem
in love marriages.

1080
01:01:33,167 --> 01:01:34,374
See, there's a problem.

1081
01:01:34,542 --> 01:01:35,333
What?

1082
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,874
Well, my missus says
that he's a divorcee..

1083
01:01:38,875 --> 01:01:40,999
Which you already told me.

1084
01:01:42,459 --> 01:01:45,708
But I don't have an objection,
but my wife does.

1085
01:01:46,167 --> 01:01:47,541
And secondly...

1086
01:01:47,542 --> 01:01:51,291
She's already chosen Kusum..

1087
01:01:51,292 --> 01:01:53,583
..for one of her distant brother.

1088
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,249
He belongs from your side.

1089
01:01:56,417 --> 01:01:58,541
UP.
Take a look.

1090
01:01:59,542 --> 01:02:01,624
You might have seen him before.

1091
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:12,708
What's going on here?

1092
01:02:13,417 --> 01:02:15,541
Stop this.

1093
01:02:15,542 --> 01:02:18,749
Manu Sharma,
trying to be Shahrukh Khan, huh!

1094
01:02:18,750 --> 01:02:22,208
"This has happened before."

1095
01:02:22,209 --> 01:02:24,249
l'll tell you what happened before.

1096
01:02:24,542 --> 01:02:27,041
He tried to snatch your wife before.

1097
01:02:27,042 --> 01:02:30,041
And you left this poor boy hanging.

1098
01:02:30,042 --> 01:02:31,958
Last time he was busy
giving justification..

1099
01:02:31,959 --> 01:02:34,124
..but this time he'll
shoot first and talk later.

1100
01:02:34,125 --> 01:02:36,541
No. Why give any justification.

1101
01:02:36,542 --> 01:02:38,708
He'll shoot first and get going.

1102
01:02:38,709 --> 01:02:39,958
What justification?

1103
01:02:41,167 --> 01:02:42,291
Just shoot.

1104
01:02:42,292 --> 01:02:43,041
Why justification?

1105
01:02:43,792 --> 01:02:45,749
Pappi, what are you saying?
- Pappi?

1106
01:02:45,750 --> 01:02:47,666
He'll be taking your pappi (kiss) now.

1107
01:02:48,834 --> 01:02:51,083
She's supposed to be marrying him.

1108
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,666
l am feeling uneasy.

1109
01:02:56,625 --> 01:02:57,499
Pappi, brother!

1110
01:03:12,875 --> 01:03:15,958
You see,
women are like blending machine..

1111
01:03:15,959 --> 01:03:17,416
..and men are the fruit.

1112
01:03:17,417 --> 01:03:18,958
And for the last two weeks..

1113
01:03:18,959 --> 01:03:20,916
..we were hovering
around this machine.

1114
01:03:20,917 --> 01:03:24,333
One wrong move, and..

1115
01:03:25,167 --> 01:03:26,291
And that Raja Awashti.

1116
01:03:26,292 --> 01:03:29,291
He would've rained bullets on us.

1117
01:03:30,209 --> 01:03:31,583
l saved you.

1118
01:03:31,584 --> 01:03:33,666
Your father came
to us with the proposal.

1119
01:03:33,667 --> 01:03:36,208
Manu had no dearth of marriage proposals.
- Who is she yelling at in the morning?

1120
01:03:36,209 --> 01:03:39,916
There are plenty of them out there.

1121
01:03:39,917 --> 01:03:41,416
What's wrong, aunty?

1122
01:03:41,417 --> 01:03:42,916
We had to get you two married..

1123
01:03:42,917 --> 01:03:45,124
..because he was in love with you.

1124
01:03:45,959 --> 01:03:48,124
lt's the machine! The machine.

1125
01:03:48,125 --> 01:03:49,541
You've made a mess of things.

1126
01:03:49,542 --> 01:03:51,666
Mr. Sharma..
- This is my new coat.

1127
01:03:51,667 --> 01:03:53,833
l had warned you that
she isn't the right girl.

1128
01:03:53,834 --> 01:03:56,499
But you let her father
cloud yourjudgment.

1129
01:03:57,834 --> 01:04:00,124
She couldn't even abide by
the marriage for 4 years. - Who?

1130
01:04:00,125 --> 01:04:02,541
And look at that haircut she's got.

1131
01:04:02,542 --> 01:04:04,999
Look at those fangs.

1132
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,791
What are you blabbering?
- Where are you going?

1133
01:04:16,625 --> 01:04:18,041
Where's Chintu?

1134
01:04:18,584 --> 01:04:19,708
At the next shop.

1135
01:04:19,709 --> 01:04:21,083
Add some small pieces catechu.

1136
01:04:25,084 --> 01:04:27,374
Why did you tell
papa about me and Raja?

1137
01:04:27,750 --> 01:04:30,916
l even told your husband.
- Why?

1138
01:04:31,250 --> 01:04:31,874
Why?

1139
01:04:33,209 --> 01:04:34,374
Why did Ranjha die?

1140
01:04:34,959 --> 01:04:36,208
Why did Farhad die?

1141
01:04:37,084 --> 01:04:39,208
Why did Romeo stab himself?

1142
01:04:39,625 --> 01:04:42,749
And why do millions
of girls slit their veins?

1143
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:44,624
Love.

1144
01:04:45,667 --> 01:04:47,124
Tanu, l was in love with you.

1145
01:04:47,417 --> 01:04:48,666
You're crazy.

1146
01:04:48,959 --> 01:04:52,791
I am married.
- That's just your marital status.

1147
01:04:53,250 --> 01:04:54,999
But you're a still
a bachelor at heart.

1148
01:04:55,917 --> 01:04:57,999
And...I already sent the
divorce letter to your husband.

1149
01:04:58,834 --> 01:04:59,958
What?

1150
01:05:00,167 --> 01:05:02,374
When? - I sent it yesterday,
by Blue Dart.

1151
01:05:02,917 --> 01:05:04,499
l'm sure he's already received it.

1152
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,916
lt's only the seven
nuptial rounds, Tanu.

1153
01:05:07,709 --> 01:05:09,624
You won't mind taking them again.

1154
01:05:10,792 --> 01:05:13,041
l can give my life for you.

1155
01:05:13,667 --> 01:05:15,291
Hey...don't touch me.

1156
01:05:15,709 --> 01:05:17,041
This is the problem.

1157
01:05:17,459 --> 01:05:19,874
One smile...and you think
the girl's crazy about you.

1158
01:05:20,125 --> 01:05:22,374
Was I just a bike and
one liter of petrol for you?

1159
01:05:22,375 --> 01:05:24,041
Only good for taking
you to Raja Awasthi.

1160
01:05:24,834 --> 01:05:26,041
l warned you.

1161
01:05:26,042 --> 01:05:28,541
lt takes 2 hours to
get to Kanpur from Lucknow.

1162
01:05:28,542 --> 01:05:30,249
Raja..
- And you!

1163
01:05:31,167 --> 01:05:33,541
You husband-wife
have made my life bad.

1164
01:05:33,542 --> 01:05:35,708
Quietly get on the
bike and come with me.

1165
01:05:35,709 --> 01:05:36,833
And you..

1166
01:05:36,834 --> 01:05:38,666
You're just a shrimp, understand.

1167
01:05:40,292 --> 01:05:41,458
You..

1168
01:05:43,959 --> 01:05:46,666
Don't just insult me and leave,
Raja Awasthi.

1169
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,166
Finish me.
- Let go.

1170
01:05:48,167 --> 01:05:50,499
Just finish me for good.
l am a serpent.

1171
01:05:50,709 --> 01:05:52,958
l'll make your life miserable.

1172
01:05:52,959 --> 01:05:53,999
Wait...

1173
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:57,208
l will kill you.
- So kill me.

1174
01:05:58,875 --> 01:05:59,916
Stop.

1175
01:05:59,917 --> 01:06:01,749
He will shoot you.

1176
01:06:02,375 --> 01:06:03,916
l won't spare you.

1177
01:06:05,459 --> 01:06:06,624
Make another betel leaf.

1178
01:06:11,209 --> 01:06:13,999
Your courage has filled me with zest.

1179
01:06:14,917 --> 01:06:17,208
You aren't over your first wife yet..

1180
01:06:17,584 --> 01:06:19,249
..and already locking
horns with the bull.

1181
01:06:19,667 --> 01:06:21,083
Bull?

1182
01:06:21,709 --> 01:06:22,791
l have a brother.

1183
01:06:23,167 --> 01:06:25,291
Not Omi, another one.

1184
01:06:25,292 --> 01:06:28,124
When he was just 5,
he tried to wrestle a bull.

1185
01:06:28,125 --> 01:06:29,458
Got his bones broken.

1186
01:06:29,459 --> 01:06:31,583
After he got better,
he tried to wrestle it again.

1187
01:06:31,834 --> 01:06:33,124
And broke his bones again.

1188
01:06:33,542 --> 01:06:34,791
When he got better again..

1189
01:06:34,959 --> 01:06:37,749
..the fool tried to
lock horns with it again.

1190
01:06:38,459 --> 01:06:40,458
People say my brother is crazy.

1191
01:06:41,750 --> 01:06:44,458
But l like my brother.

1192
01:06:45,750 --> 01:06:46,916
And you too.

1193
01:06:48,500 --> 01:06:51,166
Mr. Sharma, l've decided..

1194
01:06:51,459 --> 01:06:53,333
..that I'm going to
take the bull by its horns.

1195
01:06:53,334 --> 01:06:54,833
We'll see what happens.

1196
01:06:56,459 --> 01:06:58,791
You do Iove me, don't you?

1197
01:07:01,792 --> 01:07:04,833
No, l'll believe it when
you say it convincingly.

1198
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:12,083
'Say it convincingly,
or l'm getting out of here.'

1199
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,124
Yes, l do.

1200
01:07:36,667 --> 01:07:38,874
Great, then let's go to Jhajjar.

1201
01:07:39,667 --> 01:07:41,208
Let's go deal with my family.

1202
01:07:41,584 --> 01:07:44,249
Don't be afraid if they beat you up.

1203
01:07:46,709 --> 01:07:50,249
lf you're doing a good deed,
then don't forget me.

1204
01:07:50,250 --> 01:07:51,958
Komal's getting married in 3 days.

1205
01:07:52,167 --> 01:07:53,249
Let's go to Chandigarh.

1206
01:07:53,250 --> 01:07:55,499
Pappi, if it's an emergency..

1207
01:07:55,500 --> 01:07:57,583
..then we'll deal
with your problem first.

1208
01:07:58,625 --> 01:08:00,374
What now?
Pack your bags.

1209
01:08:00,375 --> 01:08:02,999
Let's go to ISBT.
Catch the bus to Punjab.

1210
01:08:04,375 --> 01:08:05,499
Yes.

1211
01:08:08,084 --> 01:08:09,249
Are you crazy?

1212
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:10,749
You think I'm going
to booze during daytime.

1213
01:08:10,750 --> 01:08:12,833
Don't you see I am with a lady?

1214
01:08:12,834 --> 01:08:13,541
Sorry!

1215
01:08:15,292 --> 01:08:17,874
What happened?
Why are you getting so furious?

1216
01:08:18,084 --> 01:08:20,333
You see, Tanu, your doctor husband..

1217
01:08:20,334 --> 01:08:21,874
..is just bad news.

1218
01:08:22,125 --> 01:08:24,208
And he's back in my life.

1219
01:08:24,209 --> 01:08:26,583
And this time...l won't
let him get the best of me.

1220
01:08:27,292 --> 01:08:29,541
l will shoot him.

1221
01:08:29,542 --> 01:08:32,166
Why are you abusing him?
Tell me what happened.

1222
01:08:32,625 --> 01:08:34,208
Four years..

1223
01:08:34,917 --> 01:08:37,083
lt took me four years
to find this girl.

1224
01:08:37,084 --> 01:08:40,041
l didn't talk or meet her,
just said yes to marrying her.

1225
01:08:40,042 --> 01:08:40,916
Why?

1226
01:08:42,625 --> 01:08:43,749
Because...

1227
01:08:45,084 --> 01:08:46,083
She looked like you.

1228
01:08:46,084 --> 01:08:48,124
l thought if not you,
then maybe someone like you.

1229
01:08:48,125 --> 01:08:50,458
But your husband can't
endure that either.

1230
01:08:51,709 --> 01:08:54,499
He wants the original
as well as the duplicate.

1231
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:56,624
What are you saying?
l don't understand.

1232
01:08:56,875 --> 01:08:57,999
What do you mean?

1233
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:01,708
I mean he's been getting
cozy with my fiancée, in Delhi.

1234
01:09:01,875 --> 01:09:02,791
Who?

1235
01:09:03,750 --> 01:09:04,916
Manu?
- Yes.

1236
01:09:05,125 --> 01:09:06,916
Who told you?
- My sister.

1237
01:09:06,917 --> 01:09:09,374
But you don't have a sister.
- She's a distant cousin. You don't know her.

1238
01:09:09,375 --> 01:09:11,124
Where does she live?
- Delhi.

1239
01:09:11,125 --> 01:09:12,374
Where in Delhi?

1240
01:09:12,834 --> 01:09:13,499
Uttam Vihar.

1241
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:15,083
But Manu lives in Mayur Vihar.

1242
01:09:15,084 --> 01:09:16,708
Maybe they met someplace else,
I don't know.

1243
01:09:16,709 --> 01:09:18,124
He's in love with your sister.

1244
01:09:18,125 --> 01:09:19,874
Not my sister, her sister-in-law.

1245
01:09:20,084 --> 01:09:22,041
But you said he's been
going around with your sister.

1246
01:09:22,042 --> 01:09:23,708
Hey Tanuja Trivedi.

1247
01:09:23,709 --> 01:09:25,083
Are you a RAW agent?

1248
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:27,208
Just try to understand
what l am saying.

1249
01:09:27,209 --> 01:09:29,208
Your husband's in love again.

1250
01:09:29,667 --> 01:09:30,833
He's betrayed you.

1251
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,916
He's given you the finger,
and getting married again.

1252
01:09:32,917 --> 01:09:34,624
And all this is ruining my life.

1253
01:09:42,292 --> 01:09:43,791
He cannot show me the finger.

1254
01:09:44,209 --> 01:09:45,374
What could be better than..

1255
01:09:45,375 --> 01:09:47,541
..a man settling
down at the age of 40.

1256
01:09:48,542 --> 01:09:51,041
Shut up!

1257
01:09:51,334 --> 01:09:53,083
Don't you see we're talking here?

1258
01:09:58,709 --> 01:10:00,208
He cannot show me the finger.

1259
01:10:00,542 --> 01:10:01,541
He's a small potato.

1260
01:10:01,750 --> 01:10:04,458
I don't care if he's
a potato or apple.

1261
01:10:04,709 --> 01:10:06,541
Either you return my fiancée..

1262
01:10:06,542 --> 01:10:08,374
..or you come back in my life.

1263
01:10:08,792 --> 01:10:10,749
l am a simple contractor.

1264
01:10:11,167 --> 01:10:12,583
l don't have much brain.

1265
01:10:12,584 --> 01:10:15,791
But I do know one needs
cement to join bricks.

1266
01:10:15,792 --> 01:10:19,583
l don't care if its
JK cement orAmbuja cement.

1267
01:10:20,709 --> 01:10:22,749
But this should happen at all cost,
that's all.

1268
01:10:35,709 --> 01:10:37,499
Mister, will you take us to Sector 16?

1269
01:10:48,417 --> 01:10:49,249
Here.

1270
01:10:49,959 --> 01:10:51,874
Manu's gone, daughter-in-law.

1271
01:10:51,875 --> 01:10:53,166
What do you want now?

1272
01:10:53,584 --> 01:10:54,916
Didn't you feel ashamed..

1273
01:10:54,917 --> 01:10:56,291
..when you sent him
to the mental asylum?

1274
01:10:56,292 --> 01:10:57,749
l don't need him.

1275
01:10:57,750 --> 01:11:00,458
ln fact he needs my permission.
l am still his legal wife.

1276
01:11:00,459 --> 01:11:03,541
l can make all of you rot in jail.

1277
01:11:03,542 --> 01:11:05,208
That's all there's left for you to do.

1278
01:11:05,459 --> 01:11:07,624
You have done everything else.

1279
01:11:18,542 --> 01:11:20,624
So this is where Jassi lives now?
- Yes.

1280
01:11:20,625 --> 01:11:22,499
Stay back.

1281
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:23,416
Why?

1282
01:11:23,667 --> 01:11:25,458
No need to hide, let's go inside.

1283
01:11:25,667 --> 01:11:28,916
We're not here on a holiday.

1284
01:11:28,917 --> 01:11:30,583
We're here to elope with the girl.

1285
01:11:31,167 --> 01:11:33,166
Komal is Jassi's cousin.

1286
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:35,291
lf these Sardar's find out..

1287
01:11:35,292 --> 01:11:37,041
..they will abuse me to death.

1288
01:11:37,042 --> 01:11:38,791
You.. why you..

1289
01:11:38,792 --> 01:11:39,833
What rubbish.

1290
01:11:40,084 --> 01:11:43,208
Jassi's my friend.
l'll talk to him. - Don't...No.

1291
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:44,541
Now it's too late.

1292
01:11:44,917 --> 01:11:46,999
You already missed the deadline.

1293
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:48,999
Datto.

1294
01:11:49,250 --> 01:11:50,874
lf you're caught
eloping with the girl..

1295
01:11:51,084 --> 01:11:52,791
..they will beat you up terribly.

1296
01:11:54,250 --> 01:11:55,874
Strangely I have faith in you.

1297
01:11:56,125 --> 01:11:57,416
You can do this.

1298
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,708
You must tell her once..

1299
01:11:59,709 --> 01:12:01,958
..that Pappi's here for you.
- Right.

1300
01:12:02,125 --> 01:12:04,333
WeIl then...do you have a
picture of her on your mobile?

1301
01:12:04,334 --> 01:12:05,166
l do.

1302
01:12:05,167 --> 01:12:06,583
You see, everyone knows us.

1303
01:12:06,584 --> 01:12:07,958
lf we go inside,
they will never leave us alone.

1304
01:12:07,959 --> 01:12:10,333
You go inside and tell her..
- l get it.

1305
01:12:10,334 --> 01:12:11,958
Komal...your Pappi's here.

1306
01:12:12,125 --> 01:12:13,458
No need to worry.

1307
01:12:13,459 --> 01:12:16,583
He'll jump over this wall
of wealth and take you away.

1308
01:12:16,875 --> 01:12:18,833
See... See that.

1309
01:12:18,834 --> 01:12:20,333
That's a city girl.

1310
01:12:20,584 --> 01:12:22,583
But they will recognize her too.

1311
01:12:22,792 --> 01:12:23,999
She's Tanu, right.

1312
01:12:26,042 --> 01:12:28,541
She's Datto.

1313
01:12:29,292 --> 01:12:31,541
Yes, but they will think she's Tanu.

1314
01:12:32,334 --> 01:12:36,749
She is Datto,
so everyone will think she's Datto.

1315
01:12:38,250 --> 01:12:39,458
Tanu..

1316
01:12:40,917 --> 01:12:46,666
Ohhh...they will think she's Tanu.

1317
01:12:56,250 --> 01:12:57,958
Datto...

1318
01:12:58,125 --> 01:13:11,749
Please wear the Turban.

1319
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:19,041
Datto... walk carefully.

1320
01:13:26,709 --> 01:13:34,416
Sister, have you
seen this girl around?

1321
01:13:37,375 --> 01:13:40,999
Tanu!

1322
01:13:47,750 --> 01:13:48,916
Manu.

1323
01:13:49,125 --> 01:13:52,041
Jassi. - Mannu, my buddy.
What are you doing here?

1324
01:13:53,042 --> 01:13:55,416
How are you?

1325
01:13:55,584 --> 01:13:58,249
Everyone has changed in 4 years.

1326
01:13:58,250 --> 01:14:00,666
You guys were crazy back then,
and you still are.

1327
01:14:01,125 --> 01:14:02,958
Why are you doing this?

1328
01:14:16,917 --> 01:14:19,333
What...what are you doing?

1329
01:14:19,584 --> 01:14:20,583
Sister-in-law Tanu.

1330
01:14:20,834 --> 01:14:22,208
Aren't you ashamed?

1331
01:14:23,542 --> 01:14:24,541
Why would l be ashamed?

1332
01:14:24,542 --> 01:14:26,999
Pappi is going crazy for you.

1333
01:14:27,334 --> 01:14:28,708
And you want to know
why you should be ashamed.

1334
01:14:28,875 --> 01:14:31,083
Pappi's here too.
- He's here for you.

1335
01:14:31,334 --> 01:14:32,291
Pack your bags.

1336
01:14:32,292 --> 01:14:34,708
He's waiting outside by the rickshaw.
Hurry up.

1337
01:14:36,292 --> 01:14:37,208
For me?

1338
01:14:43,084 --> 01:14:44,874
Tanu.
Hello.

1339
01:14:55,209 --> 01:14:55,958
Hi.

1340
01:14:59,792 --> 01:15:03,249
This frock doesn't match
with your turban and beard.

1341
01:15:03,250 --> 01:15:04,416
lt's all okay.

1342
01:15:04,417 --> 01:15:06,624
Komal's would-be
husband is from Gujarat.

1343
01:15:06,625 --> 01:15:08,166
Get it.
That's why..

1344
01:15:08,167 --> 01:15:11,249
So you're going to do the 'Dandiya'.
- Of course.

1345
01:15:11,542 --> 01:15:12,791
We'll do the 'Dandiya'.

1346
01:15:12,792 --> 01:15:14,874
And not just me, you will too.

1347
01:15:14,875 --> 01:15:15,958
Not me. Come on.
- No, not me.

1348
01:15:15,959 --> 01:15:16,749
Oh, come on.

1349
01:15:16,750 --> 01:15:19,916
l don't want to.
- Oh, Come on. - Jassi, listen to me.

1350
01:15:19,917 --> 01:15:21,333
Hold on.
- Hello.

1351
01:15:21,334 --> 01:15:22,374
Hand me the mic.

1352
01:15:22,792 --> 01:15:25,291
Listen up everyone.

1353
01:15:25,792 --> 01:15:28,624
My best friend Manu..

1354
01:15:28,834 --> 01:15:31,499
..has returned from
London's mental asylum.

1355
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:33,041
And l am really happy.

1356
01:15:33,042 --> 01:15:34,124
Very happy.

1357
01:15:34,125 --> 01:15:38,458
l've a humble request, please dance.

1358
01:15:38,917 --> 01:15:41,666
And l swear, those who don't dance..

1359
01:15:41,667 --> 01:15:44,458
..tomorrow morning
your mother will die.

1360
01:15:46,834 --> 01:15:47,958
Come on.

1361
01:15:48,709 --> 01:15:50,041
There's nothing I want to tell you.

1362
01:15:50,292 --> 01:15:52,041
l don't love you.

1363
01:15:52,042 --> 01:15:54,041
How long are you going
to lie to yourself?

1364
01:15:54,042 --> 01:15:55,291
That's the limit.

1365
01:15:55,667 --> 01:15:57,166
l am not lying to you.

1366
01:15:57,375 --> 01:15:59,416
You're just a good friend, Pappi.

1367
01:15:59,417 --> 01:16:01,624
You know..
Just like whatsapp friend.

1368
01:16:01,625 --> 01:16:03,124
Whatsapp friend?

1369
01:16:03,667 --> 01:16:05,833
Then what was all that LOLs for?

1370
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,791
LOL at 3 am...

1371
01:16:07,792 --> 01:16:09,916
Those big LOLs for every small jokes.

1372
01:16:09,917 --> 01:16:11,541
What was all that?

1373
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,791
Listen...l took that overcrowded..

1374
01:16:13,792 --> 01:16:14,833
..Punjab Roadway's bus to get here.

1375
01:16:15,084 --> 01:16:17,208
And you're refusing me.

1376
01:16:17,209 --> 01:16:18,333
You...

1377
01:16:18,625 --> 01:16:20,374
You've lost your mind.

1378
01:16:21,542 --> 01:16:22,624
Listen.

1379
01:16:22,625 --> 01:16:25,041
Tanu, l couIdn't conceive.

1380
01:16:26,125 --> 01:16:27,541
My family was bothering me.

1381
01:16:27,542 --> 01:16:28,874
Why aren't you getting pregnant?
When will you bear a child?

1382
01:16:28,875 --> 01:16:29,999
When? How?

1383
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,124
They really got on my nerves.

1384
01:16:31,125 --> 01:16:33,541
We met all the doctors,
got all the tests done.

1385
01:16:33,542 --> 01:16:34,916
And then l found out..

1386
01:16:34,917 --> 01:16:37,124
..that Jassi was the one.

1387
01:16:37,125 --> 01:16:39,083
See...Jassi was infertile.

1388
01:16:39,084 --> 01:16:40,874
Be a man. Be a man.
- Listen to me.

1389
01:16:40,875 --> 01:16:41,791
Drink it.
- Come on.

1390
01:16:41,792 --> 01:16:45,541
It's important.
- Drink it. What are you doing?

1391
01:16:54,292 --> 01:16:55,624
That was neat.

1392
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:01,666
Jassi...listen.

1393
01:17:01,959 --> 01:17:05,041
Jassi, l am getting married again.

1394
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:11,083
You manned up in a single drink.
- Yes.

1395
01:17:11,334 --> 01:17:14,333
You cannot betray me.
- What betrayal?

1396
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:17,249
Did I ever say that l love you?
Never!

1397
01:17:17,250 --> 01:17:19,999
That's only because you're shy.
- Shy my foot.

1398
01:17:20,542 --> 01:17:21,999
l don't love you.

1399
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,958
And anyway,
the wedding's day after tomorrow..

1400
01:17:23,959 --> 01:17:24,874
..and I am really happy.

1401
01:17:24,875 --> 01:17:27,624
You'll have to get married
over my dead body, believe me!

1402
01:17:27,625 --> 01:17:30,791
Fine with me, just stop following me.

1403
01:17:31,084 --> 01:17:34,124
Such arrogance!
Such arrogance!

1404
01:17:34,959 --> 01:17:38,416
I wouldn't have given you
a second Iook if l was any younger.

1405
01:17:38,417 --> 01:17:41,249
Two really hip girls from
my neighborhood proposed to me..

1406
01:17:41,250 --> 01:17:43,249
..but I refused them only for you.

1407
01:17:43,584 --> 01:17:45,499
Understand.
Listen..

1408
01:17:45,750 --> 01:17:47,166
lf you don't love me yet,
then do it now.

1409
01:17:47,709 --> 01:17:49,208
Have you lost your mind?

1410
01:17:49,500 --> 01:17:50,708
Do you have any idea..

1411
01:17:50,709 --> 01:17:53,416
..how much property
my husband has in Surat?

1412
01:17:53,625 --> 01:17:57,124
Even I've booked
a shop in Greater Noida.

1413
01:17:57,917 --> 01:17:59,791
l have a receipt.

1414
01:18:00,125 --> 01:18:02,749
So Jassi ruined all
my plans of family planning.

1415
01:18:02,959 --> 01:18:04,374
Then I talked to Sukanya.

1416
01:18:04,584 --> 01:18:06,249
What's wrong?

1417
01:18:06,709 --> 01:18:08,499
What?
- l need to go to the bathroom.

1418
01:18:08,667 --> 01:18:11,708
Fine, we're talking after a long time.

1419
01:18:11,709 --> 01:18:12,624
Sit down.

1420
01:18:12,625 --> 01:18:15,124
Do you know where l met Sukanya?

1421
01:18:15,792 --> 01:18:18,333
She said if your husband
cannot give you a child..

1422
01:18:18,334 --> 01:18:21,083
..then try artificial insemination.

1423
01:18:21,709 --> 01:18:23,583
So that child is artificial.

1424
01:18:24,084 --> 01:18:25,666
Have you lost your
mind after going to London?

1425
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:27,333
The child isn't artificial.

1426
01:18:27,334 --> 01:18:29,124
l mean...it's science.

1427
01:18:29,125 --> 01:18:31,416
lt's done with injection...
and costs millions.

1428
01:18:31,417 --> 01:18:33,874
lt's like...test tube baby.

1429
01:18:33,875 --> 01:18:35,416
And so costly..

1430
01:18:35,417 --> 01:18:37,541
How much does kid this size cost?

1431
01:18:39,875 --> 01:18:42,208
The child grows in your fetus,
not the thermos.

1432
01:18:42,209 --> 01:18:43,166
Have you lost your mind?

1433
01:18:43,459 --> 01:18:46,083
Am l drunk or are you?

1434
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:48,791
This new haircut suits you.

1435
01:18:50,334 --> 01:18:52,749
Why are you buying the
same color Mercedes again?

1436
01:18:53,625 --> 01:18:54,874
Why don't you change color?

1437
01:18:55,084 --> 01:18:56,166
What do you mean?

1438
01:18:56,167 --> 01:18:57,999
This one's like Tanu too.

1439
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,708
You could've tried something else.

1440
01:18:59,709 --> 01:19:03,874
Like Aishwarya...Deepika...Katrina.

1441
01:19:04,125 --> 01:19:06,583
There are many new
ones in the market now.

1442
01:19:06,584 --> 01:19:08,083
But you're doing great.

1443
01:19:08,084 --> 01:19:11,083
My life is ruined.

1444
01:19:11,417 --> 01:19:12,916
Pappi!

1445
01:19:13,584 --> 01:19:14,624
Come in.

1446
01:19:14,834 --> 01:19:17,374
Pappi.
- Jassi.

1447
01:19:17,667 --> 01:19:21,958
Pappi, how are you?
- Great.

1448
01:19:21,959 --> 01:19:25,541
Have a drink?
Where were you?

1449
01:19:25,542 --> 01:19:27,166
Some cripple was bothering me.

1450
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:30,958
Manu, there is some
cripple in the party.

1451
01:19:30,959 --> 01:19:33,416
Where is he?

1452
01:19:33,834 --> 01:19:35,499
Who?
- Pappi.

1453
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,249
Pappi was never here, Jassi.

1454
01:19:40,167 --> 01:19:42,458
He was just saying..

1455
01:19:42,459 --> 01:19:44,541
Jassi, l think you're drunk.

1456
01:19:44,917 --> 01:19:46,708
Pappi isn't here.
Listen to me.

1457
01:19:47,250 --> 01:19:48,708
Get some rest.

1458
01:19:48,709 --> 01:19:51,374
Here. Drink it.

1459
01:19:51,375 --> 01:19:54,458
Are you there, Manu?
- Come on. Drink it.

1460
01:19:54,709 --> 01:19:56,249
No one knows that
this child isn't Jassi's.

1461
01:19:56,250 --> 01:19:59,041
They never leave her alone. Right?

1462
01:19:59,042 --> 01:20:00,458
No one leaves her alone..

1463
01:20:00,459 --> 01:20:02,374
They're always carrying
her in their arms.

1464
01:20:02,375 --> 01:20:03,583
Tanu..

1465
01:20:04,209 --> 01:20:05,333
l have to go to the bathroom.

1466
01:20:05,334 --> 01:20:06,583
The bathroom's this way.

1467
01:20:06,584 --> 01:20:08,249
Tanu, l feel really guilty.

1468
01:20:08,250 --> 01:20:09,416
What do l do? Should l tell them?

1469
01:20:09,417 --> 01:20:11,583
But if I tell him,
it will hurt his manhood.

1470
01:20:11,584 --> 01:20:12,708
They're such ignorant people..

1471
01:20:12,709 --> 01:20:14,458
..they measure their manhood
with their sperm count.

1472
01:20:14,459 --> 01:20:15,541
Look there..

1473
01:20:17,417 --> 01:20:18,208
Oh...

1474
01:20:18,417 --> 01:20:20,708
How did you do that?
Did you hit her here? Karate.

1475
01:20:20,709 --> 01:20:23,291
What else could l do?
She wasn't letting me leave.

1476
01:20:23,292 --> 01:20:25,041
I see. - Did she finish
packing her bags? Shall we go?

1477
01:20:25,042 --> 01:20:28,124
She says she doesn't love me.

1478
01:20:28,125 --> 01:20:29,416
Doesn't love you?

1479
01:20:30,167 --> 01:20:31,749
So...were you mistaken..

1480
01:20:31,750 --> 01:20:33,583
..or is she going back on her words.

1481
01:20:34,250 --> 01:20:36,458
She's the one who's denying it.
She still does.

1482
01:20:36,667 --> 01:20:38,249
Then let's get out of here.

1483
01:20:38,250 --> 01:20:40,666
l think she'll say
yes if you talk to her.

1484
01:20:40,875 --> 01:20:41,916
What do l say to her?

1485
01:20:42,209 --> 01:20:44,208
If she isn't listening
to you why will she listen to me?

1486
01:20:44,417 --> 01:20:47,624
No, no, l think she'll
say yes if you talk to her.

1487
01:20:48,417 --> 01:20:50,833
l should try talking to her once.
- Yes.

1488
01:20:51,459 --> 01:20:53,583
This side.

1489
01:20:54,209 --> 01:20:58,333
You fools, Shahrukh Khan's outside.

1490
01:21:02,417 --> 01:21:03,208
Come on.

1491
01:21:04,667 --> 01:21:05,666
What are you doing?

1492
01:21:05,834 --> 01:21:07,749
That's what I want to ask you...

1493
01:21:08,625 --> 01:21:10,874
Listen, listen...
- Now, what are you doing?

1494
01:21:11,167 --> 01:21:12,833
Look, I'll scream.

1495
01:21:12,834 --> 01:21:15,208
Your family's already
making quite a racket.

1496
01:21:15,209 --> 01:21:17,749
Who's going to hear you?
Listen to me.

1497
01:21:18,084 --> 01:21:20,166
What's your problem
with this good man?

1498
01:21:20,417 --> 01:21:22,541
What's so special about
that boy from Surat?

1499
01:21:22,542 --> 01:21:26,624
Money.
Even Pappi can earn a square meal.

1500
01:21:26,959 --> 01:21:30,083
He loves you.
He came this far for you.

1501
01:21:30,292 --> 01:21:31,541
And you don't care.

1502
01:21:31,542 --> 01:21:32,666
Shut up!

1503
01:21:33,459 --> 01:21:35,624
Fools. Run away.

1504
01:21:35,917 --> 01:21:37,749
She isn't listening.

1505
01:21:37,750 --> 01:21:39,458
Shall l show her too?

1506
01:21:39,834 --> 01:21:41,166
Look..

1507
01:21:46,750 --> 01:21:49,916
What's wrong with her?
- She's drunk.

1508
01:21:49,917 --> 01:21:51,041
Drunk?

1509
01:21:53,375 --> 01:21:54,416
Payal.

1510
01:21:54,959 --> 01:21:58,083
There was no Shahrukh Khan.

1511
01:21:58,459 --> 01:22:01,041
She tricked us..
- She fooled us.

1512
01:22:01,792 --> 01:22:03,999
What happened?
Payal? Payal?

1513
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:05,291
Payal?

1514
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:10,208
That's him. Yes, him.
This guy was sitting there.

1515
01:22:10,209 --> 01:22:11,958
Catch him. Don't let him go!

1516
01:22:12,375 --> 01:22:13,374
Pappi..

1517
01:22:21,875 --> 01:22:23,749
She has put on a lot of weight.

1518
01:22:23,750 --> 01:22:25,791
You take so long.

1519
01:22:25,792 --> 01:22:28,249
Right, as if you were
missing your flight.

1520
01:22:29,209 --> 01:22:31,874
Mr. Sharma!
- Mr. Sharma!

1521
01:22:36,959 --> 01:22:40,041
Let's go. Let's go.

1522
01:22:41,459 --> 01:22:42,999
Run.

1523
01:22:44,584 --> 01:22:46,041
Come on, shift to second gear.

1524
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:47,416
Second.

1525
01:22:51,250 --> 01:22:52,291
Stupid.

1526
01:23:11,042 --> 01:23:12,541
Thank you.

1527
01:23:22,417 --> 01:23:24,916
You know, Dhatto Manju
is getting married today.

1528
01:23:24,917 --> 01:23:26,791
Manju, you're getting married today.

1529
01:23:26,792 --> 01:23:27,749
Yes.

1530
01:23:29,042 --> 01:23:30,749
Brother, keep sister-in-law there.

1531
01:23:30,750 --> 01:23:31,999
Dhatto is back.

1532
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:33,791
Greetings, grandma.
- Greetings.

1533
01:23:33,792 --> 01:23:35,041
Where's everyone?

1534
01:23:35,042 --> 01:23:37,749
They're all at Manju's place. Today
is the musical ceremony at her place.

1535
01:23:39,834 --> 01:23:41,208
Give that to me, Mr. Sharma?

1536
01:23:44,209 --> 01:23:46,541
Whose dead body is that?
- Which one?

1537
01:23:46,542 --> 01:23:47,624
This one.

1538
01:23:47,625 --> 01:23:50,708
Mr. Sharma, what will my brother..

1539
01:23:50,709 --> 01:23:52,791
..caIl your brother's wife?

1540
01:23:54,375 --> 01:23:57,208
What will he call her, Pappi?
-Aunty.

1541
01:23:57,459 --> 01:23:58,624
She's your aunty.

1542
01:23:58,625 --> 01:23:59,833
And who's this man?

1543
01:23:59,834 --> 01:24:01,583
Will you tell anyone?
- No, l won't.

1544
01:24:01,584 --> 01:24:05,208
No, you will tell everyone.
- l will not. Give me 100 rupees.

1545
01:24:07,292 --> 01:24:08,958
He's your brother-in-law.

1546
01:24:14,667 --> 01:24:17,541
l got 100 rupees.
l got 100 rupees.

1547
01:24:20,959 --> 01:24:24,624
Dhatto's brought brother-in-law home.

1548
01:24:25,125 --> 01:24:26,583
Come here.

1549
01:24:27,625 --> 01:24:29,249
Sir, we did the best we could.

1550
01:24:29,250 --> 01:24:30,916
Call the Commissioner first.

1551
01:24:30,917 --> 01:24:34,333
Why do you drink so
much if you can't digest it?

1552
01:24:41,167 --> 01:24:42,083
Tanu?

1553
01:24:44,125 --> 01:24:45,833
Weren't you ashamed?
- Look, mister..

1554
01:24:46,209 --> 01:24:48,749
Take him away! You brought
these idiots back home with you.

1555
01:24:48,750 --> 01:24:50,541
You went out to be famous.

1556
01:24:50,709 --> 01:24:52,166
Now l'll show you.
- Show me what.

1557
01:24:52,167 --> 01:24:54,458
l am not your wife.
l am a state level athlete.

1558
01:24:54,709 --> 01:24:57,124
I'll show you instead.
l'll have you arrested.

1559
01:24:57,584 --> 01:25:02,708
These idiots have
polluted your mind..

1560
01:25:03,167 --> 01:25:04,333
Leave my hand, Dhatto.

1561
01:25:04,667 --> 01:25:06,541
Don't humiliate your family.

1562
01:25:06,542 --> 01:25:08,416
l'm not even scared of my father.

1563
01:25:08,417 --> 01:25:12,833
Hey take her away! - "I'm in love."

1564
01:25:13,750 --> 01:25:18,583
"In love with you again."

1565
01:25:19,625 --> 01:25:24,499
"Tell me what to do."

1566
01:25:24,500 --> 01:25:29,916
"What to do?"

1567
01:25:30,292 --> 01:25:35,749
"l'm in love."

1568
01:25:35,750 --> 01:25:40,999
"In love with you again."

1569
01:25:41,375 --> 01:25:46,791
"Tell me what to do."

1570
01:25:46,792 --> 01:25:52,166
"What to do?"

1571
01:25:52,167 --> 01:25:54,291
They're trying to burn us?
- What?

1572
01:25:54,292 --> 01:25:55,208
Set us on fire.

1573
01:25:55,209 --> 01:25:56,749
Mister..

1574
01:25:57,250 --> 01:25:59,083
Listen, mister.
- PT Usha...now l'll show you.

1575
01:25:59,084 --> 01:26:00,499
Listen..

1576
01:26:00,500 --> 01:26:01,958
You cannot take the law in your hands.

1577
01:26:01,959 --> 01:26:03,666
What are you doing?
- Hand us over to the police.

1578
01:26:03,667 --> 01:26:04,833
Get lost.. go get the matches.

1579
01:26:04,834 --> 01:26:06,666
Matches...for what?

1580
01:26:07,792 --> 01:26:09,874
But he did come here, didn't he?
- Yes..

1581
01:26:09,875 --> 01:26:12,874
You were saying that..

1582
01:26:13,334 --> 01:26:15,208
Stop this nonsense.

1583
01:26:15,917 --> 01:26:17,124
And try to understand
what l am saying.

1584
01:26:17,334 --> 01:26:18,624
Let's get to Kusum's
village immediateIy..

1585
01:26:18,625 --> 01:26:20,124
..or else we'll reach
only after the wedding.

1586
01:26:20,125 --> 01:26:22,458
Village? You said she lived in Delhi.

1587
01:26:22,667 --> 01:26:24,666
Her brother lives in Delhi.

1588
01:26:24,667 --> 01:26:26,958
Her entire family lives
in the Jhajjar district.

1589
01:26:27,584 --> 01:26:29,583
Tanu, life has already
served me many blows..

1590
01:26:29,584 --> 01:26:30,666
..don't humiliate me anymore.

1591
01:26:30,667 --> 01:26:32,041
Sir...get the car.

1592
01:26:32,042 --> 01:26:34,624
Your friend has nipped you badly.

1593
01:26:35,459 --> 01:26:36,999
Get the Pajero!

1594
01:26:43,042 --> 01:26:44,208
Brother, give me your matches.

1595
01:26:44,209 --> 01:26:46,666
How are you?
- Give me the matches.

1596
01:26:46,667 --> 01:26:48,124
What will you do with them?

1597
01:26:48,542 --> 01:26:50,458
We need to burn two people.

1598
01:26:52,625 --> 01:26:53,499
Move aside.

1599
01:26:53,500 --> 01:26:55,083
Here. Burn them.
- Burn them.

1600
01:26:55,292 --> 01:26:56,874
Hey..
- Wait. Let him burn them.

1601
01:26:56,875 --> 01:26:59,958
Give it here.
Shut up! Shut up!

1602
01:27:01,125 --> 01:27:03,124
What's going on here?

1603
01:27:03,750 --> 01:27:05,499
Have you all lost your mind?

1604
01:27:14,500 --> 01:27:15,208
What?

1605
01:27:16,625 --> 01:27:17,541
Nothing.

1606
01:27:18,292 --> 01:27:20,499
You could've changed first.

1607
01:27:22,417 --> 01:27:25,041
For 18 years,
we've been fighting over this.

1608
01:27:25,709 --> 01:27:27,249
This is exactly why l left home.

1609
01:27:27,750 --> 01:27:28,708
l quit wrestling.

1610
01:27:28,959 --> 01:27:30,916
l will get a small job,
live in a small home..

1611
01:27:31,084 --> 01:27:34,249
..but stay away from
ignorant' like you.

1612
01:27:34,584 --> 01:27:36,374
And keep my sister away too.

1613
01:27:37,417 --> 01:27:39,874
The girls world-over
are making progress.

1614
01:27:40,250 --> 01:27:43,374
But you...keep your daughters
tied to your courtyards.

1615
01:27:43,625 --> 01:27:44,958
Don't let them make any progress.

1616
01:27:45,375 --> 01:27:47,749
Either you kill them
before they are born.

1617
01:27:48,084 --> 01:27:50,958
And if she grows up,
then strangle her to death.

1618
01:27:51,834 --> 01:27:53,666
Weren't you ashamed of assaulting..

1619
01:27:53,667 --> 01:27:55,958
..a girl that carved
a niche for herself.

1620
01:27:55,959 --> 01:27:57,999
Speak up.
Why don't you speak?

1621
01:27:58,000 --> 01:27:59,958
You think beating these
girls make you a man.

1622
01:28:00,209 --> 01:28:01,708
She could've eloped and got married.

1623
01:28:02,125 --> 01:28:03,083
But her mistake was..

1624
01:28:03,250 --> 01:28:05,499
..she came to get permission
from idiots like you.

1625
01:28:05,500 --> 01:28:07,291
Omi, we aren't against it.

1626
01:28:07,292 --> 01:28:09,041
But there's something as community.

1627
01:28:09,042 --> 01:28:09,916
Right.

1628
01:28:10,334 --> 01:28:12,999
You all belong to the royal
families of Rajasthan, don't you?

1629
01:28:13,167 --> 01:28:15,499
Which is why you're so
concerned about your community.

1630
01:28:15,875 --> 01:28:18,624
And uncle,
do you belong to the dinosaur family?

1631
01:28:18,917 --> 01:28:20,416
And if your daughter
married someone else..

1632
01:28:20,750 --> 01:28:21,874
..we'll all go extinct.

1633
01:28:21,875 --> 01:28:25,624
Look, he's absolutely right.
ln fact, l would say.. - Be quiet.

1634
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:27,583
The can of kerosene
is still besides us.

1635
01:28:27,584 --> 01:28:29,708
He's doing good, let him.

1636
01:28:30,209 --> 01:28:31,416
Brother Omi, please send Dhatto.

1637
01:28:31,417 --> 01:28:34,416
l applied henna on one hand
now l need to get my other hand done.

1638
01:28:36,459 --> 01:28:38,083
Go, dear. She's upstairs.

1639
01:28:38,584 --> 01:28:39,249
Take her along.

1640
01:28:40,042 --> 01:28:43,916
Everyone listen carefully.

1641
01:28:44,125 --> 01:28:45,083
She's my sister.

1642
01:28:45,334 --> 01:28:47,291
She can marry anyone she wants.

1643
01:28:47,500 --> 01:28:48,916
Just try and stop her.

1644
01:28:49,167 --> 01:28:51,624
And l'll show you what brains are for.

1645
01:29:14,042 --> 01:29:16,583
"Like a hot-air balloon
she's rising up."

1646
01:29:16,584 --> 01:29:18,541
"No one can lay a hand on her."

1647
01:29:18,542 --> 01:29:21,291
"The girl's shining like thunder."

1648
01:29:22,834 --> 01:29:27,541
"Issued in the interest
of public interest."

1649
01:29:27,542 --> 01:29:30,416
"Now you handle this responsibility."

1650
01:29:31,750 --> 01:29:36,249
"She keeps chatting...waves
her hands around."

1651
01:29:36,500 --> 01:29:40,208
"Never takes a backseat."

1652
01:29:40,417 --> 01:29:44,874
"Sweetheart...your
swagger looks beautiful."

1653
01:29:45,084 --> 01:29:48,874
"Sweetheart...your swagger.."

1654
01:29:49,209 --> 01:30:02,541
"Sweetheart...your
swagger looks beautiful."

1655
01:30:02,750 --> 01:30:05,916
"Sweetheart...your swagger.."

1656
01:30:16,417 --> 01:30:20,541
"You're pure gold,
neither silver nor copper."

1657
01:30:20,875 --> 01:30:25,083
"Every subject she
touches...she's a topper."

1658
01:30:29,584 --> 01:30:34,166
"She flies away with
her own wings proper."

1659
01:30:34,167 --> 01:30:38,333
"Even bhangda feels proud
if you accept its offer."

1660
01:30:38,584 --> 01:30:40,666
"Never listens...always stubborn."

1661
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,083
"And the sharp wit."

1662
01:30:43,084 --> 01:30:45,791
"She's a double-edged sword."

1663
01:30:47,334 --> 01:30:49,791
"Don't know if she's coming or going."

1664
01:30:49,792 --> 01:30:51,999
"She's running around in the lane."

1665
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,374
"Better be prepared."

1666
01:30:56,334 --> 01:30:58,499
"She jumps around."

1667
01:30:58,500 --> 01:31:00,624
"She leaps and pounces."

1668
01:31:00,959 --> 01:31:04,624
"She never looks relaxing."

1669
01:31:04,834 --> 01:31:09,208
"Sweetheart...your
swagger looks beautiful."

1670
01:31:09,417 --> 01:31:12,958
"Sweetheart...your swagger.."

1671
01:31:12,959 --> 01:31:13,958
"..Beautiful."

1672
01:31:13,959 --> 01:31:18,208
"Sweetheart...your
swagger looks beautiful."

1673
01:31:18,209 --> 01:31:21,499
"Sweetheart...your swagger.."

1674
01:31:53,792 --> 01:31:54,624
Come.

1675
01:31:56,667 --> 01:31:58,833
Listen don't try to stop me today.

1676
01:31:58,834 --> 01:32:01,208
Yeah...yeah....we'll see.

1677
01:32:01,584 --> 01:32:02,958
Look there.

1678
01:32:04,792 --> 01:32:06,291
Hey got it!

1679
01:32:07,292 --> 01:32:11,208
You can't stab me again and marry her.

1680
01:32:12,584 --> 01:32:14,041
What happened, mister?

1681
01:32:21,625 --> 01:32:23,791
Hey...Hanuman.

1682
01:32:25,209 --> 01:32:28,249
Sister-in-law...you?

1683
01:32:28,459 --> 01:32:31,541
Trying to sneak away.
- No, no. I...was..

1684
01:32:31,750 --> 01:32:33,958
Where's your brother?

1685
01:32:33,959 --> 01:32:35,583
Who? Manu?

1686
01:32:35,584 --> 01:32:38,041
l haven't met him for years.
ls he here?

1687
01:32:39,292 --> 01:32:40,666
Where's Komal?
- Komal who?

1688
01:32:40,667 --> 01:32:42,583
Komal.
- Hold on.

1689
01:32:42,584 --> 01:32:44,958
l saw her at the ice-cream counter.

1690
01:32:44,959 --> 01:32:45,749
Komal.

1691
01:32:45,750 --> 01:32:46,499
What?

1692
01:32:46,500 --> 01:32:48,249
Forgive me, brother.

1693
01:32:48,250 --> 01:32:49,208
By the time l got there..

1694
01:32:49,417 --> 01:32:50,999
..they had already kidnapped her.

1695
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:54,041
Sister-in-law, it's all ruined.

1696
01:32:54,209 --> 01:32:55,249
Hold on.

1697
01:32:55,500 --> 01:32:58,208
Komal, look who's here for you.

1698
01:33:04,459 --> 01:33:06,041
O Doctor!

1699
01:33:13,834 --> 01:33:15,124
Wow, Mr. Sharma.

1700
01:33:15,917 --> 01:33:17,791
l turned sordid..

1701
01:33:18,334 --> 01:33:20,374
..but you turned completely shameless.

1702
01:33:21,042 --> 01:33:22,083
Don't worry.

1703
01:33:22,250 --> 01:33:24,374
l only came here to see your bride.

1704
01:33:25,084 --> 01:33:29,166
Who is the one who did
what I couldn't do in four years?

1705
01:34:00,459 --> 01:34:03,624
Awasthi, you said she looks like me.

1706
01:34:06,667 --> 01:34:09,208
Settle for reebook
instead of Reebok, right?

1707
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:17,041
Mr. Sharma,
you found her to replace me?

1708
01:34:17,417 --> 01:34:19,541
This joker. This ignorant.

1709
01:34:21,792 --> 01:34:23,624
You deserve better than this.

1710
01:34:23,625 --> 01:34:25,083
l deserve better than this.

1711
01:34:25,417 --> 01:34:27,916
You should've thought
about my honor at least.

1712
01:34:27,917 --> 01:34:30,083
Hey girl...come to your senses.

1713
01:34:30,459 --> 01:34:31,791
Talk respectfully.

1714
01:34:31,792 --> 01:34:34,583
You're laughing at me.
What about you?

1715
01:34:34,834 --> 01:34:36,249
You couldn't manage your own home.

1716
01:34:36,500 --> 01:34:39,833
Your father raised you first and then,
Mr. Sharma took care of you.

1717
01:34:40,125 --> 01:34:42,291
You never even bought an
underwear with your own money.

1718
01:34:42,292 --> 01:34:43,458
Laughing at me.

1719
01:34:43,709 --> 01:34:45,958
You can see the world,
booze and buy fashionable clothes..

1720
01:34:45,959 --> 01:34:47,083
..with his credit card.

1721
01:34:47,459 --> 01:34:48,624
How can you call me ignorant?

1722
01:34:48,625 --> 01:34:51,833
I got admission in Delhi
University through sports quota.

1723
01:34:51,834 --> 01:34:53,541
l am a state level athlete.

1724
01:34:53,792 --> 01:34:55,458
Calling me ignorant.

1725
01:34:56,959 --> 01:34:59,041
And listen...I am not
over smart like you.

1726
01:34:59,042 --> 01:35:00,958
But I can earn a penny for my family..

1727
01:35:00,959 --> 01:35:02,083
..and also take care of the kids.

1728
01:35:02,084 --> 01:35:03,249
You cannot even earn a penny..

1729
01:35:03,584 --> 01:35:05,499
..and kids are not your cup of tea.

1730
01:35:10,792 --> 01:35:11,916
What are you staring at me for?

1731
01:35:12,125 --> 01:35:13,249
Aren't you going
to say something to her?

1732
01:35:13,250 --> 01:35:14,666
No one's going to say anything.

1733
01:35:15,375 --> 01:35:17,749
One has to maintain
relations to keep them.

1734
01:35:17,750 --> 01:35:18,999
You shut up, you...
- Tanu!

1735
01:35:27,584 --> 01:35:31,166
Omi, fix a date for the marriage.

1736
01:35:36,834 --> 01:35:38,791
Can I garland her?

1737
01:35:39,292 --> 01:35:41,666
Go on. Go on.
Everyone look here.

1738
01:35:42,459 --> 01:35:44,708
Tanu

1739
01:35:44,959 --> 01:35:46,458
Speak in

1740
01:35:47,042 --> 01:35:48,624
Hello...just because
you're in Haryana..

1741
01:35:48,625 --> 01:35:50,416
..you cannot speak in
this new and new feudal terms.

1742
01:35:50,417 --> 01:35:52,083
Okay? She's chosen
to be a woman of leisure.

1743
01:35:52,084 --> 01:35:53,541
What can you say?

1744
01:35:53,542 --> 01:35:55,708
Tell your husband
how you had your kid.

1745
01:35:55,917 --> 01:35:59,416
Madam...
what do you mean by how?

1746
01:36:00,334 --> 01:36:01,749
This is as usual.

1747
01:36:02,417 --> 01:36:04,374
l'll tell you the truth.

1748
01:36:04,667 --> 01:36:05,749
Tell her.

1749
01:36:08,209 --> 01:36:09,624
Speak up.

1750
01:36:10,709 --> 01:36:12,541
ln the hospital, where else?

1751
01:36:15,167 --> 01:36:16,916
What will happen to you now, dear?

1752
01:36:17,625 --> 01:36:21,291
Your loving father even
refuses to see your face now.

1753
01:36:21,584 --> 01:36:23,416
Or your mother's face.

1754
01:36:23,584 --> 01:36:24,666
We're ruined.

1755
01:36:25,042 --> 01:36:26,499
You're ruined too, Tanu.

1756
01:36:26,917 --> 01:36:29,041
That long-fanged witch
devoured your marriage.

1757
01:36:32,584 --> 01:36:34,833
And she ruined my marriage too.

1758
01:36:35,042 --> 01:36:36,041
ldiot.

1759
01:36:36,917 --> 01:36:38,041
She broke my neck.

1760
01:36:38,042 --> 01:36:39,583
Broke our marriages.

1761
01:36:41,375 --> 01:36:42,333
Bad.

1762
01:36:44,834 --> 01:36:46,041
This is it, Tanu.

1763
01:36:46,292 --> 01:36:47,374
Love, affection,
inter-caste marriage...

1764
01:36:47,375 --> 01:36:49,833
Bindi, bangles, the nuptial rounds,
l love you..

1765
01:36:49,834 --> 01:36:52,374
Just one artificial insemination,
and everything's over.

1766
01:36:52,375 --> 01:36:54,791
"What kind of love is this?"

1767
01:36:54,792 --> 01:36:57,541
What was that song we used
to sing when we were in 1st year.

1768
01:36:58,584 --> 01:36:59,666
Have you lost your mind, Tanu?

1769
01:36:59,917 --> 01:37:02,791
You aren't listening
to what I am saying.

1770
01:37:02,792 --> 01:37:06,124
"What is this love...this affection."

1771
01:37:06,125 --> 01:37:07,541
You used to sing that, right?

1772
01:37:10,750 --> 01:37:36,541
"Go away...O Betrayer."

1773
01:37:36,959 --> 01:37:41,708
"What is this love...this affection."

1774
01:37:42,584 --> 01:37:46,749
"You're no one's beloved."

1775
01:37:48,084 --> 01:37:52,916
"All your promises are fake."

1776
01:37:53,959 --> 01:37:58,291
"Go away...O Betrayer."

1777
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:16,333
"l've seen your loyalty."

1778
01:38:16,792 --> 01:38:22,291
"And the unanswered prayers."

1779
01:38:22,584 --> 01:38:28,083
"You didn't think about my heart."

1780
01:38:28,334 --> 01:38:32,541
"l've seen your loyalty."

1781
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:39,374
"And the unanswered prayers."

1782
01:38:39,750 --> 01:38:44,291
"l've seen your loyalty."

1783
01:38:45,209 --> 01:38:50,624
"Go away...O Betrayer."

1784
01:39:02,542 --> 01:39:07,583
"Why shouldn't l sigh with sorrow?"

1785
01:39:08,042 --> 01:39:13,624
"I miss you, what to do."

1786
01:39:13,959 --> 01:39:19,416
"Just tell me oh ignorant."

1787
01:39:19,709 --> 01:39:23,916
"Should l live or
die thinking of you."

1788
01:39:25,250 --> 01:39:30,874
"Just tell me oh ignorant."

1789
01:39:31,125 --> 01:39:35,916
"Should l live or
die thinking of you."

1790
01:39:36,875 --> 01:39:42,041
"Go away...O Betrayer."

1791
01:39:42,500 --> 01:39:47,333
"What is this love...this affection."

1792
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:53,041
"You're no one's beloved."

1793
01:39:53,459 --> 01:39:58,416
"All your promises are fake."

1794
01:39:59,750 --> 01:40:04,833
"Go away...O Betrayer."

1795
01:41:17,334 --> 01:41:18,583
What's all this?

1796
01:41:28,584 --> 01:41:30,208
That Kusum humiliated me..

1797
01:41:31,125 --> 01:41:37,208
..and you just stood there,
and said nothing.

1798
01:41:40,500 --> 01:41:43,208
l was always like that, crazy.

1799
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:46,874
When did you change, Mr. Sharma?

1800
01:41:52,917 --> 01:41:54,708
Don't you miss me?

1801
01:42:03,709 --> 01:42:04,916
l don't.

1802
01:43:44,125 --> 01:43:46,791
Will you come along without
asking any questions?

1803
01:43:50,292 --> 01:43:52,124
lf it's not too urgent,
can l take a bath?

1804
01:44:02,959 --> 01:44:03,958
What is this?

1805
01:44:04,459 --> 01:44:06,083
Divorce papers.

1806
01:44:11,917 --> 01:44:13,166
Congratulations.

1807
01:44:42,709 --> 01:44:46,041
l am very embarrassed for
whatever happened yesterday.

1808
01:44:46,500 --> 01:44:48,791
But Mr. Sharma has
done a lot of favors on me.

1809
01:44:49,459 --> 01:44:52,166
He handled all the
arrangements in my marriage.

1810
01:44:54,167 --> 01:44:56,208
lf l can help out in his marriage..

1811
01:44:56,959 --> 01:44:59,458
..I may be able to
repay a part of my debt.

1812
01:45:01,542 --> 01:45:02,708
Please!

1813
01:45:15,334 --> 01:45:17,124
When is the marriage?
- On the 18th..

1814
01:45:18,500 --> 01:45:20,166
Great, you'll be
out of here in a week.

1815
01:45:33,417 --> 01:45:39,291
"The horizon's empty,
where do l look for you?"

1816
01:45:39,584 --> 01:45:44,833
"Where are you, I can't see
you...listen to my heart calling out."

1817
01:45:44,834 --> 01:45:57,583
"Don't go away...Don't go."

1818
01:45:58,042 --> 01:46:01,166
"I yearn for you,
makes me breathless."

1819
01:46:01,167 --> 01:46:06,458
"My heart's lonely."

1820
01:46:33,917 --> 01:46:46,624
"What bond is this?
l can see it in your eyes."

1821
01:46:47,084 --> 01:46:59,083
"It's getting crushed
between two hearts."

1822
01:46:59,584 --> 01:47:04,708
"Don't ignore your heart."

1823
01:47:04,959 --> 01:47:17,624
"Don't go away...Don't go."

1824
01:47:17,959 --> 01:47:20,999
"I yearn for you,
makes me breathless."

1825
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,916
"My heart's lonely."

1826
01:47:35,584 --> 01:47:38,583
"My heart's full of love."

1827
01:47:38,584 --> 01:47:41,666
"It's a stubborn bird."

1828
01:47:41,667 --> 01:47:44,791
"My heart's full of love."

1829
01:47:44,792 --> 01:47:48,499
"It's a stubborn bird."

1830
01:47:48,792 --> 01:48:00,874
"Expectations have clipped my wings,
but hope keeps me alive."

1831
01:48:01,125 --> 01:48:06,708
"Don't ignore my humble request..
- More water. - Listen.

1832
01:48:08,792 --> 01:48:10,708
What's wrong with you?
Why are you doing this?

1833
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:12,041
l don't know.

1834
01:48:12,750 --> 01:48:13,999
l love you, Mr. Sharma.

1835
01:48:14,459 --> 01:48:16,708
I know you can't
live without me either.

1836
01:48:17,209 --> 01:48:19,041
You think we'll all do as you want.

1837
01:48:19,042 --> 01:48:20,166
And no one will say anything.

1838
01:48:20,167 --> 01:48:22,749
You can say anything you
want but let's go home, please.

1839
01:48:22,750 --> 01:48:24,291
Don't you get it, Tanuja Trivedi.

1840
01:48:24,292 --> 01:48:25,958
Everything is over!
lt's over.

1841
01:48:26,209 --> 01:48:28,666
After a point of time one gives up.
So did mine.

1842
01:48:28,667 --> 01:48:30,916
l can't do anything more than this.
Please, go away.

1843
01:48:32,167 --> 01:48:34,624
l haven't given up yet, Manoj Sharma.

1844
01:48:35,375 --> 01:48:37,749
l will leave only
after l see you married.

1845
01:48:39,167 --> 01:48:39,916
Tanu!

1846
01:48:39,917 --> 01:48:53,291
"Don't go away...Don't go."

1847
01:48:53,292 --> 01:48:56,333
"I yearn for you,
makes me breathless."

1848
01:48:56,334 --> 01:49:00,666
"My heart's lonely."

1849
01:49:16,084 --> 01:49:18,291
l warned you before.

1850
01:49:18,292 --> 01:49:20,083
The cold is getting worse.

1851
01:49:21,084 --> 01:49:23,583
And l also said..

1852
01:49:23,875 --> 01:49:26,791
..that she should take care,
but she didn't listen.

1853
01:49:29,042 --> 01:49:30,958
Now he's caught a cold.

1854
01:49:31,709 --> 01:49:32,666
Kusum.

1855
01:49:35,292 --> 01:49:37,083
Can we talk for a minute, please?

1856
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:42,749
Do you stitch shrouds too?

1857
01:49:42,959 --> 01:49:44,791
What are you saying?

1858
01:49:45,167 --> 01:49:47,541
If you don't,
then get me a readymade one.

1859
01:49:47,792 --> 01:49:49,041
One for you and one for him.

1860
01:49:49,250 --> 01:49:50,624
Shut up, Pappi.

1861
01:49:50,834 --> 01:49:52,499
Bless you, doctor.

1862
01:49:52,792 --> 01:49:54,749
Getting a suit stitched again.

1863
01:49:55,667 --> 01:49:58,291
l haven't had one chance
of getting married..

1864
01:49:58,875 --> 01:50:01,249
..and he's looking
to score once again.

1865
01:50:03,042 --> 01:50:04,291
Are you blind?

1866
01:50:04,292 --> 01:50:05,666
Don't you see your wife?

1867
01:50:05,875 --> 01:50:08,374
Look at her condition.
She's gone crazy?

1868
01:50:08,667 --> 01:50:12,208
ls this why you faced
me so bravely that day?

1869
01:50:12,209 --> 01:50:14,249
You should've let
me marry her instead.

1870
01:50:14,459 --> 01:50:16,499
l loved her,
and l would've handled her too.

1871
01:50:16,500 --> 01:50:18,083
And that girl...Datto.

1872
01:50:18,375 --> 01:50:19,958
She thinks there's nothing wrong..

1873
01:50:19,959 --> 01:50:21,374
..if her face matches with Tanu.

1874
01:50:21,375 --> 01:50:22,749
This is a sin.

1875
01:50:22,750 --> 01:50:24,416
lt's a sin. Big sin.

1876
01:50:24,417 --> 01:50:26,208
He's a sinner.

1877
01:50:26,209 --> 01:50:29,874
He thinks she's naive and innocent.

1878
01:50:30,209 --> 01:50:32,374
And it's the same face he
fell in love with the first time.

1879
01:50:32,375 --> 01:50:33,374
So pounce on it.

1880
01:50:34,084 --> 01:50:35,583
The old one's run her course.

1881
01:50:35,584 --> 01:50:37,791
That's not it.
- That's exactly it.

1882
01:50:37,792 --> 01:50:38,999
That's not it.

1883
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:41,958
l didn't tell her to
send me the divorce letter.

1884
01:50:41,959 --> 01:50:44,583
That was a stupid
fool boy from Rampur..

1885
01:50:44,584 --> 01:50:46,624
..who made all this mess.

1886
01:50:46,625 --> 01:50:47,249
Oh!

1887
01:50:47,792 --> 01:50:49,583
Forgive these two.

1888
01:50:49,834 --> 01:50:51,166
Manu made a mistake.

1889
01:50:51,167 --> 01:50:53,208
And Tanu has never done
anything right in her life.

1890
01:50:53,459 --> 01:50:54,666
They both are big fools.

1891
01:50:54,875 --> 01:50:56,249
But you're the smart one.

1892
01:50:56,250 --> 01:50:58,083
Everyone can see their condition.

1893
01:50:58,084 --> 01:51:01,708
They are so sad. You didn't
notice because you're occupied.

1894
01:51:01,959 --> 01:51:04,666
Husband and wife often quarrel..
- Madam.

1895
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:07,624
They were husband and wife.

1896
01:51:08,625 --> 01:51:10,208
But they aren't any more.

1897
01:51:10,667 --> 01:51:12,291
And what haven't l noticed?

1898
01:51:13,250 --> 01:51:14,666
Are you crazy?

1899
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,416
Didn't you notice the
love between me and Mr. Sharma?

1900
01:51:23,625 --> 01:51:26,874
Raja, I am sorry you
got involved in this again.

1901
01:51:27,625 --> 01:51:31,041
Look, if I knew that Datto...
- Forget that, doctor.

1902
01:51:31,042 --> 01:51:32,583
TeIl me something new.

1903
01:51:32,875 --> 01:51:35,541
I am shocked that I've
been nipped in the bud again.

1904
01:51:36,084 --> 01:51:37,958
Let's be clear about what to do next.

1905
01:51:38,375 --> 01:51:40,958
You tell me what we can do.

1906
01:51:41,750 --> 01:51:43,374
AIl the arrangements are done.

1907
01:51:43,667 --> 01:51:44,624
Nothing can be done now.

1908
01:51:44,625 --> 01:51:46,458
Why not?

1909
01:51:46,959 --> 01:51:49,749
Say no to this marriage
and go back with Tanu.

1910
01:51:50,459 --> 01:51:52,249
And you...get lost.

1911
01:51:53,417 --> 01:51:55,041
Come on, get lost.
No one's getting a suit stitched.

1912
01:51:59,042 --> 01:52:01,708
Look...I don't have
all those qualities.

1913
01:52:02,584 --> 01:52:05,916
Just that I always stick to my word.

1914
01:52:06,125 --> 01:52:08,583
That day it was Tanu,
and now with Datto.

1915
01:52:11,334 --> 01:52:12,249
See..

1916
01:52:12,542 --> 01:52:16,166
If l can't do this, then
l'll be just 80 kilos of dead meat.

1917
01:52:16,167 --> 01:52:16,916
Nothing more.

1918
01:52:16,917 --> 01:52:19,291
What are you saying? What about
the fact that you married Tanu..

1919
01:52:19,292 --> 01:52:20,499
..the same way.

1920
01:52:20,709 --> 01:52:21,708
These days he's following in the..

1921
01:52:21,709 --> 01:52:23,374
..footsteps of Salman
Khan on commitments.

1922
01:52:24,792 --> 01:52:26,333
But everything is not that simple.

1923
01:52:26,334 --> 01:52:27,874
Consider the entire matter first.

1924
01:52:27,875 --> 01:52:30,083
Whatever it was,
but they were married for 4 years,

1925
01:52:30,084 --> 01:52:31,249
There are 2 families involved in this.

1926
01:52:31,250 --> 01:52:33,208
How can Manu just marry someone..
- Look, sister..

1927
01:52:33,209 --> 01:52:34,624
..l am getting married tomorrow.

1928
01:52:35,292 --> 01:52:36,333
l am really busy.

1929
01:52:36,667 --> 01:52:39,333
I know you're feeling
bad about your friend.

1930
01:52:39,334 --> 01:52:41,249
But there's nothing I
or Mr. Sharma can do.

1931
01:52:41,250 --> 01:52:43,583
Mr. Sharma wants..
- Look.

1932
01:52:44,709 --> 01:52:47,708
lf Mr. Sharma tells me that,
l won't marry him.

1933
01:52:47,875 --> 01:52:48,958
Now get out.

1934
01:52:54,042 --> 01:52:55,458
Where are you going?

1935
01:52:55,459 --> 01:52:58,541
Everyone's left this guy behind.

1936
01:52:58,542 --> 01:53:00,583
Left him behind.

1937
01:53:01,500 --> 01:53:05,458
Where's mama?
Where's mama?

1938
01:53:05,959 --> 01:53:08,374
She left you.

1939
01:53:08,792 --> 01:53:10,333
lt was a mistake, Jassi.

1940
01:53:11,167 --> 01:53:13,916
l didn't tell you because
l didn't want to hurt you.

1941
01:53:15,584 --> 01:53:16,916
Forgive me.

1942
01:53:36,709 --> 01:53:37,874
Mr. Sharma.

1943
01:53:39,042 --> 01:53:40,499
l'll be right with you.

1944
01:53:44,917 --> 01:53:47,708
Mr. Sharma,
Payal came to see me..

1945
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:49,458
Nothing will change, Datto.

1946
01:53:50,334 --> 01:53:52,541
AIl these things happening
the past few days..

1947
01:53:53,209 --> 01:53:54,416
Tanu coming here..

1948
01:53:56,500 --> 01:53:57,791
..l am really sorry for that.

1949
01:53:58,875 --> 01:54:02,374
You must have found me unsure, and..

1950
01:54:04,834 --> 01:54:08,083
AIl I want to say is don't worry.

1951
01:54:09,375 --> 01:54:11,291
l'll be a good husband.

1952
01:54:16,209 --> 01:54:19,333
Then get ready and come to the dais.

1953
01:54:22,584 --> 01:54:25,624
Yes, just hope things
don't get in a mess later.

1954
01:54:25,625 --> 01:54:27,791
Let that go, dear. It'll tear.

1955
01:54:27,792 --> 01:54:30,958
ls it real?
- Yes, absolutely real.

1956
01:54:30,959 --> 01:54:33,374
We'll make a similar
one for your groom.

1957
01:54:33,667 --> 01:54:36,833
Get up everyone.
The groom's here.

1958
01:54:38,250 --> 01:54:41,624
Why are you holding that?

1959
01:54:41,625 --> 01:54:44,166
Come on. Climb the horse.

1960
01:54:44,459 --> 01:54:46,374
Can't we walk or go in a car?

1961
01:54:46,375 --> 01:54:47,708
What are you saying?
lt might be your second..

1962
01:54:47,709 --> 01:54:48,999
..but it's my sister's first marriage.

1963
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:50,541
Come on, come on.

1964
01:54:50,542 --> 01:54:51,541
Bring the boy.

1965
01:54:51,750 --> 01:54:52,874
lt's alright.

1966
01:54:53,584 --> 01:54:55,583
Don't be scared.
Climb up.

1967
01:54:55,584 --> 01:54:56,249
Pappi.

1968
01:54:56,250 --> 01:54:58,916
Listen to me..

1969
01:54:58,917 --> 01:55:00,708
Give me a quarter.

1970
01:55:00,959 --> 01:55:03,458
What have you been drinking?

1971
01:55:03,459 --> 01:55:05,291
Give it to me.

1972
01:55:13,042 --> 01:55:16,083
Daddy, how about a drink?
- Are you crazy?

1973
01:55:16,084 --> 01:55:17,708
Fine, l'll have a peg.
Give me 100 rupees.

1974
01:55:17,875 --> 01:55:19,166
l don't have money.

1975
01:55:19,167 --> 01:55:20,874
What do you mean you don't?
- l don't.

1976
01:55:20,875 --> 01:55:24,208
Old man...what about the
6 month of rent that l paid you.

1977
01:55:24,209 --> 01:55:25,249
That was a year ago.

1978
01:55:25,250 --> 01:55:26,499
Fine, you can deduct
it from the dowry.

1979
01:55:26,500 --> 01:55:27,499
What dowry?

1980
01:55:27,500 --> 01:55:28,999
That's not it.
- What are you saying?

1981
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,791
Uncle, everything is
ruined and you're coming now.

1982
01:55:31,792 --> 01:55:33,583
Why you..

1983
01:55:34,417 --> 01:55:36,458
No need to be scared.

1984
01:55:36,667 --> 01:55:40,333
l'll break your head.
- So hit me. Hit me.

1985
01:55:40,750 --> 01:55:42,291
Throw away the stone.

1986
01:55:42,709 --> 01:55:45,874
We don't know whose side we're on.

1987
01:55:46,292 --> 01:55:47,624
We're on the right side.

1988
01:55:47,959 --> 01:55:49,416
We're on the right side..

1989
01:55:49,417 --> 01:55:51,166
..but which is the right side?

1990
01:55:51,167 --> 01:55:53,208
The right thing to
do is get out of here.

1991
01:55:58,459 --> 01:56:01,083
How can we just leave, Awasthi?

1992
01:56:06,792 --> 01:56:09,249
l want to feel humiliated some more.

1993
01:56:09,875 --> 01:56:11,041
Come in marriage party.

1994
01:56:28,500 --> 01:56:31,666
The smiles of their face,
joys of the heart..

1995
01:56:31,959 --> 01:56:36,874
..and shame, wonder what else
your lovers have sacrificed for you.

1996
01:56:41,709 --> 01:56:45,249
"O beloved.."

1997
01:56:46,709 --> 01:56:55,708
"I did what l didn't want to,
my world's come crashing down."

1998
01:56:55,709 --> 01:57:00,249
"A hale and hearty,
good looking girl has gone crazy."

1999
01:57:00,250 --> 01:57:12,916
"I've gone crazy."

2000
01:57:15,084 --> 01:57:18,749
"Every morning...
in the pitch darkness."

2001
01:57:19,459 --> 01:57:20,666
"I ran from home."

2002
01:57:20,667 --> 01:57:24,291
"I ran from home only for you."

2003
01:57:24,292 --> 01:57:28,374
"Without a reason,
in the middle of the night."

2004
01:57:29,042 --> 01:57:33,083
"I woke up in the middle
of the night for you."

2005
01:57:33,084 --> 01:57:37,374
"Don't listen to the world,
listen to what my heart's saying.

2006
01:57:37,375 --> 01:57:43,458
"I've gone crazy."

2007
01:57:59,250 --> 01:58:03,083
"Here and there,
and everywhere."

2008
01:58:04,042 --> 01:58:08,666
"I've come back...back to you."

2009
01:58:08,667 --> 01:58:13,249
"First the world and
now the Lord itself."

2010
01:58:13,250 --> 01:58:17,166
"I've fallen in your love."

2011
01:58:17,167 --> 01:58:21,833
"l hope you won't cry when l go away."

2012
01:58:21,834 --> 01:58:29,791
"I've gone crazy."

2013
01:58:31,709 --> 01:58:36,291
"You have gone crazy."

2014
01:58:36,292 --> 01:58:40,958
"Yes...you have...
you have gone crazy."

2015
01:58:40,959 --> 01:58:44,916
"You've gone crazy."

2016
01:58:44,917 --> 01:58:47,291
"I've gone crazy."

2017
01:58:49,084 --> 01:58:50,249
Tanu!

2018
01:58:53,209 --> 01:58:53,791
Dear.

2019
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:54,541
Greetings.

2020
01:58:54,542 --> 01:58:55,624
To bad with your greetings.

2021
01:58:55,625 --> 01:58:57,583
Aren't you ashamed
of what you're doing here?

2022
01:58:57,584 --> 01:58:58,958
She is your daughter-in-law.

2023
01:58:58,959 --> 01:59:00,624
Dear, let's go from here.

2024
01:59:04,792 --> 01:59:08,791
Tanu, don't be scared.
l am here.

2025
01:59:08,792 --> 01:59:10,083
Hey you..

2026
01:59:10,084 --> 01:59:11,041
Awasthi..

2027
01:59:11,042 --> 01:59:13,458
Abuse me, but don't hit me.
- Stop. Stop.

2028
01:59:13,834 --> 01:59:14,833
Who is he?

2029
01:59:14,834 --> 01:59:16,541
Tanu, what do you want?

2030
01:59:16,542 --> 01:59:18,208
l want to see Manu get married.

2031
01:59:18,667 --> 01:59:20,458
Don't beat me again.

2032
01:59:20,459 --> 01:59:21,958
Move back! Move back!

2033
01:59:21,959 --> 01:59:24,374
I've left a letter at
Hazratganj police station..

2034
01:59:24,375 --> 01:59:26,041
..stating that if l
don't return in 3 days..

2035
01:59:26,042 --> 01:59:28,208
..then Raja Awasthi
is responsible for my death.

2036
01:59:28,500 --> 01:59:30,583
Should l drink this? Should I?

2037
01:59:30,584 --> 01:59:32,416
You'll be charged with
sections 302 and 307..

2038
01:59:32,417 --> 01:59:33,791
..and rot in jail.

2039
01:59:34,042 --> 01:59:35,458
Move. Move.

2040
01:59:36,375 --> 01:59:38,166
l am here for my bride.

2041
01:59:38,667 --> 01:59:40,041
Your time's up.

2042
02:00:04,875 --> 02:00:14,499
Now garland each other.

2043
02:00:27,959 --> 02:00:30,458
Now they'll pour the water.

2044
02:01:17,875 --> 02:01:19,541
Do you want to say something,
Mr. Sharma?

2045
02:01:24,125 --> 02:01:25,499
This is the last round.

2046
02:01:25,875 --> 02:01:28,624
After this our marriage
will be finalized.

2047
02:01:39,667 --> 02:01:40,874
l can't do it.

2048
02:01:48,459 --> 02:01:50,458
l am an athlete, Mr. Sharma.

2049
02:01:50,875 --> 02:01:53,624
l either win or come last.

2050
02:01:54,209 --> 02:01:56,749
Never settle for consolation prize.

2051
02:01:57,542 --> 02:02:01,583
But who were you putting
up this charade for. For me?

2052
02:02:02,042 --> 02:02:04,041
Have you heard those
announcements in airplanes?

2053
02:02:04,250 --> 02:02:07,249
"Please fasten your seatbelts
before helping others."

2054
02:02:07,959 --> 02:02:10,249
You look after yourself and your wife.

2055
02:02:10,250 --> 02:02:11,916
Don't worry about me!

2056
02:02:12,375 --> 02:02:14,083
l didn't want a wedding like this.

2057
02:02:14,084 --> 02:02:15,458
Look at everyone's faces.

2058
02:02:15,875 --> 02:02:17,999
No one's happy. Not even me.

2059
02:02:31,459 --> 02:02:32,374
Thank you.

2060
02:02:32,375 --> 02:02:34,374
l'll send you the bill.

2061
02:02:34,375 --> 02:02:35,499
Just pay that.

2062
02:02:36,542 --> 02:02:37,458
Thank you.

2063
02:03:26,750 --> 02:03:29,583
Datto, will you never get married.

2064
02:03:31,750 --> 02:03:33,958
Tell me. - Will you
never get married again?

2065
02:03:34,959 --> 02:03:35,583
Datto..

2066
02:03:35,584 --> 02:03:37,874
Manoj Sharma, how are you getting
this girl everytime?

2067
02:03:37,875 --> 02:03:40,916
Why did you give birth to him?

2068
02:03:41,167 --> 02:03:42,999
In my next life,
l'll be born as your son.

2069
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:46,208
And l swear I'll sell your home..

2070
02:03:46,375 --> 02:03:48,458
..and make you two
rot in the old-age home..

2071
02:03:48,792 --> 02:03:51,458
..or my name isn't
Advocate Arun Kumar Singh.

2072
02:03:51,459 --> 02:03:52,499
Lord..

2073
02:03:52,500 --> 02:03:53,833
Tell me.
- Shut up!

2074
02:03:54,042 --> 02:03:58,791
I...Rampur Session Judge,
Rajesh Kumar Singh's son..

2075
02:03:59,084 --> 02:04:02,541
Today in this gathering..

2076
02:04:02,542 --> 02:04:05,083
Who is he?
- God knows who he is.

2077
02:04:05,084 --> 02:04:07,333
Their marriage won't
last for two days.

2078
02:04:07,334 --> 02:04:08,999
They will be ruined

2079
02:04:09,250 --> 02:04:11,333
..you will feed on each other's flesh.

2080
02:04:11,334 --> 02:04:13,791
Hey boy...stop this.

2081
02:04:16,334 --> 02:04:17,208
Yes, sister.

2082
02:04:17,417 --> 02:04:18,374
Look there.

2083
02:04:19,459 --> 02:04:23,791
"Sweetheart...your
swagger looks beautiful."

2084
02:04:24,084 --> 02:04:25,083
Cannot eat.

2085
02:04:27,542 --> 02:04:28,791
Had some 'Dahi-vada'.

2086
02:04:36,042 --> 02:04:36,749
Disgusting,

2087
02:04:36,750 --> 02:04:43,958
"Sweetheart...your swagger.."

2088
02:04:47,417 --> 02:04:50,916
lf you go looking for a 3rd one,
will she be like her too?

2089
02:04:53,709 --> 02:04:57,958
That's enough,
all my desires are fulfilled now.

2090
02:04:58,292 --> 02:05:00,791
l thought there will be a 3rd time.

2091
02:05:03,584 --> 02:05:07,249
The other day you said
you didn't miss me at aIl.

2092
02:05:09,667 --> 02:05:11,374
What do you think?

2093
02:05:16,167 --> 02:05:18,624
Isn't this the same tie l
gifted you on your 40th birthday?

2094
02:05:22,167 --> 02:05:23,666
Why did you wear it today?

2095
02:05:26,167 --> 02:05:27,833
lt was matching.

2096
02:05:28,959 --> 02:05:29,916
Matching..

2097
02:05:30,292 --> 02:05:33,416
That means you have no sentimental
attachments no value for it.

2098
02:05:33,417 --> 02:05:35,291
No, I do.
- Just a matching tie with your suit.

2099
02:05:35,292 --> 02:05:36,499
lt's just a blue tie.

2100
02:05:36,500 --> 02:05:37,583
