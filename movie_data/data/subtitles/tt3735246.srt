1
00:03:16,626 --> 00:03:18,043
As incomplete as
the sun without rays...

2
00:03:19,001 --> 00:03:20,751
And fragrance without breeze...

3
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,293
ls a ruler without
his Prime Minister.

4
00:03:24,043 --> 00:03:28,251
The demise of our Prime Minister,
Peshwa Balaji Vishwanath...

5
00:03:29,293 --> 00:03:31,168
Leaves us with a pressing question.

6
00:03:31,585 --> 00:03:36,543
Who here considers himself
worthy enough to be the next Peshwa?

7
00:03:38,168 --> 00:03:42,418
I would accept the post of Peshwa
with great honour, Your Majesty.

8
00:03:42,418 --> 00:03:44,085
Your proposal pleases me,
Panth Pratinidhi.

9
00:03:44,835 --> 00:03:47,960
Does the court approve?

10
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,876
Your Majesty...

11
00:03:49,418 --> 00:03:51,585
The only man that can protect..

12
00:03:52,001 --> 00:03:55,835
...the Maratha empire and preserve
the honour of the Peshwa's post...

13
00:03:56,668 --> 00:03:57,960
is Bajirao!

14
00:04:25,335 --> 00:04:29,251
Forgive me, Your Majesty
but this statement mocks the court.

15
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,960
You appear to be the
only one laughing, Minister.

16
00:04:32,626 --> 00:04:35,168
Every man has the
right to prove his merit.

17
00:04:35,376 --> 00:04:39,001
A son does not inherit his father's
wisdom simply by wearing his turban.

18
00:04:39,585 --> 00:04:43,626
Even a sandalwood tree needs time
to age before it produces fragrance.

19
00:04:43,626 --> 00:04:46,751
But even the youngest thorn can prick.
What say?

20
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:52,168
Never doubt the cheetah's speed,
the hawk's vision and Bajirao's sword...

21
00:04:54,668 --> 00:04:56,251
They could outwit you at any moment!

22
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,376
I, Bajirao Ballad...

23
00:05:00,168 --> 00:05:05,126
Son of Late Balaji Vishwanath,
consider myself fit for this post.

24
00:05:05,293 --> 00:05:07,960
And for that,
I am willing to pass any test.

25
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,876
A test there shall be, Bajirao.

26
00:05:11,001 --> 00:05:15,126
But I shall allow Panth Pratinidhi to decide it.

27
00:05:26,876 --> 00:05:34,751
Prove your marksmanship by splitting
that peacock feather into two, Bajirao.

28
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:38,918
Let your weapons speak of your wisdom.

29
00:05:39,751 --> 00:05:42,543
Now let's see some of that
cheetah's speed and hawk's vision...

30
00:06:29,335 --> 00:06:33,043
Your Majesty, the challenge was to
split the peacock feather into two halves...

31
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:38,626
And the court witnesses that
the feather is still intact.

32
00:06:38,626 --> 00:06:40,293
But shorter than before.

33
00:06:41,293 --> 00:06:43,543
Sift through the mud and
you will find the other half there.

34
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:52,710
That was proof of my marksmanship...

35
00:06:53,835 --> 00:06:55,043
Now for the thought behind it.

36
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,918
That soil is India and that
peacock feather is the tree..

37
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:01,418
...of the Mughal kingdom
with its roots in Delhi...

38
00:07:02,835 --> 00:07:04,543
The arrow is...

39
00:07:05,085 --> 00:07:07,168
The Maratha empire.

40
00:07:07,876 --> 00:07:10,668
Strike at the root and
even the biggest tree will fall.

41
00:07:11,043 --> 00:07:13,418
You have a brilliant mind, Peshwa!

42
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:48,668
Behold the pride of
the Maratha empire...

43
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:51,585
The righteous and dutiful...

44
00:07:51,585 --> 00:07:55,460
Peshwa Bajirao Ballad!

45
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:59,168
Behold!

46
00:08:58,293 --> 00:09:00,585
This story belongs
to an era in history...

47
00:09:00,585 --> 00:09:05,793
When King Shahu Maharaj
held the reins of the Maratha empire.

48
00:09:08,793 --> 00:09:11,126
And his Prime Minister
was Bajirao Ballad.

49
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:22,585
A sword as swift as lightening...
A will as immovable as the himalayas.

50
00:09:22,585 --> 00:09:27,835
The radiance of his clan on his face...
And only one dream in his eyes...

51
00:09:27,835 --> 00:09:32,001
To see the Maratha flag paint the
skies in Delhi, saffron with victory.

52
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:42,126
In ten years, Bajirao had captured
half of India with his leadership,..

53
00:09:42,126 --> 00:09:45,751
...political prowess
and unmatched battle skills.

54
00:09:50,668 --> 00:09:53,751
Stories of Bajirao's
valour made headlines..

55
00:09:53,751 --> 00:09:55,835
...from the Nizam in South,
to the Mughals in the north.

56
00:09:59,668 --> 00:10:01,960
We shall fulfil King Shivaji's dream...

57
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:05,335
...Defeat the Mughals
and make India a hindu state.

58
00:10:08,376 --> 00:10:10,501
Unlike the enemy's
jewels and wealth,..

59
00:10:10,501 --> 00:10:12,710
...our treasury is rich with blood,
ready for sacrifice.

60
00:10:16,418 --> 00:10:19,710
We owe our every breath
to the Maratha empire.

61
00:10:24,001 --> 00:10:26,543
We are the thunder
in the face of any storm...

62
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:29,001
And we are a sea of
fire in the face of thunder!

63
00:10:57,001 --> 00:11:00,126
Bajirao Ballad shall break
away all shackles of defeat..

64
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:02,668
...and unfurl the
saffron flag in victory.

65
00:11:02,668 --> 00:11:07,460
(War Cry)

66
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:55,751
While Bajirao was weilding his sword
to change the map of India...

67
00:11:56,085 --> 00:11:58,793
A magnificent palace,
Shaniwar Wada,

68
00:11:58,793 --> 00:12:02,001
...was being constructed in Pune,
in his honour.

69
00:12:03,001 --> 00:12:08,043
(Chants)

70
00:12:08,335 --> 00:12:10,210
Kashi, where are you going in
the middle of prayers?

71
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:11,126
Bhanu has come!

72
00:12:11,293 --> 00:12:12,001
Bhanu who?

73
00:12:12,001 --> 00:12:15,001
A dear childhood friend...
I'll be right back with her.

74
00:12:15,001 --> 00:12:16,085
Be back soon!

75
00:12:16,085 --> 00:12:17,460
Yes, right away.

76
00:12:21,376 --> 00:12:24,793
When will Kashi ever learn!

77
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:28,668
Bhanu, when did you arrive?

78
00:12:28,876 --> 00:12:31,585
And why are you out here,
you should've come into the prayer service.

79
00:12:31,585 --> 00:12:32,960
That's alright.

80
00:12:33,668 --> 00:12:36,751
It's been a while since we last met.
All well, Kashi?

81
00:12:36,751 --> 00:12:39,293
Bhanu, when did this happen?

82
00:12:39,918 --> 00:12:41,210
What happened to your husband?

83
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:43,001
He was murdered.

84
00:12:43,626 --> 00:12:44,668
BY Whom?

85
00:12:44,668 --> 00:12:45,460
By the Peshwa.

86
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:47,168
Tread carefully Bhanu!

87
00:12:47,168 --> 00:12:48,626
You are accusing the Peshwa of murder!

88
00:12:48,626 --> 00:12:49,626
He was accused of being a spy...

89
00:12:49,626 --> 00:12:52,376
The Peshwa would
never do such injustice.

90
00:12:57,585 --> 00:12:58,668
What's in this?

91
00:12:59,001 --> 00:13:00,168
The Peshwa's justice...

92
00:13:00,168 --> 00:13:01,793
My husband's ashes.

93
00:13:03,085 --> 00:13:06,168
Today you sanctify your home...

94
00:13:06,168 --> 00:13:08,585
While mine burns to ashes.

95
00:13:08,918 --> 00:13:10,960
I ache for my husband, Kashi.

96
00:13:11,126 --> 00:13:13,418
As will you!

97
00:13:41,501 --> 00:13:44,251
My Lord, a soldier has come
from Bundelkhand.

98
00:13:44,543 --> 00:13:46,251
He has a message from King Chatrasal.

99
00:13:46,668 --> 00:13:47,918
The soldier wishes to meet you.

100
00:13:47,918 --> 00:13:50,126
Does the King wish to offer me
his daughter's hand?

101
00:13:51,085 --> 00:13:54,043
He says Mohammad Bangash's
troops have surrounded his fort...

102
00:13:54,376 --> 00:13:55,960
And he needs our assistance.

103
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:58,793
Are we to fight our own battles
or help the king, Tukoji?

104
00:13:59,126 --> 00:14:00,626
We must reach Siraunja.

105
00:14:00,626 --> 00:14:01,585
Send the soldier away.

106
00:14:01,585 --> 00:14:03,543
But Sir, the soldier is insisting
on meeting the Peshwa.

107
00:14:03,543 --> 00:14:05,293
Tukoji, leave!

108
00:14:05,835 --> 00:14:06,960
Certainly.

109
00:14:08,168 --> 00:14:10,335
If we take this valley,
we will reach quicker.

110
00:14:10,835 --> 00:14:12,501
You cannot meet the Peshwa.

111
00:14:12,501 --> 00:14:14,585
Stop him! No one must go inside...

112
00:15:16,876 --> 00:15:21,168
Panth, please send
her away respectfully.

113
00:15:23,293 --> 00:15:24,585
Bundelkhand is in danger.

114
00:15:24,585 --> 00:15:27,460
The Rajput queens and princesses
are poised to self-immolate.

115
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,751
We need your help.

116
00:15:29,751 --> 00:15:33,751
When Bundelkhand has a weapon
like you, what help should I be?

117
00:15:35,085 --> 00:15:37,293
I cannot help you right now,
please leave.

118
00:15:41,293 --> 00:15:43,710
You may lose your life over this!

119
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:44,918
It hardly matters.

120
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,168
I swore while leaving
Bundelkhand that..

121
00:15:48,168 --> 00:15:50,710
...l would return only with
Peshwa Bajirao, or not at all.

122
00:15:52,793 --> 00:15:55,918
I put forth a plea believing you
to be God, but you aren't even human.

123
00:16:01,668 --> 00:16:02,835
What is your name?

124
00:16:03,501 --> 00:16:04,543
Mastani.

125
00:16:06,001 --> 00:16:09,835
I like your courage and your approach...

126
00:16:10,418 --> 00:16:11,626
Decamp, Panth.

127
00:16:12,001 --> 00:16:13,001
We ride to Bundelkhand!

128
00:16:13,501 --> 00:16:15,126
But Sir,
what will we tell His Majesty?

129
00:16:15,293 --> 00:16:16,960
His Majesty will
be happy to know that..

130
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,376
...one Hindu monarch
is going to help another.

131
00:16:19,793 --> 00:16:21,501
How far is Bundelkhand from here?

132
00:16:21,501 --> 00:16:22,043
It's a five day march.

133
00:16:22,043 --> 00:16:23,751
We shall get there in two...
- That's impossible.

134
00:16:23,751 --> 00:16:25,376
Let the enemy think that way...

135
00:16:26,501 --> 00:16:29,376
Bajirao's fame is carried
by his speed, Mastani...

136
00:16:31,293 --> 00:16:32,418
Let's go!

137
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:34,001
Final warning...

138
00:17:34,001 --> 00:17:42,460
"...surrender by daybreak or face
dire consequences" - Mohammad Bangash.

139
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:45,960
No word of help from the Peshwa.

140
00:17:46,793 --> 00:17:49,168
That leaves us only two choices...

141
00:17:49,335 --> 00:17:52,376
Surrender or martyrdom!

142
00:17:52,376 --> 00:17:54,251
MARTYRDOM!!

143
00:18:02,793 --> 00:18:04,835
Ruhani Begum! What's going on?

144
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:10,376
My king, if enemy
breaches the fort walls...

145
00:18:10,376 --> 00:18:14,168
The women shall surrender to
this fire, to safeguard our dignity!

146
00:18:14,335 --> 00:18:16,168
My king!

147
00:18:16,335 --> 00:18:18,585
I see torchlights
coming in from the East!!

148
00:18:18,585 --> 00:18:21,418
That must be Mastani
arriving with help.

149
00:18:51,168 --> 00:18:55,001
General! An army approaches
from beyond those hills.

150
00:18:59,626 --> 00:19:01,585
Swerve the cannons!

151
00:19:14,418 --> 00:19:18,376
We've been tricked! About-face...
Head back!

152
00:19:18,376 --> 00:19:21,835
There is no army here...
It's just cattle!

153
00:19:27,335 --> 00:19:28,585
We have managed to trick them!

154
00:19:28,585 --> 00:19:30,210
Their cannons have been swerved.

155
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:33,793
Mastani, reach inside the fort through
the secret tunnel...

156
00:19:33,793 --> 00:19:35,668
And signal me once inside.

157
00:19:36,501 --> 00:19:39,543
We'll be ready for attack.

158
00:20:06,418 --> 00:20:07,126
Mastani!

159
00:20:07,293 --> 00:20:08,751
The Maratha army is here, father.

160
00:20:08,751 --> 00:20:12,210
Bundelkhand is forever indebted to you...
- There is no debt in duty, father.

161
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:15,293
Go ahead and declare war,
I'll signal the Peshwa.

162
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:46,751
(War Cry)

163
00:21:37,376 --> 00:21:40,001
Attack!

164
00:25:25,293 --> 00:25:27,126
Congratulations on
your victory, Peshwa.

165
00:25:27,126 --> 00:25:30,418
I wish you and Mastani the same.
How is she now?

166
00:25:30,418 --> 00:25:32,960
Wounded, yet grateful.

167
00:25:33,293 --> 00:25:36,501
I don't know how
I can repay this debt.

168
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:40,501
I seek no reward, dear King...

169
00:25:42,293 --> 00:25:46,918
All I ask for, is the permission to
bid farewell. I must reach Siraunja.

170
00:25:46,918 --> 00:25:49,001
I won't hear of it!

171
00:25:49,001 --> 00:25:51,585
You must celebrate this Holi
(festival of colours) with us!

172
00:25:53,293 --> 00:25:55,460
My lady, it appears you've truly
been playing Holi

173
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:58,043
And with none
other than the Peshwa.

174
00:25:59,126 --> 00:26:02,335
He carried you here in his arms,
wounded and unconscious...

175
00:26:02,335 --> 00:26:06,293
But even in that state you were
entwined with him as though one body.

176
00:26:07,001 --> 00:26:09,043
Congratulations on this
victorious morning, My Lady.

177
00:26:09,293 --> 00:26:11,585
I would like a few moments alone
with Mastani Saheba.

178
00:26:11,585 --> 00:26:12,501
Leave us...

179
00:26:12,501 --> 00:26:15,668
These are my personal chambers,
Peshwa... Not your battleground.

180
00:26:16,293 --> 00:26:18,710
One needs my permission to leave.

181
00:26:20,626 --> 00:26:25,626
I said... No one leaves without
my permission.

182
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:29,418
Besides, it could be dangerous being
alone with you.

183
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:31,335
Is that so!
Do you not trust me, My Lady?

184
00:26:31,335 --> 00:26:32,876
I'm afraid it's myself I don't trust.

185
00:26:32,876 --> 00:26:36,418
My Rajput blood could make me
avenge your assault.

186
00:26:36,418 --> 00:26:37,793
You have every right.

187
00:26:38,168 --> 00:26:39,710
I owe you my life.

188
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:41,168
I owe you my homeland.

189
00:26:41,335 --> 00:26:43,793
I would give even
my life for you, Mastani.

190
00:26:45,418 --> 00:26:47,835
It appears this account must be
settled in private after all!

191
00:26:57,543 --> 00:26:59,460
You deserve to be praised,
Mastani Saheba...

192
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,418
My sword has never spared
a foe on the battlefield,"

193
00:27:04,418 --> 00:27:06,251
...but somehow you escaped its wrath.

194
00:27:07,335 --> 00:27:09,918
I believe your wound is deep.

195
00:27:10,751 --> 00:27:12,460
Let me see it.

196
00:27:12,835 --> 00:27:15,460
Rajputs do not make
a show of their wounds.

197
00:27:25,085 --> 00:27:27,668
To others,
this may be a battle scar...

198
00:27:28,793 --> 00:27:31,626
But for me,
you are the moon bathed in color.

199
00:27:40,668 --> 00:27:43,168
The poison had to be
stopped from spreading.

200
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:46,876
I've seen your wounds, Mastani...

201
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:49,876
You are no longer a Rajput.

202
00:27:52,793 --> 00:27:56,001
What you see is merely
the mark of your sword.

203
00:27:58,001 --> 00:28:00,626
But it is my heart that bleeds.

204
00:28:03,751 --> 00:28:05,960
Even the Peshwa has a heart!

205
00:29:09,751 --> 00:29:15,418
" On this festival of colours "

206
00:29:15,418 --> 00:29:19,585
Paint me red in the color of love.

207
00:29:19,585 --> 00:29:26,251
Oh you playful one,
like Lord Krishna.

208
00:29:31,876 --> 00:29:37,376
I'm mesmerised looking at you...

209
00:29:45,335 --> 00:29:50,835
Hold me close,
instead of looking from afar...

210
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:42,626
Playfully you twist my arm...

211
00:30:42,626 --> 00:30:46,501
Like Lord Krishna with Radha.

212
00:30:57,585 --> 00:31:01,710
And when I protest, you embrace me...

213
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:07,168
You refuse to let go of me...

214
00:31:15,418 --> 00:31:20,793
" Blushing I turn red...
The color of love. "

215
00:32:22,335 --> 00:32:27,626
Fortune favours the brave, My Lady...
And fortunate you are, indeed!

216
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:30,918
The Peshwa has asked for
a paan (after meal delicacy).

217
00:32:30,918 --> 00:32:33,168
Here, it is your excuse to see him.

218
00:32:33,335 --> 00:32:34,876
I no longer need excuses.

219
00:32:36,418 --> 00:32:37,918
This dagger?

220
00:32:38,751 --> 00:32:39,835
The Peshwa gave it to me!

221
00:32:39,835 --> 00:32:41,585
Dear God! And you accepted it?

222
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:44,501
Don't you know that as per
the custom in Bundelkhand...

223
00:32:44,501 --> 00:32:47,835
A girl is married to
a man by accepting his dagger!

224
00:32:48,918 --> 00:32:51,418
Did you accept it?

225
00:32:52,793 --> 00:32:54,085
I accepted it.

226
00:32:54,085 --> 00:32:55,501
And he?

227
00:33:19,085 --> 00:33:20,001
Your paan.

228
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:24,501
And if I weren't awake?

229
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,668
I would will the night
to go on for eternity...

230
00:33:27,668 --> 00:33:29,168
And gaze upon you forever.

231
00:33:29,168 --> 00:33:30,876
But that is impossible.

232
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:34,210
Time and destiny cannot
be controlled by mortals.

233
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:38,293
What cannot be controlled by mortals
can be swayed by the power of love.

234
00:33:38,293 --> 00:33:41,626
So can love stop the sun from rising?

235
00:33:59,626 --> 00:34:00,793
It just did.

236
00:34:02,876 --> 00:34:06,251
Do have your paan,
or my hospitality might be questioned.

237
00:34:08,126 --> 00:34:10,335
Mastani, I shall be gone tomorrow.

238
00:34:10,793 --> 00:34:11,668
What of it?

239
00:34:12,168 --> 00:34:14,168
Perhaps we may never meet again.

240
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:17,751
You are in my heart, like a prayer.

241
00:34:20,043 --> 00:34:22,418
The mention of your
name shall be my worship...

242
00:34:58,668 --> 00:35:00,751
My Lady, the Peshwa is leaving!

243
00:35:01,043 --> 00:35:04,876
Entire Bundelkhand has gathered for
his farewell, except you.

244
00:35:05,168 --> 00:35:06,293
Come, My Lady!

245
00:35:07,876 --> 00:35:09,918
Such arrogance does
not become you, My Lady.

246
00:35:10,376 --> 00:35:13,168
You mistake love for arrogance.

247
00:35:13,335 --> 00:35:15,335
What sort of love is this?
He is leaving, and you...

248
00:35:15,335 --> 00:35:18,876
Watching him go will
be the death of me.

249
00:35:18,876 --> 00:35:21,751
God forbid! But this meeting
will be left incomplete.

250
00:35:21,751 --> 00:35:24,751
An incomplete meeting leaves
the promise of another.

251
00:35:25,001 --> 00:35:27,835
And what if destiny doesn't allow it?

252
00:35:30,293 --> 00:35:32,960
Mastani writes her own destiny.

253
00:35:57,043 --> 00:36:00,126
We may be greatly
indebted to the Peshwa...

254
00:36:00,585 --> 00:36:03,835
But I refuse to send our daughter
to Pune as an obligation, My King.

255
00:36:04,335 --> 00:36:07,460
I understand that our marriage
has never been valid in the society...

256
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:09,001
Because I am
Muslim and you're Hindu.

257
00:36:09,001 --> 00:36:10,876
It is my own decision to go to Pune...

258
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:14,210
I am wed to the Peshwa's dagger.

259
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:17,960
This is a custom in Bundelkhand,
not Pune.

260
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:22,543
And do not forget that the Peshwa
is Hindu Brahmin and you are Muslim.

261
00:36:22,543 --> 00:36:25,376
Mastani has Hindu Rajput blood too.

262
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:29,126
She worships Allah and Krishna alike.

263
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:32,126
Jodha and Akbar put aside religious
differences in the name of politics.

264
00:36:32,126 --> 00:36:34,376
Mastani is doing the same,
but for love.

265
00:36:35,001 --> 00:36:36,376
Let her go.

266
00:36:36,376 --> 00:36:39,126
Even so! He will never accept
her as his legitimate wife.

267
00:36:39,293 --> 00:36:41,043
Radha was never Lord Krishna's wife...

268
00:36:41,501 --> 00:36:43,876
But their names are inseparable.

269
00:36:44,501 --> 00:36:45,710
Yes, but they are Gods!

270
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:47,168
And love is worship...

271
00:36:48,376 --> 00:36:51,001
For which one needs no permission.

272
00:36:57,751 --> 00:36:59,793
May God fulfill your wishes!

273
00:37:03,043 --> 00:37:04,751
Stay blessed!

274
00:37:31,501 --> 00:37:35,918
My beautiful love has returned...

275
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:40,043
Praise the Lord!

276
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,251
A moment, My Lady...

277
00:39:57,418 --> 00:39:59,168
You have not taken my
name this time. (Marathi tradition)

278
00:39:59,168 --> 00:40:00,126
Why, brother!

279
00:40:00,126 --> 00:40:01,668
It's a new era!
New palace, new customs.

280
00:40:01,668 --> 00:40:03,626
Why must the lady always
take the man's name?

281
00:40:03,626 --> 00:40:08,710
You take her name this time,
or else no entering your new chambers!

282
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:12,168
But it is a custom for women
to say their husbands' name...

283
00:40:16,293 --> 00:40:20,335
No diamond can match the Kohinoor's
sparkle and grace.

284
00:40:20,335 --> 00:40:24,293
And no name but Bajirao's
lights up Kashi's face.

285
00:40:24,751 --> 00:40:27,293
Very good!

286
00:40:30,085 --> 00:40:31,626
This way, Peshwa Saheb.

287
00:40:31,626 --> 00:40:33,001
My Lady...

288
00:40:33,001 --> 00:40:34,835
You are entering your new chambers
for the first time.

289
00:40:34,835 --> 00:40:35,793
What childishness is this!

290
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:38,668
You swore on me...

291
00:40:38,668 --> 00:40:41,793
So don't open
your eyes until I say so!

292
00:40:42,918 --> 00:40:44,085
Don't you trust me?

293
00:40:44,085 --> 00:40:46,251
Trust a warrior?

294
00:40:46,543 --> 00:40:48,460
You never know when he may attack!

295
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:51,126
Now, open your eyes.

296
00:40:51,501 --> 00:40:52,293
What do you think?

297
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:53,751
Beautiful!!

298
00:40:55,543 --> 00:41:00,251
This is nothing compared to the
rest of Shanivaar Wada.

299
00:41:08,918 --> 00:41:11,001
Tell me something, My Lady...

300
00:41:11,501 --> 00:41:12,501
What?

301
00:41:13,043 --> 00:41:16,293
How come I still see it in your eyes?

302
00:41:16,835 --> 00:41:17,501
What?

303
00:41:17,501 --> 00:41:18,585
Longing!

304
00:41:18,585 --> 00:41:22,960
Because it keeps me company
in your long absences.

305
00:41:23,585 --> 00:41:25,501
Oh dear... Where is it?

306
00:41:26,043 --> 00:41:26,876
What?

307
00:41:26,876 --> 00:41:28,960
Your mistress!!

308
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,751
Your dagger?

309
00:41:32,001 --> 00:41:33,543
Just as well you've forgotten it.

310
00:41:33,918 --> 00:41:35,626
It will no longer come between us.

311
00:41:40,043 --> 00:41:43,501
Have I offended you by
calling your dagger a mistress?

312
00:41:45,043 --> 00:41:47,418
I talk too much!

313
00:41:50,918 --> 00:41:53,585
King Chatrasaal has
showered us with gifts.

314
00:41:55,418 --> 00:41:56,543
I am pleased!

315
00:41:56,543 --> 00:41:58,876
The timing couldn't have been better...

316
00:41:59,876 --> 00:42:02,543
Expenses had been piling up.

317
00:42:02,918 --> 00:42:05,918
So helping Bundelkhand
has proved profitable for us.

318
00:42:07,876 --> 00:42:08,876
What is this?

319
00:42:34,835 --> 00:42:37,460
Who are you?

320
00:42:37,918 --> 00:42:39,793
This is King Chatrasaal's daughter.

321
00:42:39,793 --> 00:42:43,293
I wasn't aware he had
such a beautiful daughter.

322
00:42:44,001 --> 00:42:45,876
I 'm very pleased to
make your acquaintance.

323
00:42:46,293 --> 00:42:47,918
As am I, thank you!

324
00:42:48,293 --> 00:42:49,460
What is your name?

325
00:42:50,085 --> 00:42:50,960
Mastani.

326
00:42:51,293 --> 00:42:53,335
Mastani... Beautiful name.

327
00:42:54,585 --> 00:42:58,335
Your father has many wives,
whose daughter are you?

328
00:43:01,168 --> 00:43:02,501
Ruhani Begum's.

329
00:43:03,543 --> 00:43:04,876
I see, you are a Muslim.

330
00:43:05,043 --> 00:43:08,918
King Chatrasaal needn't
have sent his daughter..

331
00:43:08,918 --> 00:43:12,001
...all the way here
simply to deliver gifts!

332
00:43:12,626 --> 00:43:14,751
What say, Chimaji?

333
00:43:21,210 --> 00:43:22,960
This dagger belongs to Bajirao!

334
00:43:23,168 --> 00:43:27,918
In Bundelkhand we observe a custom
where girls are wed to daggers.

335
00:43:30,376 --> 00:43:34,543
Perhaps amongst Muslims and Rajputs.

336
00:43:34,543 --> 00:43:38,043
In the Peshwa regime, we do not
accept such political ties.

337
00:43:38,043 --> 00:43:40,001
But I am already married to him!

338
00:43:43,085 --> 00:43:46,460
Chimaji, please make arrangements
for her stay elsewhere.

339
00:43:46,668 --> 00:43:50,918
Do meet me before you
return to Bundelkhand.

340
00:44:00,210 --> 00:44:02,126
My dear...

341
00:44:02,335 --> 00:44:04,626
If you stare any longer,
you will cast an evil eye on me.

342
00:44:04,626 --> 00:44:07,335
I am trying to remove it.

343
00:45:45,293 --> 00:45:46,543
Going to war?

344
00:45:46,751 --> 00:45:48,001
I have decided...

345
00:45:48,335 --> 00:45:50,793
Next time,
I shall accompany you to war.

346
00:45:51,001 --> 00:45:52,501
No matter what anyone says.

347
00:45:53,626 --> 00:45:56,293
But you cannot ride a horse.
How do you expect to come?

348
00:45:56,293 --> 00:46:00,293
I'll go to the stable, mount my horse,
crack the whip...

349
00:46:00,293 --> 00:46:02,751
And be off like the wind.
Here comes Kashi!!

350
00:46:13,001 --> 00:46:15,543
We haven't even reached the
battlefield yet and you've started.

351
00:46:15,543 --> 00:46:17,835
What else does this warrior need?

352
00:46:18,501 --> 00:46:22,626
A bit of land, two square meals, a
piece of open sky, a steed, a sword...

353
00:46:22,626 --> 00:46:23,835
And my Kashi.

354
00:46:24,293 --> 00:46:26,210
Altogether, twenty-seven.

355
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:27,126
How so?

356
00:46:27,418 --> 00:46:28,918
Twenty-seven wounds!

357
00:46:29,668 --> 00:46:33,626
And this time you let
the enemy get too close...

358
00:46:34,043 --> 00:46:35,793
And now to avoid the
twenty-eighth wound...

359
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:40,668
This ring will protect
you from both the evil eye..

360
00:46:40,668 --> 00:46:42,918
And the enemy's sword.

361
00:46:49,710 --> 00:46:53,085
My Lady, I do not trust
the intentions of those people.

362
00:46:53,710 --> 00:46:56,001
These are no guests' chambers!

363
00:46:56,293 --> 00:46:58,501
It's a strategy to demean you.

364
00:46:59,293 --> 00:47:01,126
If they can put you
up amonst courtesans,..

365
00:47:01,126 --> 00:47:02,710
...they can ask you to
dance at their court next!

366
00:47:04,001 --> 00:47:04,960
My Lady!

367
00:47:06,793 --> 00:47:09,251
Well, well...
Look at the butterfly!

368
00:47:11,168 --> 00:47:15,001
My lady, it was unwise
to send our soldiers home.

369
00:47:15,835 --> 00:47:17,960
We are in a strange land,
surrounded by strangers.

370
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,460
You never know what
problems might arise.

371
00:47:20,168 --> 00:47:24,251
What kind of people would house
a guest amongst courtesans.

372
00:47:24,585 --> 00:47:26,501
And that too the daughter
of King Chatrasaal.

373
00:47:26,793 --> 00:47:29,335
Swords would be raised in Bundelkhand
if they caught wind of this.

374
00:47:29,626 --> 00:47:31,751
Yet you sit here silently...

375
00:48:08,335 --> 00:48:10,585
I know you feel humiliated, My Lady.

376
00:48:12,918 --> 00:48:15,876
Let us return home rather
than be insulted here.

377
00:48:16,293 --> 00:48:18,960
If he truly loves you, the Peshwa
will come after you, to Bundelkhand.

378
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:23,126
One more thing,
no matter your efforts...

379
00:48:23,543 --> 00:48:27,126
They will never
let him learn you are here.

380
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:31,668
And I will never let
them forget my love for him.

381
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:42,126
My Lord, you are now witnessing the
most beautiful section of Shanivaar Wada...

382
00:48:42,293 --> 00:48:43,335
The Palace of Mirrors.

383
00:48:43,585 --> 00:48:44,543
Whoa, Chimaji...

384
00:48:45,876 --> 00:48:47,043
It's unreal!

385
00:48:47,918 --> 00:48:50,543
While you have been busy fighting
our enemies for years...

386
00:48:50,543 --> 00:48:52,043
Your brother
has been building this.

387
00:48:52,335 --> 00:48:55,043
Chimaji, you have brought
the Taj Mahal to Pune.

388
00:48:55,043 --> 00:48:58,626
And you shall witness the true
splendour of this place tonight...

389
00:48:58,626 --> 00:49:00,168
When we celebrate the New Year.

390
00:49:00,168 --> 00:49:02,501
Truly this is a dreamworld, brother.

391
00:49:02,751 --> 00:49:06,376
The true magic of this dreamworld
lies in the wonder at your feet.

392
00:49:07,126 --> 00:49:07,960
How do you mean?

393
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:10,085
At this very moment Bajirao,
if Kashi desires..

394
00:49:10,085 --> 00:49:11,960
...she can see you and
Nana from her chambers.

395
00:49:12,376 --> 00:49:15,960
Are you saying Kashi can see both father
and son from the comfort of her room?

396
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:17,126
Therein lies the magic!

397
00:49:17,126 --> 00:49:18,876
That lotus has a
mechanism that makes..

398
00:49:18,876 --> 00:49:20,960
...your reflection shine
from these mirrors...

399
00:49:21,168 --> 00:49:24,626
Straight onto the
little window in Kashi's room.

400
00:49:24,626 --> 00:49:26,293
My Lady!!

401
00:49:27,001 --> 00:49:30,501
There's a beam coming
through the window.

402
00:49:30,501 --> 00:49:31,376
Really!

403
00:49:31,376 --> 00:49:34,960
Yes, really, come on, come quickly!

404
00:49:43,418 --> 00:49:45,876
Then traveling through
the glass on the water,..

405
00:49:45,876 --> 00:49:48,001
...it reflects onto the
curtain in her chambers.

406
00:49:52,126 --> 00:49:54,751
Quickly, My Lady, quickly!

407
00:49:54,751 --> 00:49:57,251
Wait a moment!

408
00:50:01,168 --> 00:50:04,751
Oh! We can see Bajirao here although
he's in the Palace of Mirrors.

409
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:06,043
It's magic!

410
00:50:06,043 --> 00:50:10,085
Just look at how
handsome our Bajirao is.

411
00:50:10,876 --> 00:50:13,293
Hey! Stop casting the evil eye on him.

412
00:50:13,501 --> 00:50:15,335
A sister can never cast
an evil eye on her brother.

413
00:50:15,626 --> 00:50:18,751
But I've heard the Nawab's wives yearn
to set eyes on him.

414
00:50:18,751 --> 00:50:22,126
I've heard they would gladly pay his
weight in gold for a glimpse of him.

415
00:50:22,126 --> 00:50:24,960
Let them pay his weight in diamonds
if they want...

416
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:28,001
My Bajirao has never
so much as looked at another woman.

417
00:50:28,585 --> 00:50:30,001
Understood!

418
00:50:38,501 --> 00:50:42,668
Like an angel descended from heaven...

419
00:50:42,918 --> 00:50:45,960
Her tresses exuding
a divine fragrance...

420
00:50:46,335 --> 00:50:50,460
Here she comes...

421
00:51:18,085 --> 00:51:25,043
Here she comes... A vision in gold.

422
00:51:44,501 --> 00:51:50,710
I am intoxicated by your love

423
00:52:08,293 --> 00:52:14,626
My love is no secret

424
00:52:14,626 --> 00:52:23,168
The world tried to stop me,
but look where love brought me...

425
00:52:23,376 --> 00:52:29,960
They say Mastani is
intoxicated by your love...

426
00:53:35,501 --> 00:53:41,501
First, you wounded my heart...

427
00:53:47,335 --> 00:53:53,501
Then, you healed it with your love...

428
00:53:59,626 --> 00:54:05,251
" Your love has become my identity..."

429
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:20,293
And loving you is my purpose.

430
00:54:59,293 --> 00:55:02,501
Every corner is illuminated
by your beauty...

431
00:55:11,751 --> 00:55:14,793
You are indeed intoxicated by love,
Mastani...

432
00:55:14,793 --> 00:55:17,668
Your soul is pure and your love,
divine...

433
00:56:22,376 --> 00:56:26,460
You have been aptly named Mastani,
one who dances to her own tune.

434
00:56:27,876 --> 00:56:31,585
I'm surprised but happy
to see you here in Pune.

435
00:56:32,918 --> 00:56:36,793
This paan...
A token of my hospitality.

436
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:47,960
We shall meet tomorrow.

437
00:57:30,710 --> 00:57:34,335
Your capabilities greatly
exceed my expectations.

438
00:57:35,043 --> 00:57:36,626
You are a talented dancer.

439
00:57:37,210 --> 00:57:38,585
Thank you.

440
00:57:38,835 --> 00:57:42,418
Please pay me a further compliment,
accept my alliance.

441
00:57:43,043 --> 00:57:44,876
Of course I have.

442
00:57:50,501 --> 00:57:53,543
You are now allied with the kingdom
as a court dancer.

443
00:57:54,168 --> 00:57:58,001
Very soon you will dance at
the king's court in the capital.

444
00:57:58,460 --> 00:58:01,293
Do you not like my offering?

445
00:58:01,293 --> 00:58:06,168
I cherish your every offering,
be it an anklet or a son...

446
00:58:06,501 --> 00:58:10,960
The more you try to distance him
from me, the closer I shall get to him.

447
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:13,043
Then keep trying endlessly.

448
00:58:13,876 --> 00:58:19,710
A dancer's place is always below
the throne, on the court's floor.

449
00:58:21,043 --> 00:58:25,335
I have always been
complimented on my beauty...

450
00:58:26,418 --> 00:58:28,126
Today watching a woman of..

451
00:58:28,793 --> 00:58:32,168
...your standing
threatened by it, makes me proud.

452
00:58:34,835 --> 00:58:37,543
Prepare to leave for the Capital.

453
00:58:43,293 --> 00:58:45,710
It appears no one has sobered from
last night's performance.

454
00:58:45,876 --> 00:58:48,960
Look around,
not a soul wishes to work!

455
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:53,043
What is a warrior before whom a beauty
is not compelled to lower her gaze...

456
00:58:53,501 --> 00:58:56,751
What is a beauty before whom a warrior
is not compelled to lower his sword?

457
00:58:56,751 --> 00:58:59,918
Bravo, Peshwa!... Well said!

458
00:59:00,085 --> 00:59:04,751
The brave Chimaji is here!

459
00:59:05,001 --> 00:59:08,001
Chimaji your presence indicates
our campaigns have been audited.

460
00:59:08,001 --> 00:59:10,001
What is the outcome?

461
00:59:10,001 --> 00:59:12,543
Discounting endowments
from Bundelkhand,..

462
00:59:12,543 --> 00:59:15,751
...none of the three campaigns
have enriched our treasury.

463
00:59:15,751 --> 00:59:17,793
This is where you are wrong, brother.

464
00:59:18,293 --> 00:59:19,918
How have we not been enriched?

465
00:59:19,918 --> 00:59:23,418
First - the glory of victory.

466
00:59:26,001 --> 00:59:28,918
Second - shaming Bangash with defeat.

467
00:59:29,293 --> 00:59:32,460
Third - tolling the
Maratha bell in Delhi.

468
00:59:34,543 --> 00:59:38,668
Fourth - the saffron flag once again
stands strong against the blue sky.

469
00:59:38,668 --> 00:59:42,960
Praise the lord!

470
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:46,626
And fifth - a lifetime's
bond with Bundelkhand.

471
00:59:46,626 --> 00:59:49,710
And sixth, My Lord, you forget!

472
00:59:49,710 --> 00:59:53,710
A splendid dancer like
Mastani to entertain us!

473
01:00:03,543 --> 01:00:06,751
Chimaji, see to it our hospitality towards
Mastani Saheba is in no way lacking.

474
01:00:07,043 --> 01:00:09,085
Of course... Rest assured I will.

475
01:00:09,460 --> 01:00:11,126
She's lodged at Hirabagh Palace.

476
01:00:11,126 --> 01:00:13,251
Send a messenger to tell her
I shall visit this evening.

477
01:00:16,293 --> 01:00:17,168
That won't be possible.

478
01:00:17,335 --> 01:00:18,126
Why?

479
01:00:18,293 --> 01:00:19,918
Because you must leave for
the capital today, My Lord.

480
01:00:19,918 --> 01:00:21,376
I can do that tomorrow.

481
01:00:21,376 --> 01:00:24,626
His Majesty awaits you, you
must present yourself there on time.

482
01:00:24,626 --> 01:00:26,751
You... Fool!

483
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:29,918
Reign in your tongue... Understood?

484
01:00:33,335 --> 01:00:36,960
To the capital!

485
01:00:49,168 --> 01:00:50,626
Welcome, Bajirao.

486
01:00:51,043 --> 01:00:52,626
You were impatiently awaited.

487
01:00:52,626 --> 01:00:55,293
You summoned and here I am,
Your Majesty.

488
01:00:56,918 --> 01:00:58,668
Congratulations on Bundelkhand!

489
01:00:59,543 --> 01:01:03,793
I had this sword of Afghan iron
forged in your honour.

490
01:01:04,585 --> 01:01:05,960
I am honoured.

491
01:01:07,001 --> 01:01:12,460
My King, now permit me to use this sword
to bring Delhi to its knees before you.

492
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:15,043
This is not the right time to attack
Delhi, politically speaking -

493
01:01:15,043 --> 01:01:18,335
My instincts say now is the time,
your Majesty.

494
01:01:18,876 --> 01:01:21,126
Delhi is submerged
in a haze of debauchery.

495
01:01:21,293 --> 01:01:23,293
The Mughal emperor's
court has lost his faith.

496
01:01:23,293 --> 01:01:27,251
We have to appease the Nizam in the
South, to get to Delhi, in the north.

497
01:01:27,543 --> 01:01:29,335
There is such a thing
as political diplomacy.

498
01:01:32,001 --> 01:01:33,501
Minister has a point, Peshwa.

499
01:01:33,501 --> 01:01:35,918
That step must be taken
after much forethought.

500
01:01:36,210 --> 01:01:39,501
We shall discuss other matters
after this evening's soirée.

501
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:48,376
This sword is best
left in its sheath, Peshwa.

502
01:01:48,918 --> 01:01:51,918
Since you won't be going to Delhi,
what enemy's neck would you place it on?

503
01:01:54,168 --> 01:01:56,001
The Peshwa doesn't lack enemies.

504
01:01:56,001 --> 01:01:57,793
Don't move.

505
01:01:58,210 --> 01:02:00,335
Your neck is very valuable,..

506
01:02:00,335 --> 01:02:02,918
...and more delicate than
this string of pearls around it.

507
01:02:17,793 --> 01:02:20,001
As you already know...
Never doubt the cheetah's speed,..

508
01:02:20,001 --> 01:02:21,751
...the hawk's vision
and Bajirao's sword...

509
01:02:22,626 --> 01:02:23,960
They can outwit you any time.

510
01:02:38,501 --> 01:02:40,293
Why is Mastani Saheba here?

511
01:02:40,585 --> 01:02:43,501
Your mother has sent her
as tonight's entertainment.

512
01:02:50,543 --> 01:02:51,876
Let the entertainment begin.

513
01:02:59,835 --> 01:03:02,543
You are a court dancer,
here to entertain.

514
01:03:02,543 --> 01:03:04,376
Instead you are
dishonouring the court.

515
01:03:04,876 --> 01:03:07,376
I am not dishonouring the court,
but upholding my own honour.

516
01:03:07,751 --> 01:03:08,460
Who are you?

517
01:03:10,501 --> 01:03:11,293
Mastani.

518
01:03:11,293 --> 01:03:13,251
She is a gift from Bundelkhand.

519
01:03:14,126 --> 01:03:17,626
She lit up the Peshwa's palace
with her performance during New Year.

520
01:03:17,626 --> 01:03:19,418
That was a valid occasion...

521
01:03:19,876 --> 01:03:21,251
This is but a soirée.

522
01:03:21,585 --> 01:03:24,376
She is no court dancer but King..

523
01:03:24,376 --> 01:03:26,418
...Chatrasaal's daughter
and a guest of the Peshwa realm.

524
01:03:27,085 --> 01:03:29,668
A rather special guest, it appears.

525
01:03:29,876 --> 01:03:31,418
Yes she is, Minister!

526
01:03:31,418 --> 01:03:33,585
Thanks to her the Peshwa is alive..

527
01:03:33,585 --> 01:03:36,585
...and thanks to the Peshwa
the Maratha realm is alive!

528
01:03:38,293 --> 01:03:39,335
Your Majesty...

529
01:03:40,460 --> 01:03:43,043
She does not belong in this court.
Allow her to leave.

530
01:03:43,668 --> 01:03:44,960
The Peshwa is right.

531
01:03:45,376 --> 01:03:47,001
You have saved his life...

532
01:03:48,001 --> 01:03:49,585
How can I repay you?

533
01:03:50,001 --> 01:03:52,960
You will not be able to
fulfill my wish, Your Majesty.

534
01:03:53,418 --> 01:03:55,501
What wish is this,
that a king cannot fulfill?

535
01:03:57,710 --> 01:03:59,835
The Peshwa!

536
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:12,293
I salute your courage in asking for
what the Maratha kingdom values most.

537
01:04:13,001 --> 01:04:16,543
But you could be
punished for this demand.

538
01:04:18,668 --> 01:04:25,085
I lay my life, at the sword of thee.
If love is a crime, punish me!

539
01:04:27,001 --> 01:04:34,501
And yet, if thee hold me wrong,
Erase my name like an untold song.

540
01:04:35,168 --> 01:04:36,418
Well spoken!

541
01:04:38,043 --> 01:04:39,751
You may leave, Mastani.

542
01:05:00,293 --> 01:05:03,210
Don't anchor the boat,
I need to cross the river!

543
01:05:03,210 --> 01:05:05,793
My Lord, the water levels
have risen alarmingly.

544
01:05:05,793 --> 01:05:09,960
I'd have to bear huge losses in taking
the boat out in this weather!!

545
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:15,960
That should suffice.

546
01:05:42,793 --> 01:05:46,418
Looks like the storm won't abate,
My Lady. Let's return to Bundelkhand.

547
01:05:46,418 --> 01:05:48,460
Our coming here has been in vain.

548
01:05:48,460 --> 01:05:50,710
In Pune, they kept
us amongst courtesans...

549
01:05:50,918 --> 01:05:56,043
And here in the capital,
across the river, amongst these ruins!

550
01:05:56,876 --> 01:05:58,418
It frightens me to think...

551
01:05:58,418 --> 01:06:02,085
The man whose dagger you wed
is unaware of this tradition.

552
01:06:02,835 --> 01:06:06,168
What if he refuses to
accept your relationship?

553
01:06:08,418 --> 01:06:10,043
Let me test the power of my love.

554
01:06:10,335 --> 01:06:13,001
You needn't... Anymore!

555
01:06:13,001 --> 01:06:15,418
You had demanded the Peshwa
before the whole court...

556
01:06:16,001 --> 01:06:17,876
Here he is!

557
01:06:22,626 --> 01:06:25,001
I must say...

558
01:06:25,001 --> 01:06:29,251
You have sacrificed everything
over a marriage I was not even aware of!

559
01:06:30,126 --> 01:06:32,043
What justifies this madness?

560
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:33,960
Love...

561
01:06:35,501 --> 01:06:38,876
That battles stormy waters.

562
01:06:40,126 --> 01:06:43,668
Love, that bows down before no one.

563
01:06:44,460 --> 01:06:48,251
Love, that worships
its beloved above all else.

564
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:54,293
This society will never accept you!

565
01:06:54,293 --> 01:06:57,835
Loving me will be like
walking on hot embers.

566
01:06:58,751 --> 01:06:59,835
I accept.

567
01:06:59,835 --> 01:07:02,085
My wife's name is Kashi.

568
01:07:02,751 --> 01:07:05,126
She will always be my first wife.

569
01:07:05,126 --> 01:07:07,293
I can never belong only to you.

570
01:07:08,626 --> 01:07:10,543
I accept.

571
01:07:10,543 --> 01:07:14,793
Insisting on adding my name to yours
will bring you nothing but shame.

572
01:07:15,668 --> 01:07:17,168
I accept.

573
01:07:25,001 --> 01:07:30,751
By the fire of the earth, the sky and
my being, I take you to be my wife.

574
01:07:31,543 --> 01:07:34,793
Even if this society shuns us,
the world will always remember us as one...

575
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:38,043
Bajirao Mastani

576
01:07:55,793 --> 01:07:58,793
Mapping out your
meeting with the Nizam?

577
01:08:00,335 --> 01:08:02,960
Ensure you wear this when you go.

578
01:08:04,668 --> 01:08:08,043
Bajirao, this ring has cost us dearly.

579
01:08:08,710 --> 01:08:10,585
We have paid for it twice.

580
01:08:11,293 --> 01:08:15,585
First to the jeweller
and then to the boatman.

581
01:08:29,001 --> 01:08:34,960
My Lord, the snake seems
prepared to strike us.

582
01:08:35,460 --> 01:08:38,085
The Nizam comes with
twenty-thousand soldiers.

583
01:08:38,376 --> 01:08:40,335
We are heavily outnumbered.

584
01:08:40,335 --> 01:08:43,376
But he doesn't know that.

585
01:08:45,293 --> 01:08:49,376
Not all battles are
fought with weapons...

586
01:08:49,876 --> 01:08:54,001
Sometimes a sharp mind is enough.

587
01:09:04,085 --> 01:09:06,126
Welcome, King Bajirao!

588
01:09:06,126 --> 01:09:08,418
Have a seat!

589
01:09:08,793 --> 01:09:09,793
Namaste!

590
01:09:10,585 --> 01:09:15,543
You mistake me for royalty when I am
but a humble servant to King Shahu.

591
01:09:15,876 --> 01:09:20,335
Perhaps... But it is well known,
you are the mind that runs the empire.

592
01:09:21,043 --> 01:09:23,376
Some sherbet?

593
01:09:23,585 --> 01:09:24,626
Thank you.

594
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:27,085
I am more interested
in your sweet talk.

595
01:09:27,085 --> 01:09:31,418
I often tell people that
in the Maratha empire...

596
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:35,001
After the great King
Shivaji and King Shambhu...

597
01:09:35,001 --> 01:09:39,585
There is only Bajirao...
Rest are all fools!

598
01:09:39,751 --> 01:09:44,501
I'm also of the opinion that Nizam is
the strongest in all of South...

599
01:09:45,001 --> 01:09:46,876
Rest are all weak and meek!

600
01:09:46,876 --> 01:09:52,751
I'm impressed...
Your tongue is as sharp as your sword.

601
01:09:52,918 --> 01:09:54,960
And your intentions
are as shrewd as your eyes.

602
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:58,085
My intention is to capture you.

603
01:09:58,085 --> 01:10:00,668
Even the youngest
child in Pune knows that.

604
01:10:00,668 --> 01:10:02,793
Yet here you are a willing hostage.

605
01:10:02,793 --> 01:10:08,001
I am under oath to retaliate if
you breach the terms of this meeting.

606
01:10:08,001 --> 01:10:12,418
Are you threatening
me under my own roof?

607
01:10:12,418 --> 01:10:14,335
Cautioning, not threatening...

608
01:10:14,335 --> 01:10:17,293
One wrong turn
and your kingdom will burn.

609
01:10:19,043 --> 01:10:20,376
Arrest him!

610
01:10:23,001 --> 01:10:26,251
I said, arrest him!

611
01:10:26,876 --> 01:10:29,960
I'm amazed you would order my
own men to capture me!

612
01:10:30,585 --> 01:10:32,918
The men you sent to escort me here
preferred our living quarters.

613
01:10:32,918 --> 01:10:35,543
They decided to stay back.

614
01:10:35,543 --> 01:10:37,126
Peshwa, do not forget...

615
01:10:37,126 --> 01:10:39,751
That your army of 20,000 men...

616
01:10:40,918 --> 01:10:43,335
Horses and elephants,
stands guard outside.

617
01:10:43,335 --> 01:10:49,001
But what you do not know is that
40,000 Maratha soldiers stand behind them...

618
01:10:49,001 --> 01:10:51,668
Awaiting my signal
to decimate you.

619
01:10:54,210 --> 01:10:55,793
What do you want?

620
01:11:01,501 --> 01:11:02,710
All of India.

621
01:11:07,126 --> 01:11:08,335
But for now, your silence.

622
01:11:08,335 --> 01:11:11,460
When I march on Delhi,
you will not utter a word.

623
01:11:13,001 --> 01:11:13,876
I accept.

624
01:11:13,876 --> 01:11:14,751
Secondly...

625
01:11:15,501 --> 01:11:19,585
...You shall return all captured
Maratha estates to our King.

626
01:11:19,918 --> 01:11:20,876
I accept.

627
01:11:20,876 --> 01:11:22,293
And thirdly...

628
01:11:28,085 --> 01:11:29,960
When I welcome you with open arms,..

629
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:32,501
...you shall forget past animosity
and accept my friendship.

630
01:11:32,501 --> 01:11:33,585
Here!

631
01:12:09,335 --> 01:12:12,793
Let the drums roll...

632
01:12:12,793 --> 01:12:15,668
Victory is ours!

633
01:12:15,668 --> 01:12:18,710
"We unbeatable warriors..."

634
01:12:18,710 --> 01:12:22,085
Have crushed the enemy!

635
01:13:31,001 --> 01:13:36,876
The sparks of victory are ablaze.

636
01:13:37,210 --> 01:13:43,126
Our hearts are overflowing with pride.

637
01:13:43,126 --> 01:13:49,626
Even the night sky
is full of rainbows!

638
01:14:17,918 --> 01:14:21,751
Our camp is bursting with energy!

639
01:14:24,168 --> 01:14:28,168
Our celebration knows no bounds.

640
01:14:29,918 --> 01:14:31,418
This victory...

641
01:14:31,418 --> 01:14:32,960
Our victory...

642
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:36,418
This victory of ours is like no other!

643
01:15:25,876 --> 01:15:28,168
Mother!

644
01:15:29,126 --> 01:15:31,668
Bajirao's message!

645
01:15:31,668 --> 01:15:33,960
What does it say, Chimaji?

646
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:36,626
His meeting with the Nizam...

647
01:15:37,293 --> 01:15:38,918
...was successful!

648
01:15:39,751 --> 01:15:43,585
Praise the Lord!

649
01:15:46,668 --> 01:15:50,001
Stop crying, Kashi!

650
01:15:50,835 --> 01:15:54,876
My son has not seen defeat
since she walked into this house.

651
01:15:55,168 --> 01:15:57,793
Your unborn child is destined for
great things too, Kashi.

652
01:15:57,793 --> 01:16:01,918
Mother, there should be a feast
for the Brahmins to celebrate!

653
01:16:01,918 --> 01:16:02,918
Agreed.

654
01:16:03,210 --> 01:16:06,168
Send out an invitation
to Krishna Bhatt...

655
01:16:06,168 --> 01:16:09,751
That we shall host
the Brahmins this afternoon.

656
01:16:10,793 --> 01:16:11,668
Start the preparations!

657
01:16:14,335 --> 01:16:15,668
Chimaji...

658
01:16:16,376 --> 01:16:18,710
Send a message to Mastani as well.

659
01:16:30,335 --> 01:16:34,460
Eid Mubarak in this new house,
My Lady! Where is my gift?

660
01:16:35,626 --> 01:16:36,835
What's there?

661
01:16:37,918 --> 01:16:39,960
I thought the Peshwa called my name.

662
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:42,376
How is that possible, My Lady!

663
01:16:42,376 --> 01:16:46,085
He will first go to Shaniwar Wada to
celebrate his victory over the Nizam.

664
01:16:48,335 --> 01:16:50,168
Mastani Saheba!

665
01:17:10,668 --> 01:17:12,168
What is this Bajirao!

666
01:17:12,335 --> 01:17:14,918
The power of your love Mastani!

667
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:17,710
I wish you on your victory.

668
01:17:17,710 --> 01:17:19,626
And I wish you a happy Eid.

669
01:17:38,876 --> 01:17:42,793
Your face is glowing Mastani.

670
01:17:44,751 --> 01:17:46,251
Because you have returned.

671
01:17:48,001 --> 01:17:51,835
It's like the glow in the sky,
just before sunrise...

672
01:17:52,918 --> 01:17:56,001
We'll have to think of a name for our
to-be born child!

673
01:18:09,376 --> 01:18:11,085
My Lady!

674
01:18:11,376 --> 01:18:14,376
There's a message for you
from the Peshwa's mother...

675
01:18:16,376 --> 01:18:17,376
What is it?

676
01:18:17,376 --> 01:18:20,876
There shall be a celebration tonight
in honour of the Peshwa's victory...

677
01:18:20,876 --> 01:18:24,918
On this occasion, Mastani is ordered
to present her dance...

678
01:18:39,793 --> 01:18:43,168
Your Ladyship, the food is sewed
and the Brahmins are waiting...

679
01:18:43,168 --> 01:18:44,501
Why is the Peshwa not here?

680
01:18:44,710 --> 01:18:47,001
He is on his way,
please begin the feast.

681
01:18:47,001 --> 01:18:49,210
But how can we begin without the host?

682
01:18:49,210 --> 01:18:50,543
My Lady!

683
01:18:51,376 --> 01:18:52,876
Did you send the message?

684
01:18:52,876 --> 01:18:54,668
Yes, but...

685
01:18:55,043 --> 01:18:56,210
But what?

686
01:18:56,210 --> 01:18:59,251
Mastani Saheba will no longer perform
as a court dancer.

687
01:19:00,001 --> 01:19:01,168
Says who?

688
01:19:01,168 --> 01:19:02,501
Mastani?

689
01:19:02,501 --> 01:19:05,043
No, My Lady... The Peshwa.

690
01:19:05,751 --> 01:19:08,918
He also said that he shall return
after the Eid feast...

691
01:19:08,918 --> 01:19:11,293
You need not wait for him.

692
01:19:11,626 --> 01:19:14,460
Dear God...

693
01:19:14,460 --> 01:19:15,793
Krishnaji...

694
01:19:16,168 --> 01:19:18,126
We cannot eat in this house anymore!!

695
01:19:18,710 --> 01:19:22,001
Krishna Bhatt, you disrespect
the Peshwa by doing so!

696
01:19:22,001 --> 01:19:25,126
And hasn't the Peshwa disrespected us?

697
01:19:25,876 --> 01:19:28,376
Charity is doled
out at mosques as well.

698
01:19:28,376 --> 01:19:30,960
Let's go!

699
01:19:45,043 --> 01:19:46,293
Welcome home, Bajirao.

700
01:19:46,793 --> 01:19:48,710
Congratulations on
your win over the Nizam.

701
01:19:48,710 --> 01:19:49,793
I wish you the same.

702
01:19:50,168 --> 01:19:51,460
Live long!

703
01:19:51,793 --> 01:19:53,918
Forgive me, I am late.

704
01:19:53,918 --> 01:19:57,918
While you were celebrating
Eid at Kothrud Palace...

705
01:19:58,168 --> 01:20:00,126
The brahmins left
without eating a morsel.

706
01:20:00,126 --> 01:20:02,876
Never mind, we can invite them back
tomorrow and celebrate twice over.

707
01:20:03,335 --> 01:20:04,710
Why twice?

708
01:20:06,001 --> 01:20:08,043
Mastani is about to become
the mother of my child.

709
01:20:10,918 --> 01:20:16,085
If the Brahmins walked out because
you chose to celebrate Eid with her...

710
01:20:16,751 --> 01:20:19,168
What'll they do when
this news gets out, Bajirao?

711
01:20:19,168 --> 01:20:20,001
Mother...

712
01:20:20,001 --> 01:20:21,543
Don't interrupt me!

713
01:20:25,585 --> 01:20:31,251
I suggest, we don't tell Kashi.

714
01:20:33,585 --> 01:20:36,918
What is there to hide mother?

715
01:20:36,918 --> 01:20:41,001
The truth is, what it is!

716
01:20:52,293 --> 01:20:53,960
Kashi...

717
01:20:55,460 --> 01:20:58,918
I have been looking
for you all over and here you are.

718
01:20:59,668 --> 01:21:01,543
I was looking at the moon...

719
01:21:10,335 --> 01:21:11,918
I want to tell you
something important.

720
01:21:11,918 --> 01:21:14,960
That you have already eaten.

721
01:21:16,460 --> 01:21:17,710
Here's your paan.

722
01:21:17,710 --> 01:21:19,293
No, that's not it.

723
01:21:20,418 --> 01:21:21,585
Kashi, there's someone else...

724
01:21:21,585 --> 01:21:24,001
So the rumours are true.

725
01:21:24,001 --> 01:21:24,960
What rumours?

726
01:21:25,668 --> 01:21:28,168
That the Peshwa's caught the evil eye.

727
01:21:28,335 --> 01:21:32,376
Never mind the rumours...
I don't believe in superstitions.

728
01:21:32,376 --> 01:21:33,668
But I do...

729
01:21:34,126 --> 01:21:35,418
Here...

730
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:56,543
Dear Mastani...

731
01:22:56,543 --> 01:23:02,126
Fighting in the battlefield is far easier than
fighting to keep your relationships intact.

732
01:23:02,751 --> 01:23:07,585
My heart wishes to be with you
every single moment.

733
01:23:08,335 --> 01:23:13,335
But I cannot meet you till I, myself,
don't inform Kashi of our relationship.

734
01:23:13,876 --> 01:23:19,001
Kashi is not just my first wife...
She is my friend and confidant too.

735
01:23:19,585 --> 01:23:23,085
Until then,
please take care of yourself.

736
01:23:47,543 --> 01:23:49,085
Jhumri...

737
01:23:50,710 --> 01:23:52,751
My Lady!

738
01:23:55,001 --> 01:23:56,460
What news have you brought,
Veer Singh?

739
01:23:56,460 --> 01:23:58,335
I couldn't deliver your message to
the Peshwa even today...

740
01:23:58,793 --> 01:24:01,918
News is that he is very ill and
unable to meet anyone.

741
01:24:03,710 --> 01:24:06,126
Get the palanquin ready.
I shall go to meet him right away.

742
01:24:06,126 --> 01:24:07,501
This news could be false, My Lady...

743
01:24:07,501 --> 01:24:08,668
It could be true!

744
01:24:08,668 --> 01:24:12,085
Going to Shaniwar Wada at this hour
could be dangerous for you.

745
01:24:25,835 --> 01:24:26,960
Mahipat Rao...

746
01:24:27,335 --> 01:24:28,710
Veer Singh, what are you doing here?

747
01:24:28,710 --> 01:24:31,626
Mastani Saheba is
here to meet the Peshwa.

748
01:24:31,626 --> 01:24:32,418
He is in his office.

749
01:24:32,418 --> 01:24:33,460
Who is there?

750
01:24:34,376 --> 01:24:36,126
Ambaji Panth's daughter-in-law.

751
01:24:46,751 --> 01:24:47,960
Shalubai!

752
01:24:49,543 --> 01:24:50,668
Shalubai!

753
01:24:50,668 --> 01:24:51,626
Yes.

754
01:24:51,626 --> 01:24:54,418
See who that is.

755
01:24:54,418 --> 01:24:55,585
Yes.

756
01:25:03,793 --> 01:25:05,960
Shalubai... Who is it?

757
01:25:06,293 --> 01:25:08,543
It is Ambaji Panth's daughter-in-law.

758
01:25:08,543 --> 01:25:11,960
So where is Gopikabai's palanquin...
They had left together.

759
01:25:11,960 --> 01:25:12,876
Shall I find out?

760
01:25:12,876 --> 01:25:15,168
No, I'll go myself.

761
01:25:20,626 --> 01:25:24,168
Mastani Saheba, please
wait at the Palace of Mirrors...

762
01:25:24,335 --> 01:25:25,501
I shall inform the Peshwa.

763
01:25:59,418 --> 01:26:02,335
Mastani, what brings
you here at this hour?

764
01:26:09,501 --> 01:26:10,293
Bajirao.

765
01:26:10,293 --> 01:26:14,001
You shouldn't have risked your life
by coming here.

766
01:26:14,001 --> 01:26:17,210
There's no bigger risk to my life
than spending a moment without you.

767
01:26:17,210 --> 01:26:19,460
You never got my letter...

768
01:26:25,001 --> 01:26:28,043
These fort walls have
become too high to scale.

769
01:26:28,043 --> 01:26:29,793
Yet here you are, Mastani.

770
01:26:31,085 --> 01:26:34,585
It's true that nothing can come in
the way of love.

771
01:28:15,001 --> 01:28:17,168
Lady Kashi's palanquin is here...

772
01:28:17,168 --> 01:28:21,043
Has the crib reached her quarters?

773
01:28:21,043 --> 01:28:24,126
Dear God! It slipped my mind!
I'll check right away.

774
01:28:24,126 --> 01:28:27,751
The Peshwa must be
arriving any minute now!

775
01:28:29,043 --> 01:28:30,543
My Lady...

776
01:28:31,085 --> 01:28:34,293
I stand to welcome
you like you always do...

777
01:28:35,376 --> 01:28:37,085
You have brought back
light to this lifeless..

778
01:28:37,085 --> 01:28:39,126
...palace by returning
from your maternal home.

779
01:28:41,001 --> 01:28:43,418
Let me see our youngest warrior!

780
01:28:53,376 --> 01:28:55,085
N's a boy!

781
01:28:55,293 --> 01:28:59,376
Here, Here!

782
01:28:59,710 --> 01:29:01,168
Strong lad!

783
01:29:02,335 --> 01:29:05,335
You will be a warrior
even greater than Bajirao.

784
01:29:05,793 --> 01:29:09,001
You have your mother's beautiful eyes...

785
01:29:18,710 --> 01:29:19,418
Stop!

786
01:29:19,418 --> 01:29:20,210
Let me in!

787
01:29:20,210 --> 01:29:21,376
You cannot!

788
01:29:21,376 --> 01:29:23,626
I must meet My Lord!

789
01:29:23,626 --> 01:29:25,460
It is not possible at this hour.

790
01:29:25,460 --> 01:29:27,335
My Lord!

791
01:29:31,501 --> 01:29:34,251
Make haste My Lord,
Mastani Saheba is in great pain.

792
01:29:34,251 --> 01:29:36,126
No midwife or doctor
is willing to attend to her.

793
01:29:36,335 --> 01:29:37,168
What if-

794
01:29:37,168 --> 01:29:38,501
She will be fine.

795
01:29:39,585 --> 01:29:46,751
A tigress needs no
doctors or midwives...

796
01:29:49,085 --> 01:29:51,085
Isn't it Chimaji?

797
01:30:09,626 --> 01:30:14,418
My Lady is truly suffering, Sir...
And no one is ready to help!

798
01:30:25,793 --> 01:30:29,168
Mastani, breathe...

799
01:30:32,376 --> 01:30:34,751
Giving birth to a
warrior is never easy.

800
01:31:02,376 --> 01:31:03,710
Look!

801
01:31:04,835 --> 01:31:05,835
Krishna

802
01:31:06,876 --> 01:31:08,001
Krishna

803
01:31:11,876 --> 01:31:13,210
Krishna

804
01:31:15,001 --> 01:31:16,793
Upon my return from the north,..

805
01:31:16,793 --> 01:31:19,085
...I'll organise a naming
ceremony for both my sons.

806
01:31:44,126 --> 01:31:47,168
Don't toy with our patience anymore...

807
01:31:47,168 --> 01:31:51,793
Aunt Bhiu,
tell us what name you have chosen.

808
01:31:51,960 --> 01:31:53,418
Tell us.

809
01:31:58,168 --> 01:32:00,585
Well, what will it be?

810
01:32:00,585 --> 01:32:01,543
Raghunath!

811
01:32:02,585 --> 01:32:03,543
Raghunath!

812
01:32:07,168 --> 01:32:10,418
When Bajirao is back, he will be happy
to hear the name.

813
01:32:14,293 --> 01:32:16,085
My Raghoba.

814
01:32:16,085 --> 01:32:18,293
What a lovely name, My Lady.

815
01:32:22,835 --> 01:32:24,293
Welcome, Mastani.

816
01:32:29,543 --> 01:32:30,668
Welcome!

817
01:32:30,668 --> 01:32:33,043
You have come at an opportune moment.

818
01:32:35,043 --> 01:32:38,418
Glad you could come.

819
01:32:39,501 --> 01:32:40,501
Mother...

820
01:32:41,293 --> 01:32:44,335
How can someone lose all shame..

821
01:32:44,335 --> 01:32:46,501
...and keep returning to
your doorstep to be insulted?

822
01:32:46,835 --> 01:32:48,751
What offence can come
at your own doorstep?

823
01:32:50,501 --> 01:32:52,460
No insult can come by your own people.

824
01:32:53,710 --> 01:32:55,793
I am here to bless Bajirao's child.

825
01:32:55,793 --> 01:32:58,626
Are you here to bless relations
or to beg acceptance?

826
01:32:59,376 --> 01:33:02,418
I am here with gifts on
Bajirao's behalf in his absence.

827
01:33:02,418 --> 01:33:05,376
If you had to please
your way into our family...

828
01:33:05,376 --> 01:33:10,668
Then you should've got saffron clothes
and not this green coloured poison.

829
01:33:11,001 --> 01:33:15,001
People have associated each religion
with color, but color has no religion...

830
01:33:15,418 --> 01:33:20,210
It is when the heart turns black that
you start differentiating on such grounds.

831
01:33:20,418 --> 01:33:21,835
Leave it, Chimaji...

832
01:33:21,835 --> 01:33:23,210
She has forgotten the difference..

833
01:33:23,210 --> 01:33:25,460
...between durga(a Hindu goddess)
and dargah(Muslim shrine).

834
01:33:25,460 --> 01:33:32,460
Perhaps you forget that idols in
temples are often adorned in green...

835
01:33:33,168 --> 01:33:36,960
And saffron sheets
cover the purest Sufi tombs.

836
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:38,960
Where is the thought
of color and religion then?

837
01:33:41,418 --> 01:33:45,918
Bajirao merely holds your hand and
your tongue begins to cut like a sword.

838
01:33:46,460 --> 01:33:51,918
A warrior's instinct is to reach for her
sword even when struck by a pebble.

839
01:33:52,501 --> 01:33:53,460
Krishna Bhatt...

840
01:33:53,835 --> 01:33:58,001
This year when we pray for the
deceased, add a prayer for her too...

841
01:33:58,376 --> 01:34:00,918
So that she is dead for us.

842
01:34:01,501 --> 01:34:02,501
Leave us now!

843
01:34:02,918 --> 01:34:05,960
Those prayers are not for strangers,
Mother...

844
01:34:06,793 --> 01:34:09,793
I'm grateful you thought
of me as your own.

845
01:34:51,210 --> 01:34:52,793
Welcome!

846
01:34:53,543 --> 01:34:58,001
I want you to organise
my son's naming ceremony.

847
01:34:58,501 --> 01:35:01,543
That's already been done, My Lord.
He has a blessed birth chart.

848
01:35:01,710 --> 01:35:04,501
No, not Raghunath... I am
talking about my other son, Krishna.

849
01:35:04,501 --> 01:35:05,710
He is my son too.

850
01:35:05,710 --> 01:35:07,418
My Lord,
traditions do not permit that.

851
01:35:07,960 --> 01:35:09,168
Why?

852
01:35:10,293 --> 01:35:13,460
As per our tradition, a son
inherits his father's religion...

853
01:35:13,460 --> 01:35:14,585
Isn't that right?

854
01:35:14,793 --> 01:35:17,376
How can you be wrong, My Lord.

855
01:35:17,585 --> 01:35:21,001
But it is imperative for
the child's parents to be...

856
01:35:21,001 --> 01:35:22,751
married under the Hindu law.

857
01:35:23,293 --> 01:35:27,126
I shall marry Mastani
as per the Hindu law.

858
01:35:27,126 --> 01:35:28,626
Begin the preparations.

859
01:35:29,293 --> 01:35:31,043
I'm afraid it still won't be possible.

860
01:35:31,043 --> 01:35:31,751
Why not?

861
01:35:31,918 --> 01:35:35,751
Krishna was born out of wedlock
and he shall always remain...

862
01:35:36,043 --> 01:35:37,251
illegitimate!

863
01:35:37,251 --> 01:35:38,210
Am I right?

864
01:35:38,210 --> 01:35:39,460
Yes, yes...

865
01:35:39,460 --> 01:35:41,543
Your thinking is illegitimate,
Krishna Bhatt.

866
01:35:43,043 --> 01:35:47,668
Religion is bigger than anything,
My Lord... Even you!

867
01:35:47,668 --> 01:35:51,001
We cannot be a part of such blasphemy!

868
01:35:51,001 --> 01:35:53,085
Your thoughts do not matter to me.

869
01:35:53,085 --> 01:35:56,210
If you cannot initiate
him into my faith...

870
01:35:56,460 --> 01:35:58,793
Then he shall follow his mother's.

871
01:35:59,668 --> 01:36:02,960
And from today he will not be
called Krishna, but Shamsher Bahadur!

872
01:36:04,418 --> 01:36:06,376
Leave.

873
01:36:12,376 --> 01:36:14,418
We need to speed up tax collections.

874
01:36:14,418 --> 01:36:16,168
Send a message to the collectors.

875
01:36:16,835 --> 01:36:18,876
Why are these sweets
being distributed?

876
01:36:19,418 --> 01:36:21,460
What is the occasion?

877
01:36:21,793 --> 01:36:23,043
Who are these from?

878
01:36:23,751 --> 01:36:24,960
These are from me.

879
01:36:25,918 --> 01:36:27,293
Please have.

880
01:36:27,293 --> 01:36:30,793
Chimaji, it's your favourite.

881
01:36:34,501 --> 01:36:36,126
What is the occasion, brother?

882
01:36:36,126 --> 01:36:39,668
I had a naming ceremony for Krishna
and changed his name.

883
01:36:40,043 --> 01:36:41,918
And what have you named him, My Lord?

884
01:36:42,543 --> 01:36:44,001
Shamsher Bahadur.

885
01:36:47,335 --> 01:36:49,918
The name of Peshwa's Muslim lineage.

886
01:36:55,793 --> 01:36:59,043
You all may leave.

887
01:37:01,501 --> 01:37:05,085
Panth, look at his face!

888
01:37:09,835 --> 01:37:10,918
Read it.

889
01:37:13,043 --> 01:37:17,543
The Peshwa decrees two estates to
be gifted to Mastani Bajirao Ballad.

890
01:37:19,793 --> 01:37:21,501
Impossible, Bajirao!

891
01:37:21,501 --> 01:37:23,168
We do not entertain such practices.

892
01:37:23,168 --> 01:37:24,960
From this day on, we shall.

893
01:37:26,501 --> 01:37:27,418
What say, Panth?

894
01:37:27,418 --> 01:37:29,960
I fail to understand, why does
she need estates when you are here?

895
01:37:29,960 --> 01:37:31,710
Don't you see, Panth?

896
01:37:32,543 --> 01:37:35,460
If they can throw her out of my house
while I'm alive...

897
01:37:35,460 --> 01:37:37,960
Imagine how they'd
treat her when I'm gone.

898
01:37:38,918 --> 01:37:42,501
You have to safeguard
the future of your loved ones.

899
01:37:42,501 --> 01:37:44,960
Today it's an estate, tomorrow you'll
gift her the entire Peshwa kingdom.

900
01:37:45,376 --> 01:37:47,376
You cannot gift away
territory at whim.

901
01:37:47,376 --> 01:37:50,460
But you can put up a woman
in a brothel at whim?

902
01:37:50,460 --> 01:37:51,418
That is my understanding.

903
01:37:51,418 --> 01:37:53,501
Make me understand as well.

904
01:37:53,835 --> 01:37:55,126
A dagger deserves a sheath...

905
01:37:55,501 --> 01:37:56,918
A wife deserves a home...

906
01:37:57,293 --> 01:37:59,126
<i>And</i> a <i>mistress deserves</i> a <i>hovel!</i>

907
01:38:11,293 --> 01:38:14,001
You missed your aim, My Lord.

908
01:38:16,376 --> 01:38:19,376
No... Our relationship came in the way.

909
01:38:19,376 --> 01:38:20,710
That's why I say...

910
01:38:21,210 --> 01:38:24,085
You must end all relations that
become a hindrance.

911
01:38:25,835 --> 01:38:28,251
Sometimes your relations
themselves finish you.

912
01:38:30,418 --> 01:38:34,251
Seal the orders!

913
01:38:39,418 --> 01:38:43,001
Bajirao fought with his brother today
in front of the entire court...

914
01:38:43,376 --> 01:38:48,543
stripping his relationship
of dignity, all for that mistress.

915
01:38:50,543 --> 01:38:52,043
It's wrong!

916
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:56,918
I do not understand right or
wrong anymore mother.

917
01:38:57,126 --> 01:39:01,418
I lived my entire
life as his shadow...

918
01:39:01,793 --> 01:39:04,793
And one day he just
walked into darkness...

919
01:39:05,918 --> 01:39:08,460
Not once thinking that
this shadow will fade away.

920
01:39:08,710 --> 01:39:11,793
No one can understand
your pain like me...

921
01:39:12,751 --> 01:39:16,210
The status of the lady of this house
may be as grand as a mango orchard...

922
01:39:17,751 --> 01:39:20,460
Whose fruit is longed for by all...

923
01:39:21,501 --> 01:39:24,585
But to acquire the fruit,
one must stone the trees...

924
01:39:25,751 --> 01:39:27,668
And that is the orchard's destiny.

925
01:39:31,085 --> 01:39:32,085
Kashi...

926
01:39:32,501 --> 01:39:37,168
We should've sewn the flag green,
to the mistress's liking!

927
01:39:55,960 --> 01:39:58,001
Oh Lord!

928
01:40:16,335 --> 01:40:25,043
(Chants)

929
01:40:28,460 --> 01:40:31,085
Come, Krishna Bhatt. Hello, Mother.

930
01:40:31,085 --> 01:40:32,501
How did you know, My Lord?

931
01:40:32,501 --> 01:40:35,043
A warrior must always be alert.

932
01:40:35,043 --> 01:40:37,043
Enemy can strike at any moment.

933
01:40:39,126 --> 01:40:41,501
Raghav, greet your grandmother.

934
01:40:42,460 --> 01:40:44,876
Shamsher, you too.

935
01:40:45,126 --> 01:40:50,251
Krishna Bhatt wanted to know, when you
will perform the repentance prayers.

936
01:40:50,418 --> 01:40:51,501
Repentance?

937
01:40:51,710 --> 01:40:53,501
You used to perform it every year...

938
01:40:53,501 --> 01:40:57,085
For the gratification of martyrs' souls.

939
01:40:57,085 --> 01:40:58,960
You haven't performed it in two years.

940
01:40:58,960 --> 01:41:01,501
Yes, and it won't happen again.

941
01:41:02,168 --> 01:41:03,918
You are refusing it being a brahmin?

942
01:41:04,168 --> 01:41:07,043
I am brahmin only by birth,
but a warrior by destiny.

943
01:41:07,293 --> 01:41:10,543
This ritual is mandatory
for the purification of our soul.

944
01:41:12,376 --> 01:41:15,918
Alright, let's purify our souls...

945
01:41:17,085 --> 01:41:21,543
I shall bring Mastani to Shaniwar Wada
and give her the rights of being my wife...

946
01:41:22,293 --> 01:41:24,293
That can be my only atonement.

947
01:41:25,960 --> 01:41:28,460
I am proud to have a son like you...

948
01:41:29,668 --> 01:41:31,918
Who knows how to respect a woman...

949
01:41:32,626 --> 01:41:34,918
But what you ask for is impossible.

950
01:41:35,793 --> 01:41:37,210
Never, my son!

951
01:41:39,251 --> 01:41:41,043
On Saptami (auspicious day)...

952
01:41:42,251 --> 01:41:44,460
I shall bring Mastani
to Shaniwar Wada.

953
01:41:44,460 --> 01:41:50,126
The Brahmins shall ostracize the entire
Peshwa clan if that were to happen.

954
01:42:24,460 --> 01:42:25,876
Welcome home...

955
01:42:28,501 --> 01:42:31,376
It shall be known
to all as Mastani Mahal.

956
01:42:36,210 --> 01:42:37,418
Panth...

957
01:42:39,460 --> 01:42:40,585
Brother...

958
01:42:41,960 --> 01:42:43,126
Chimaji...

959
01:42:52,543 --> 01:42:55,168
Everyone seems to be welcoming you
with their absence!

960
01:43:08,668 --> 01:43:11,335
Chimaji and Ambaji have
gone out to inspect lands.

961
01:43:12,043 --> 01:43:13,751
Mother has gone on a pilgrimage.

962
01:43:14,126 --> 01:43:16,460
So as the lady of this house...

963
01:43:17,543 --> 01:43:22,335
I welcome you and your guest.

964
01:43:25,793 --> 01:43:27,043
Come.

965
01:43:42,626 --> 01:43:45,710
Don't touch my feet! (A Hindu
tradition of giving blessings)

966
01:43:53,835 --> 01:43:56,001
Thank you for keeping my honour,
My Lady.

967
01:43:57,460 --> 01:43:59,210
It lightens my mind.

968
01:44:00,460 --> 01:44:02,960
Don't forget My Lord...

969
01:44:04,460 --> 01:44:09,376
This welcome stops at the threshold,
it doesn't extend to the heart.

970
01:44:41,710 --> 01:44:44,085
Nana! When did you arrive?

971
01:44:46,126 --> 01:44:50,335
You didn't write or send
a message from the capital.

972
01:44:50,835 --> 01:44:53,835
Had I known you were coming,
I would've welcomed you in style.

973
01:44:53,835 --> 01:44:54,418
Namaste.

974
01:44:54,418 --> 01:44:55,918
Stay blessed!

975
01:44:58,293 --> 01:44:59,668
You've grown so tall.

976
01:45:00,210 --> 01:45:02,626
Your moustache has started showing too.

977
01:45:03,126 --> 01:45:06,918
I hope you are learning
politics from the king.

978
01:45:07,085 --> 01:45:07,876
Yes.

979
01:45:08,126 --> 01:45:11,335
I wish you learnt some
politics as well, Mother.

980
01:45:11,335 --> 01:45:12,418
Meaning?

981
01:45:13,501 --> 01:45:18,293
The man for whom you hold this flame,
doesn't deserve it.

982
01:45:18,293 --> 01:45:19,376
What have you done?

983
01:45:21,668 --> 01:45:23,251
What did you do, Nana?

984
01:45:24,710 --> 01:45:26,626
Do you know who you are talking about?

985
01:45:26,918 --> 01:45:28,210
Yes, Mother.

986
01:45:28,835 --> 01:45:31,668
The man who is the talk of every town
from Pune to the capital...

987
01:45:32,335 --> 01:45:35,293
For burning his own home
with Bundelkhand's torch.

988
01:45:35,751 --> 01:45:38,460
Yet you sit here praying for him!

989
01:45:38,835 --> 01:45:40,210
Nana!

990
01:45:50,501 --> 01:45:53,335
Don't worry about me so much, my son.

991
01:46:15,668 --> 01:46:16,710
My Lady!

992
01:46:17,418 --> 01:46:20,168
Shiva Bhatt, you startled me!

993
01:46:20,460 --> 01:46:21,501
The prayers are about to start

994
01:46:21,501 --> 01:46:23,501
My Lady, a grave disaster
is about to happen tonight.

995
01:46:24,293 --> 01:46:25,126
What disaster?

996
01:46:25,585 --> 01:46:28,043
While we pray,
Mastani Mahal will be attacked.

997
01:46:28,376 --> 01:46:32,418
She will be murdered.
Please save her if you can!

998
01:46:41,918 --> 01:46:55,043
Hail Lord Ganesha
(Hindu God of obstacles).

999
01:50:56,376 --> 01:50:59,168
How shall you atone for this crime,
Krishna Bhatt?

1000
01:50:59,168 --> 01:51:03,710
What proof exists that Krishna Bhatt
has murdered Shiva Bhatt?

1001
01:51:04,210 --> 01:51:05,251
Mother...

1002
01:51:06,543 --> 01:51:08,043
How shall you atone for this crime?

1003
01:51:08,043 --> 01:51:10,501
What atonement, what punishment?

1004
01:51:10,501 --> 01:51:13,710
Whoever opposes religion
will meet such an end.

1005
01:51:14,126 --> 01:51:18,960
It was your mistress's good fortune, else
she would've been cut to pieces as well.

1006
01:52:05,085 --> 01:52:07,460
My Lord, your mother is here.

1007
01:52:08,168 --> 01:52:12,543
Why have we been summoned like
criminals, despite sharing the same roof?

1008
01:52:12,835 --> 01:52:17,418
When walls come up between hearts,
they no longer hold a house together.

1009
01:52:17,918 --> 01:52:19,668
Yes, we get it!

1010
01:52:20,043 --> 01:52:21,960
Why have you summoned us?
What's our crime?

1011
01:52:21,960 --> 01:52:24,043
Krishna Bhatt!

1012
01:52:27,293 --> 01:52:30,543
Protecting a criminal is your crime.

1013
01:52:30,543 --> 01:52:32,793
How dare you talk
to mother in this manner!

1014
01:52:32,793 --> 01:52:34,085
And you?

1015
01:52:36,043 --> 01:52:37,918
How dare you talk to
the Peshwa in this manner.

1016
01:52:37,918 --> 01:52:38,668
My Lord!

1017
01:52:38,668 --> 01:52:42,085
Remind him,
I won't miss my aim every time.

1018
01:52:42,085 --> 01:52:43,251
Bajirao, this isn't you...

1019
01:52:44,168 --> 01:52:46,710
But the influence of Bundelkhand's
gift. She has gotten to your head.

1020
01:52:48,376 --> 01:52:50,751
Bundelkhand's gifts
are on your head too...

1021
01:52:51,418 --> 01:52:57,085
These jewels on your head, around your
neck; are all Bundelkhand's gifts...

1022
01:52:57,085 --> 01:52:58,960
You can't accept these gifts?

1023
01:53:00,501 --> 01:53:02,501
Then take them off!

1024
01:53:13,668 --> 01:53:16,460
Bundelkhand's gifts are accepted,
not their daughter.

1025
01:53:17,293 --> 01:53:20,043
Mastani as my mistress is accepted,
not as my wife...

1026
01:53:21,293 --> 01:53:25,710
But remember mother, Bajirao's
love for Mastani is unconditional.

1027
01:53:27,501 --> 01:53:30,501
Where do you find such
hatred for her, mother?

1028
01:53:30,710 --> 01:53:35,918
Peshwa blood cannot be adulterated by
an outsider, it's that simple!

1029
01:53:36,210 --> 01:53:37,918
That's been done... Now?

1030
01:53:37,918 --> 01:53:39,085
That's what!

1031
01:53:39,501 --> 01:53:43,543
You fight Muslims and yet
fell in love with one of them?

1032
01:53:43,543 --> 01:53:47,210
I fight the Mughal dynasty,
not their religion.

1033
01:53:47,751 --> 01:53:50,001
I ask you one last time...

1034
01:53:50,626 --> 01:53:57,335
Bajirao shall remain Peshwa
only if Mastani is accepted...

1035
01:53:58,293 --> 01:53:59,501
Agreed?

1036
01:54:01,335 --> 01:54:02,460
No.

1037
01:54:25,710 --> 01:54:26,960
It's yours!

1038
01:54:28,960 --> 01:54:30,043
Bajirao

1039
01:54:55,001 --> 01:54:56,085
Kashi!

1040
01:54:56,543 --> 01:55:02,293
I've been looking for you all over.
I've wished everyone except you.

1041
01:55:03,460 --> 01:55:05,210
Where are you going?

1042
01:55:05,501 --> 01:55:06,710
I'll be back soon.

1043
01:55:07,251 --> 01:55:08,793
But where are you going?

1044
01:55:09,626 --> 01:55:10,918
Mastani Mahal

1045
01:55:29,585 --> 01:55:31,626
I'm happy to see you, sister.

1046
01:55:31,626 --> 01:55:34,668
My Lady'... Not sister.

1047
01:55:35,918 --> 01:55:38,001
I'm the Peshwa's legally wedded wife.

1048
01:55:38,960 --> 01:55:41,418
Kashi Bajirao Ballad

1049
01:55:41,710 --> 01:55:42,960
We've been related for years -

1050
01:55:42,960 --> 01:55:44,251
What relation?

1051
01:55:46,668 --> 01:55:47,585
Say?

1052
01:55:48,001 --> 01:55:50,501
The man you are married to,
is my husband as well.

1053
01:55:53,126 --> 01:55:54,126
Maybe so.

1054
01:55:54,418 --> 01:55:57,751
But as far as I know,
when a married man..

1055
01:55:57,751 --> 01:56:01,585
...takes another wife,
she's known as a concubine...

1056
01:56:04,460 --> 01:56:06,460
It is such a heavy word...

1057
01:56:06,835 --> 01:56:09,085
There is a simpler term for it...

1058
01:56:09,543 --> 01:56:10,751
Mistress

1059
01:56:20,335 --> 01:56:21,751
Such mockery is unbecoming of you.

1060
01:56:21,751 --> 01:56:22,876
Really!

1061
01:56:23,751 --> 01:56:25,710
But who understands
mockery better than you!

1062
01:56:26,418 --> 01:56:28,585
Leaving your people
behind in Bundelkhand..

1063
01:56:28,585 --> 01:56:31,126
...to run after a man
all the way to Pune...

1064
01:56:32,043 --> 01:56:34,043
That, Mastani Saheba, is mockery.

1065
01:56:34,293 --> 01:56:36,210
Do matters of the
heart have no meaning?

1066
01:56:36,210 --> 01:56:38,751
What heart do you talk of?

1067
01:56:39,251 --> 01:56:41,585
A heart that flitters
from one to another?

1068
01:56:43,585 --> 01:56:46,210
There is no place
for such purposeless matters...

1069
01:56:46,793 --> 01:56:48,668
Then your visit must have purpose too.

1070
01:56:48,668 --> 01:56:49,501
Of course.

1071
01:56:50,335 --> 01:56:51,543
We have a festival today.

1072
01:56:52,293 --> 01:56:56,085
Married women come together to celebrate
this day for their husbands' long lives...

1073
01:56:56,085 --> 01:56:58,460
They adorn their
foreheads with vermilion.

1074
01:57:02,835 --> 01:57:05,085
I can't demean you any further...

1075
01:57:05,668 --> 01:57:09,626
But you will have to face
a lot of humiliation here...

1076
01:57:10,043 --> 01:57:13,376
Don't take it to heart.

1077
01:57:15,168 --> 01:57:21,876
Rao's happiness lies with you
and mine with his...

1078
01:57:22,835 --> 01:57:25,126
That's my purpose.

1079
01:57:25,376 --> 01:57:26,626
Here, put.

1080
01:57:32,626 --> 01:57:34,501
This is the hand he holds...

1081
01:57:35,168 --> 01:57:38,918
He prefers holding
his sword to my hand...

1082
01:57:39,335 --> 01:57:42,460
But he holds your hand
dearer than any sword.

1083
01:57:42,668 --> 01:57:45,543
He has held my hand without
letting go of yours...

1084
01:57:45,835 --> 01:57:48,585
He has loved me,
but not broken ties with you.

1085
01:57:49,501 --> 01:57:54,585
He may call me his inspiration,
but you remain his strength...

1086
01:57:55,668 --> 01:57:57,960
His love for you has not withered.

1087
01:58:06,793 --> 01:58:09,668
I may be illegitimate,
but your coming here..

1088
01:58:10,835 --> 01:58:12,585
...has validated my
presence amongst you all.

1089
01:58:19,751 --> 01:58:21,085
Here...

1090
01:58:21,751 --> 01:58:25,251
This sari will look good on you.

1091
01:58:30,418 --> 01:58:31,626
I'll take your leave.

1092
01:58:50,001 --> 01:58:54,960
Let us celebrate the
sanctity of marriage.

1093
01:58:54,960 --> 01:59:00,335
Let us pray for our
husbands' long lives.

1094
01:59:20,335 --> 01:59:26,960
Here she comes, looking like Radha.

1095
01:59:33,085 --> 01:59:42,085
My love's innocent beloved... She
appears at my door, like a full moon.

1096
01:59:42,335 --> 01:59:52,960
Today on this occasion,
together we shall dance...

1097
02:01:31,585 --> 02:01:37,293
Your love has caused me pain,
like a dagger through my heart.

1098
02:01:39,418 --> 02:01:44,460
You may accuse me of anything,
but I'm just a soul lost in love.

1099
02:01:44,460 --> 02:01:46,793
Maybe that's our destiny...

1100
02:01:46,960 --> 02:01:51,043
To love a man who can never belong
completely to either one of us.

1101
02:02:47,085 --> 02:02:51,126
My Lord, Nizam's son, Nasirjung has
revolted against us.

1102
02:02:51,376 --> 02:02:52,710
SQ?

1103
02:02:54,376 --> 02:02:57,585
He has crossed the river Godavri
and is approaching Shahgarh.

1104
02:02:59,585 --> 02:03:00,626
SQ?

1105
02:03:01,293 --> 02:03:03,293
It appears My Lord is intoxicated.

1106
02:03:03,293 --> 02:03:04,085
SQ?

1107
02:03:05,543 --> 02:03:08,251
Who is not?

1108
02:03:08,543 --> 02:03:10,876
Everyone is intoxicated.

1109
02:03:11,501 --> 02:03:17,418
By wealth, religion, power... Pratinidhi,
Krishna Bhatt are all intoxicated.

1110
02:03:17,835 --> 02:03:19,793
So am I...

1111
02:03:21,751 --> 02:03:23,710
I am intoxicated by love!

1112
02:03:25,001 --> 02:03:27,418
You are unsteady, My Lord!

1113
02:03:44,543 --> 02:03:48,585
My feet may be unsteady
but my grip is firm.

1114
02:03:49,001 --> 02:03:50,585
<i>What say, Mama: Rae'?</i>

1115
02:03:51,001 --> 02:03:52,210
Look!

1116
02:03:54,793 --> 02:03:58,668
That is why we need you to
win this battle for us, Peshwa.

1117
02:03:58,668 --> 02:04:00,085
I am no longer the Peshwa!

1118
02:04:00,376 --> 02:04:01,668
But you are our Commander.

1119
02:04:01,668 --> 02:04:03,460
I am not a Commander either.

1120
02:04:09,835 --> 02:04:13,251
When you first learnt to ride,
we ran alongside your horse.

1121
02:04:13,585 --> 02:04:16,085
We put in as much sweat as your steed.

1122
02:04:16,335 --> 02:04:21,418
Malhar Rao fought battles beside you,
suffered injuries to uphold your honour.

1123
02:04:21,668 --> 02:04:26,210
Tukoji nursed you despite
being wounded himself.

1124
02:04:26,210 --> 02:04:28,751
Commanders aren't made overnight,
My Lord!

1125
02:04:28,751 --> 02:04:36,460
And when the enemy stands at our
gates, you are abdicating your duties.

1126
02:04:40,835 --> 02:04:45,501
Bajirao's heart may belong to Mastani,
but his life belongs to his homeland...

1127
02:04:47,626 --> 02:04:50,085
A thousand Bajiraos and
Mastanis will be happily..

1128
02:04:50,085 --> 02:04:52,710
...sacrificed for one
more Maratha victory.

1129
02:04:53,918 --> 02:04:55,710
Let it be known...

1130
02:04:56,710 --> 02:04:59,710
Bajirao will leave for
battle on New Year's eve.

1131
02:05:02,043 --> 02:05:03,251
Praise the Lord!

1132
02:05:03,918 --> 02:05:05,210
Praise the Lord!

1133
02:05:05,751 --> 02:05:07,376
Praise the Lord!

1134
02:05:13,126 --> 02:05:16,876
It's a day to light lamps,
not extinguish them.

1135
02:05:17,751 --> 02:05:19,376
You didn't send word of your arrival.

1136
02:05:19,376 --> 02:05:21,376
The Peshwa doesn't
inform of his plans.

1137
02:05:21,376 --> 02:05:23,918
You haven't been here for a while.

1138
02:05:24,501 --> 02:05:27,210
Those who wander can be found...

1139
02:05:27,501 --> 02:05:32,376
But ones who lose themselves within
their own house are hard to trace.

1140
02:05:33,251 --> 02:05:33,793
OK!

1141
02:05:34,710 --> 02:05:38,668
As the first lady of this house,
won't you see me off to war?

1142
02:05:40,376 --> 02:05:42,626
If clothes and jewels alone
make me Lady of this house

1143
02:05:43,543 --> 02:05:44,668
(Calls out to Chambermaid)

1144
02:05:45,918 --> 02:05:47,626
Bring the pooja thaali
(A prayer plate).

1145
02:05:48,585 --> 02:05:52,043
Here, sit.

1146
02:05:52,751 --> 02:05:54,793
I have left you alone, Kashi.

1147
02:05:54,793 --> 02:05:56,418
I am never alone, My Lord.

1148
02:05:56,418 --> 02:05:59,251
The entire day passes
in household chores...

1149
02:05:59,251 --> 02:06:02,668
And evenings are spent
with my Raghoba, listening to sermons.

1150
02:06:03,585 --> 02:06:09,418
The Priest told us a nice story yesterday...
Sit with me, I shall tell you.

1151
02:06:20,501 --> 02:06:23,585
The priest was saying...

1152
02:06:24,835 --> 02:06:27,001
Lord Krishna and his wife
Rukmani were having a dialogue...

1153
02:06:27,960 --> 02:06:31,501
Rukmani said, I have loved you too...

1154
02:06:31,960 --> 02:06:38,460
Yet I wish I was your
beloved and not your wife.

1155
02:06:38,918 --> 02:06:39,585
Why?

1156
02:06:39,585 --> 02:06:42,585
Lord Krishna also asked, 'Why'?

1157
02:06:44,418 --> 02:06:49,751
Rukmani said however deep a
matrimonial bond may be...

1158
02:06:49,751 --> 02:06:52,460
The world always
remembers the beloved.

1159
02:06:52,918 --> 02:06:57,626
Radhe Krishna, Radhe Krishna!
(Famous devotional chant)

1160
02:06:58,085 --> 02:07:01,501
Kashi, you are as
dear to me as Mastani.

1161
02:07:02,418 --> 02:07:05,876
Lord Krishna also said the same.

1162
02:07:06,710 --> 02:07:09,460
I have never compared you two.

1163
02:07:11,293 --> 02:07:13,626
There can be no comparison between us!

1164
02:07:14,293 --> 02:07:17,918
I didn't perform the Rasa Leela
(divine dance of passion) with you.

1165
02:07:19,418 --> 02:07:22,001
Your complaints against
Mastani and I are justified.

1166
02:07:22,001 --> 02:07:24,085
What complaints can
one have against strangers.

1167
02:07:25,376 --> 02:07:27,710
The wounds inflicted
by one's own hurt most.

1168
02:07:30,168 --> 02:07:33,168
Had you asked for my life, My Lord...

1169
02:07:33,168 --> 02:07:37,501
I would have
sacrificed it with a smile.

1170
02:07:38,126 --> 02:07:41,876
But you've stripped me of my pride.

1171
02:07:54,960 --> 02:08:00,251
I shall happily accept your punishments
for the hurt I've caused you.

1172
02:08:00,251 --> 02:08:04,293
Punishments?
No, I shall give you good news.

1173
02:08:04,293 --> 02:08:05,043
What do you mean?

1174
02:08:08,501 --> 02:08:10,876
You shall never enter these chambers again.

1175
02:08:13,710 --> 02:08:15,251
Do you know what you ask for?

1176
02:08:15,251 --> 02:08:20,210
I took a vow to keep you happy
when I set foot in this house...

1177
02:08:20,751 --> 02:08:21,960
I'm only trying to uphold it.

1178
02:08:41,793 --> 02:08:43,251
Here!

1179
02:09:34,460 --> 02:09:35,501
Praise the Lord!

1180
02:09:36,126 --> 02:09:37,418
Praise the Lord!

1181
02:09:39,626 --> 02:09:42,126
It's time to bid farewell, Mastani.

1182
02:09:44,835 --> 02:09:46,960
I shall await your return.

1183
02:09:50,043 --> 02:09:54,210
We shall meet when the setting sun
and rising moon appear together in the sky.

1184
02:09:56,085 --> 02:09:58,460
The sky will change color, and
all will be bathed in an orange glow.

1185
02:09:58,710 --> 02:10:01,960
Winds of desire will blow, And
thundering clouds will fill the skies.

1186
02:10:03,001 --> 02:10:06,210
Dry leaves will murmur and
untimely rains will wash the earth.

1187
02:10:08,793 --> 02:10:11,960
There will be no shackles of religion
or relationships to tear us apart.

1188
02:10:12,376 --> 02:10:16,460
All that will remain will
be the fire of love in our hearts...

1189
02:10:17,251 --> 02:10:21,876
On that day...
We will become one for eternity.

1190
02:11:15,668 --> 02:11:17,376
You called for me, grandmother?

1191
02:11:17,543 --> 02:11:21,001
It's time to erase the dishonour
brought to our family, Nana.

1192
02:11:22,210 --> 02:11:24,001
Arrest Mastani.

1193
02:11:25,043 --> 02:11:27,251
What shall we tell the Peshwa?

1194
02:11:28,126 --> 02:11:29,460
Don't be scared.

1195
02:11:30,293 --> 02:11:32,543
When it comes to
protecting the kingdom...

1196
02:11:33,335 --> 02:11:36,251
Even the closest
relations must be sacrificed.

1197
02:12:07,376 --> 02:12:12,710
You are in my heart, like a prayer.

1198
02:12:33,543 --> 02:12:48,793
The mention of your
name shall be my worship...

1199
02:13:08,626 --> 02:13:11,085
We have surrounded Nasirjung
from all sides, Bajirao.

1200
02:13:11,626 --> 02:13:13,210
Malhar Rao is in the
north with his troops...

1201
02:13:13,210 --> 02:13:15,335
Vaman Rao and Ambaji
Panth are in the south.

1202
02:13:15,918 --> 02:13:18,751
How shall we strategise the attack?

1203
02:13:18,918 --> 02:13:20,293
Head-on.

1204
02:13:21,418 --> 02:13:23,960
Like life does...

1205
02:13:26,376 --> 02:13:28,793
You don't know when it hits you!

1206
02:13:28,960 --> 02:13:29,793
My Lord!

1207
02:13:29,793 --> 02:13:31,626
What are you doing here, Veer Singh?

1208
02:13:31,626 --> 02:13:34,460
Nana Saheb has arrested
Mastani Saheba!

1209
02:13:51,418 --> 02:13:53,876
Bajirao!

1210
02:14:10,168 --> 02:14:11,918
Go with Bajirao.

1211
02:14:12,793 --> 02:14:14,293
Prepare for attack!

1212
02:14:14,293 --> 02:14:18,126
(War Cry)

1213
02:16:08,793 --> 02:16:12,335
It's your last chance
to return to Bundelkhand.

1214
02:16:12,335 --> 02:16:14,793
I wouldn't have allowed these shackles
if I planned to return.

1215
02:16:14,793 --> 02:16:19,543
My hatred for you goes beyond
its very essence, Mastani.

1216
02:16:22,293 --> 02:16:25,335
Your hatred only
immortalises my love, Nana.

1217
02:16:26,168 --> 02:16:27,126
Carry her child away!

1218
02:16:27,126 --> 02:16:28,460
No need for that.

1219
02:16:29,668 --> 02:16:32,293
Bajirao's son shall
walk out on his own feet.

1220
02:16:35,043 --> 02:16:36,335
Shamsher Bahadur.

1221
02:16:41,501 --> 02:16:42,418
Who is a warrior?

1222
02:16:43,210 --> 02:16:45,210
He, who fears none.

1223
02:16:46,001 --> 02:16:47,418
What is self belief?

1224
02:16:48,251 --> 02:16:49,626
Sign of victory.

1225
02:16:50,126 --> 02:16:51,335
Fear?

1226
02:16:51,335 --> 02:16:52,918
Another name for defeat.

1227
02:16:53,543 --> 02:16:54,876
Who shall be your ideal?

1228
02:16:55,210 --> 02:16:57,876
Peshwa Bajirao Ballad.

1229
02:17:02,918 --> 02:17:04,043
Goodbye.

1230
02:17:04,543 --> 02:17:06,460
Goodbye, Mother.

1231
02:17:37,460 --> 02:17:43,793
There's only one warrior in all of India
to have won forty consecutive battles.

1232
02:17:44,335 --> 02:17:46,751
Peshwa Bajirao!

1233
02:17:47,376 --> 02:17:50,543
Nasirjung has surrendered...

1234
02:17:51,085 --> 02:17:52,918
Here's to one more Maratha victory!

1235
02:17:53,918 --> 02:17:55,460
And my loss.

1236
02:17:56,626 --> 02:17:57,793
I don't understand...

1237
02:17:57,793 --> 02:18:01,335
Declare war...
I shall attack Pune next.

1238
02:18:03,293 --> 02:18:05,460
I shall release Mastani.

1239
02:18:05,918 --> 02:18:09,751
You will fight against your own family?

1240
02:18:09,918 --> 02:18:12,335
You will turn against us for Mastani?

1241
02:18:12,335 --> 02:18:16,585
And who will you kill?
Mother, Kashi or your son...

1242
02:18:58,543 --> 02:18:59,251
Bajirao...

1243
02:18:59,751 --> 02:19:01,585
I take your leave.

1244
02:19:02,043 --> 02:19:06,126
We must certify this victory before
Nasirjung can change his mind...

1245
02:19:08,835 --> 02:19:09,876
I'll be back soon.

1246
02:19:13,668 --> 02:19:15,085
Please come inside, My Lord.

1247
02:19:15,460 --> 02:19:17,293
This breeze could
aggravate your fever.

1248
02:19:17,293 --> 02:19:24,668
I am waiting for someone...

1249
02:19:27,210 --> 02:19:32,460
Mastani, you have run out of options,
so name your last wish...

1250
02:19:32,668 --> 02:19:35,126
How would you like to die?

1251
02:19:36,710 --> 02:19:38,460
With Peshwa Bajirao!

1252
02:19:46,043 --> 02:19:48,543
This ailment is beyond
my understanding, Sir.

1253
02:19:49,210 --> 02:19:52,543
The fever shows no sign of subsiding.

1254
02:19:53,001 --> 02:19:56,335
It is time to call Kashi and Mother.

1255
02:19:56,668 --> 02:19:59,460
Being with family
might improve his health.

1256
02:20:52,335 --> 02:20:56,918
The king's orders are against us,
Grandmother.

1257
02:20:57,168 --> 02:20:58,501
Are you listening?

1258
02:20:59,543 --> 02:21:02,501
He says he cannot lose
a warrior like Bajirao...

1259
02:21:03,793 --> 02:21:07,168
And hence we must release Mastani.

1260
02:21:07,918 --> 02:21:09,460
I shall travel to
the capital tomorrow.

1261
02:21:10,418 --> 02:21:11,793
I shall speak to the king.

1262
02:21:11,793 --> 02:21:13,335
I shall travel to Ravelkhedi tomorrow...

1263
02:21:15,376 --> 02:21:16,876
Bajirao is unwell.

1264
02:21:17,418 --> 02:21:19,460
And nothing can happen
till I return with him.

1265
02:21:25,710 --> 02:21:27,210
Are you scared, Grandmother?

1266
02:21:27,751 --> 02:21:29,751
You all may bow down before Mastani...

1267
02:21:30,793 --> 02:21:32,918
But I shall not!

1268
02:21:34,460 --> 02:21:36,085
I shall not!

1269
02:21:46,793 --> 02:21:49,126
Look who is here, My Lord.

1270
02:22:12,918 --> 02:22:13,751
Mastani

1271
02:22:27,668 --> 02:22:29,168
ls Shamsher well?

1272
02:22:30,501 --> 02:22:31,376
Yes, he is.

1273
02:22:36,960 --> 02:22:38,376
He's learning to ride.

1274
02:22:41,918 --> 02:22:42,876
Kashi?

1275
02:22:46,293 --> 02:22:47,418
She's well too...

1276
02:22:50,210 --> 02:22:54,501
Busy pretending that her heart
has turned to stone.

1277
02:23:07,585 --> 02:23:10,043
I need your stamp on this.

1278
02:23:10,460 --> 02:23:11,460
Later.

1279
02:23:11,626 --> 02:23:12,501
This can't wait.

1280
02:23:13,001 --> 02:23:14,460
What is so urgent?

1281
02:23:14,460 --> 02:23:15,918
Mastani's release orders.

1282
02:23:17,668 --> 02:23:19,668
Have you lost your mind, Kashi?

1283
02:23:19,668 --> 02:23:22,210
Only she can save Bajirao.

1284
02:23:23,668 --> 02:23:24,960
I cannot approve this.

1285
02:23:24,960 --> 02:23:26,793
I cannot see Bajirao losing himself.

1286
02:23:28,585 --> 02:23:33,293
The man who never lost a
battle is losing to his own family.

1287
02:23:33,293 --> 02:23:34,960
I cannot approve that!

1288
02:23:36,835 --> 02:23:37,751
Stamp this!

1289
02:23:38,626 --> 02:23:42,293
She has no rights in the Peshwa family.

1290
02:23:42,293 --> 02:23:44,585
But I do... And I'm demanding it.

1291
02:23:46,168 --> 02:23:47,918
As the lady of this house.

1292
02:23:49,418 --> 02:23:50,418
Stamp this.

1293
02:23:56,918 --> 02:23:59,043
Take this to Nana Saheb right away.

1294
02:24:31,626 --> 02:24:33,543
What is the news from Ravelkhedi?

1295
02:24:34,001 --> 02:24:38,793
How is the Peshwa?

1296
02:24:39,501 --> 02:24:41,626
I too await news of him.

1297
02:24:42,168 --> 02:24:44,460
Until then, pray for him.

1298
02:24:47,501 --> 02:24:53,126
(Prayers)

1299
02:25:25,126 --> 02:25:27,418
What is the message?

1300
02:25:27,418 --> 02:25:34,918
Grandmother has ordered
Mastani's release.

1301
02:25:51,335 --> 02:25:52,751
Where are you going, Bajirao?

1302
02:25:52,751 --> 02:25:54,293
Look, Shaniwar Wada is on fire!

1303
02:25:54,293 --> 02:25:55,918
No, it isn't...

1304
02:25:56,335 --> 02:26:00,460
Bajirao, this isn't Pune...
We are in Ravelkhedi.

1305
02:26:01,085 --> 02:26:02,793
You are burning up!

1306
02:26:02,793 --> 02:26:03,876
Mastani!

1307
02:26:04,793 --> 02:26:07,626
She is on her way, Bajirao.

1308
02:26:09,168 --> 02:26:11,918
You've been advised bed rest.

1309
02:26:32,251 --> 02:26:33,293
Bajirao!

1310
02:26:33,293 --> 02:26:35,626
The enemy...

1311
02:26:36,751 --> 02:26:38,126
No one's there!

1312
02:26:38,126 --> 02:26:41,418
Enemy with black flags!

1313
02:26:42,126 --> 02:26:43,460
Which enemy?

1314
02:26:43,460 --> 02:26:44,960
Destiny...

1315
02:26:46,168 --> 02:26:47,460
God...

1316
02:26:48,585 --> 02:26:50,876
Can't take Mastani away.

1317
02:26:55,210 --> 02:26:56,918
Bajirao...

1318
02:27:18,168 --> 02:27:22,418
We shall meet when the setting sun
and rising moon appear together in the sky.

1319
02:29:41,918 --> 02:29:47,418
The sky will change color, and
all will be bathed in an orange glow.

1320
02:30:08,501 --> 02:30:12,543
Winds of desire will blow, And
thundering clouds will fill the skies.

1321
02:30:47,585 --> 02:30:51,751
Dry leaves will murmur and
untimely rains will wash the earth.

1322
02:31:06,710 --> 02:31:11,168
There will be no shackles of religion
or relationships to tear us apart.

1323
02:31:13,043 --> 02:31:16,043
All that will remain will
be the fire of love in our hearts...

1324
02:31:17,210 --> 02:31:20,960
On that day...
We will become one for eternity.

1325
02:32:16,126 --> 02:32:19,710
Our hearts beat together, Mastani.

1326
02:32:21,126 --> 02:32:23,376
And cease together, too.

1327
02:32:39,085 --> 02:32:43,293
On a day when fate
and time stood witness...

1328
02:32:43,293 --> 02:32:47,335
Two star crossed
lovers breathed their last.

1329
02:32:47,668 --> 02:32:52,210
They say witnessing a falling
star fulfills any wish...

1330
02:32:52,585 --> 02:32:59,210
...But these two stars fell to earth
wishing only to belong to each other.

1331
02:32:59,418 --> 02:33:01,668
They stand testament
to eternal love...

1332
02:33:01,668 --> 02:33:03,960
Love, that knows no religion.

1333
02:33:04,418 --> 02:33:07,710
Love that is a gift from God...
Love that in itself is Supreme.
