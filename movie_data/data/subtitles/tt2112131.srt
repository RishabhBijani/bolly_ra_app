And listen.
Don't trouble anyone, okay.

Okay, mother.

5
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:06,760
These days there have been
a lot of complaints about you.

6
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:08,390
Bye.
- Bye, mother.

7
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:11,860
Mother!

8
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:13,830
Let go. Let go of the child.

9
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,760
Take him along.

10
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:17,230
My son.

11
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:18,200
Quickly.

12
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:20,040
Start the car, quickly.

13
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,840
You deal..
- Sir, what about the land?

14
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:28,350
Hello.

Anshul, the child's
name is Anshul Gupta and..

18
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:39,390
He's believed to be Cement
Trader Chetan Gupta's son.

19
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:41,050
We've learnt that Chetan Gupta“

20
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,030
has been demanded a
ransom of one million rupees.

21
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:46,120
This entire incident
occurred in Bajariya area..

22
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,220
And a new Police officer
has been appointed here..

23
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:50,100
And his name is Chulbul Pande.

24
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:52,230
We couldn't contact Mr. Pande yet..

25
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,400
What a strange city?
- What's wrong, papa?

26
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:57,450
Crime in the morning.

27
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,570
Couldn't the department
send someone else?

28
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,150
Wrong place to transfer him.

29
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:04,250
Brother wasn't transferred.

30
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:05,980
Instead he got himself transferred.

31
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:09,260
He was saying "he wants the
achieve big feat in the big city.

32
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,390
Achieve big feats?

33
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,920
Shut up!
Your wailing is making me deaf.

34
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:17,400
Shut up!

35
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,100
I want my mother.

36
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,260
Shut up!

37
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:22,970
Shut up will you.

38
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,230
You're stuck in this
because of your father.

39
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,070
I want to go to my papa.

40
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,270
He's delaying in bringing the money.

41
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:29,500
Shut up!

42
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,280
Take a look.

43
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:50,190
What's he saying?

44
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,930
Hey stupid, listen closely.

45
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,960
This is Tiwari and I am Chaubey.

46
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:57,340
We're Chulbul Pande's colleagues.

47
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:59,960
This time,
sir isn't coming through here"

48
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:02,130
"but that way!

49
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,010
Oh no!

50
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:55,190
So... My name is..

51
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:56,930
Chulbul..

52
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,190
Chulbul Pande.
- Correct.

53
00:07:58,590 --> 00:07:59,690
Chulbul Pande.

54
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:01,960
The government has given
me the responsibility..

55
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:03,970
To maintain law and order.

56
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:06,000
Who are you?

57
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,130
Who am I?
- Gappu.

58
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,300
Gappu.

59
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,270
So Gappu.

60
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,800
This issue is between you and me.

61
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,650
This child.

62
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:14,610
Child...

63
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,840
PaPPU-
. PaPPu-

64
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:18,280
This child Pappu is third party.

65
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,690
Why don't you recommend something..

66
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:23,310
So that he's stays
away from trouble and enjoys.

67
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,890
The child enjoys!

68
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,020
Safe!

69
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,190
Safe position.

70
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:28,730
Come Pappu.

71
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,020
First I will give you a kiss..

72
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,160
"Then teach these three a lesson.

73
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:34,890
Sit down.

74
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:37,830
What's your father's name, son?
- Chetan Gupta.

75
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:39,240
And your mother“

76
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:45,210
Mother!

77
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,700
Let's fly.

78
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:24,950
Stop-
- There's Pappu!

79
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:49,410
Sorry!

80
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:53,370
Sorry!

81
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,150
Chaubey, what are you doing here?

82
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,090
Where is Chulbur sir?

83
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:06,960
Stop worrying about Chulbul sir!

84
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:08,830
You should be worrying
about the goons.

85
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,420
He's Kung-fu Pande.

86
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,320
Sit.

87
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,230
Serve him tea.
- Yes.

88
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,100
Leave me.

89
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:32,780
Mommy!
- Stop, Pappu. Stop.

90
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:36,820
Ramu.

91
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,420
What are you doing here?
- I beg you.

92
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:44,260
Go up!
- Run!

93
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:45,430
Go, leave.

94
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,460
Inspector.

95
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,830
Inspector.

96
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:04,310
Quiet! Quiet!

97
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:17,990
Come on!

98
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,140
Who's calling?
- Mother.

99
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:31,240
Then answer it.
- Okay.

100
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,510
Hello, aunt. Greetings.

101
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,250
Chulbul Pande speaking.

102
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:36,480
He's a rascal, sir.

103
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,040
Sir!

104
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,320
Catch.

105
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:42,850
See you again.
- Thank you. See you, sir.

106
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:34,800
Enjoyed.
- Yes, uncle.

107
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,400
You didn't tell me your mother's name.

108
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:39,570
Mommy.
- My son. My child.

109
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:41,280
Mr. Gupta.
- Yes.

110
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:42,410
Thank you very much.

111
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,040
You saved my son's life.

112
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:45,310
No need for that.

113
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:48,580
He enjoyed a lot.
- Yes.

114
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,590
Mr. Gupta.
- Yes.

115
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:52,490
The attaché case looks hold.

116
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,260
Hand it over to Mr. Chaubey.

117
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:56,290
There's money in it.

118
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:58,390
I know. One million.

119
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,360
You can pay the killer.

120
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:03,230
But not the saviour.

121
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:04,260
Right, mommy.

122
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,930
Yes of course, give it.

123
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:07,240
Haven't you heard his name?

124
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,800
Robin Hood Pande.

125
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,740
The real Social Worker!

126
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:12,710
He's not a rascal like you.

127
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,870
You can send detectives after me..

128
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,910
But you can't appoint a
bodyguard for the child. - Quiet.

129
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:19,080
I will expose all your
wrong deeds. - Quiet.

130
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:21,090
I will defame you in the society.
- Here, take it.

131
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:23,420
Mr. Chaubey,
I think this isn't my jurisdiction.

132
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:24,420
Yes.

133
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:27,130
Let's go.
- I'd rather break your head.

134
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,660
Sir, press.

135
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,820
Mr. Pande,
you created a sensation in Kanpur.

136
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:31,800
I think we're going to have fun.

137
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:33,390
Of course, definitely you will.

138
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,900
Sir, we want to ask
you a few questions.

139
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:38,130
So that was Chulbul Pande,
alias Robin Hood Pande.

140
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:41,230
I think Kanpur has finally
got its share of fearless inspector.

141
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:43,440
He's said we're definitely
going to have fun.

142
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:47,010
This is Raina Tripathi,
with cameraman Bablu Tanwar.

143
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:49,810
Chulbul.

144
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,420
Come on.
- Slowly. It pains.

145
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,120
Slowly.

146
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:57,950
Come on. Get it.

147
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:00,320
Sir, shall I put this
in Chulbul Pande Welfare Fund.

148
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,260
Do as you please, Mr. Chaubey.

149
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,800
What are you doing, Mr. Sharma?

150
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:06,860
Locking them up, sir.

151
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,270
I can see that, but why?

152
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:11,430
So that they don't run away?

153
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:14,100
Escapees.
- Yes, sir.

154
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:17,300
That reminds me.

155
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,450
What was it?

156
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:26,150
If criminals escape
from my police station"

157
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:28,160
"then to hell with
the police station, and..

158
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,780
To hell with Inspector.

159
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:34,990
Inspector. Mr. Sharma.

160
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,520
"Swords wielding
and arrows being shot."

161
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:09,860
"Death shivers in its boots."

162
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,490
"Swords wielding
and arrows being shot."

163
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:17,200
"Death shivers in its boots."

164
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:22,000
"All the direction
tremors when I roar."

165
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:26,540
"When the sinner's in his clutches."

166
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:29,940
"When the sinner's in his clutches."

167
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:33,420
"His breath stops."

168
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:39,460
"Fearless."

169
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:42,050
"Fearless."

170
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,430
"Fearless."

171
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:47,090
"Fearless."

172
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:49,530
"Fearless."

173
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,100
"Fearless."

174
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,540
"Fearless."

175
00:15:55,230 --> 00:16:00,040
"The sky quivers, the earth shakes."

176
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:03,320
"His footsteps cause earthquakes."

177
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:05,390
"Earthquakes."

178
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:12,260
"Evil never crosses its path."

179
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:17,590
"Sinners are scared of him."

180
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:27,240
"The weak praise him
and the helpless pray to him."

181
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:32,280
"Whoever locks horns with him,
regrets it all his life."

182
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:37,280
"When the sinner's in his clutches."

183
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:44,120
"His breath stops."

184
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:15,120
"Kills two with one punch."

185
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:27,660
"Bashes their head in."

186
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:37,300
"No one recovers from his slap."

187
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:42,310
"When fire erupts in his eyes,
it even melts iron."

188
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:48,190
"When the sinner's in his clutches."

189
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:52,420
"When the sinner's in his clutches."

190
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:57,400
"His breath stops."

191
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:02,230
"Fearless."

192
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:04,570
"Fearless."

193
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:07,200
"Fearless."

194
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,680
"Fearless."

195
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:12,240
"Fearless."

196
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:14,610
"Fearless."

197
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,240
"Fearless."

198
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:20,180
"Fearless."

199
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:28,430
See you, Tiwari.
- Jai Hind, sir.

200
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,290
That reminds me how is your son?
- He's fine, sir.

201
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:34,200
Give him my love.
- Yes, sir.

202
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:49,540
Such grace.

203
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:53,380
I think you've gelled
quietly nicely with Kanpur.

204
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:54,850
I'm a police officer's wife.

205
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,420
I will gel with any place you take me.

206
00:18:57,910 --> 00:19:01,120
Then turn around,
and march towards the bedroom.

207
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,560
It's been ages since I heard that.

208
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,230
By the way,
there are others here from Lalganj.

209
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:08,460
Do you want me to send them back?

210
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:14,310
Papa.
- Chulbul, are you okay?

211
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,970
The news on television
really got me worried.

212
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:18,200
And I couldn't contact you either.

213
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,580
Everything's fine, papa.

214
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:22,540
The child's been safely
handover to her mother.

215
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:24,480
They also rewarded
me with one million.

216
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:26,490
So I deposited 200,000
in the police welfare fund..

217
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:30,960
And the rest in Chulbul
Pande Charitable Trust.

218
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:32,420
Such a big reward?

219
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,550
It was a big feat.

220
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:36,420
Here.

221
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:38,090
Roasted groundnuts for you.

222
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:39,500
Where is Makki?

223
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:40,590
There he is.

224
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:43,260
I see.

225
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:45,270
Let me shower some love on him.

226
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:50,100
Makki.

227
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:52,070
Get up, Makki.

228
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,170
What is it, brother?

229
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:57,450
Were you sleeping?
- Yes.

230
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:00,280
You should've told
me that you were sleeping.

231
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:03,250
I wouldn't have disturbed you.

232
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,490
Oh, brother.

233
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,990
It was such a nice dream.

234
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:13,260
Why do you trouble the poor guy?

235
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:17,640
Do you want me to trouble you?
- Yes.

236
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,440
But only after four whistles.

237
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:28,140
Not yours. The cooker.

238
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:30,510
So control emotions until then.

239
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:34,180
Acting smart with me.

240
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:45,060
Why are you so worried about Nirmala?

241
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:46,630
Didn't she say she will come back?

242
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,070
She won't come back, sister-in-law?

243
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,360
Why?

244
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:53,270
I told Nirmala that "Brother's
getting transferred to Kanpur".

245
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,280
"We're all going there
so you come along as well."

246
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,780
She said "I won't come".

247
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,140
"I will stay here and
look after my father."

248
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:00,310
"You stay here as well."

249
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:03,940
I said "I will look after my father,
not yours".

250
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,050
And we had an argument on this issue.

251
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:06,980
She asked me to leave"

252
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:08,460
and I said "You can go to hell".

253
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,320
"I am leaving" and here I am.

254
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:12,990
So, can I keep this?

255
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,350
Sister-i n-law.

256
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,160
Photo.

257
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:38,510
See you.

258
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:46,890
See you!

259
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,220
Softly!

260
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,490
See you.

261
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,320
Papa.
- Yes.

262
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,200
I've brought a Zeus phone for you.

263
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:55,990
I've heard good reviews about it.

264
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,270
You did the right thing, son.

265
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,200
Now I can trouble you every hour.

266
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:02,210
You can also listen to music.
Allow me.

267
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,450
That's my favourite.

268
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:09,410
I'll change it.
- No, no.

269
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:10,780
It's nice.

270
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:13,080
Let it play, I'll hear it.
- I see.

271
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:14,210
See you.
- Okay.

272
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,050
It has a camera as well.
- Camera!

273
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:24,460
You're forgetting something.

274
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,920
Rajjo, control your emotions.

275
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:28,190
Father's sitting outside.

276
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:29,570
He might get a heart-attack.

277
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:53,090
Thank you.

278
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,430
See you.

279
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,010
Hello.

280
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,480
Hello, who is this?

281
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:16,450
Prajapati Pande speaking.

282
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:19,420
Oh, God. My prince charming.

283
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:21,450
Hello.

284
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:26,350
That will keep papa busy.

285
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,260
Yes, sir.

286
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:31,860
Sir, we need to go to
the SP sir's office. - Why?

287
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:34,370
He wants to meet you.

288
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:37,630
He's an interesting man.
- Can't you hear? Move it.

289
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:38,460
Move the cart.
- Forgive me, sir..

290
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:39,600
Politely, Wardi Singh.

291
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:41,470
Do you talk to your father like that?

292
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:44,300
Giving the police force a bad name.

293
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:46,170
Come on.

294
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:49,380
Let's see how interesting is your SP.

295
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:51,380
It makes my blood boil.

296
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,620
Let's go.

297
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:06,330
I really... love pizza.

298
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:08,160
Allow me, sir.
- Let it be.

299
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,660
I have it twice a week for lunch.

300
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:13,170
And I don't pay for it either.

301
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:15,210
Ask how?
- How?

302
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:19,680
The company states "Delivery
in 30 minutes or free".

303
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,080
They're always 10 minutes late.

304
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,670
Ask how?
- How?

305
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:27,680
The constable at the
crossroad keeps him busy.

306
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:31,190
Right.

307
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:33,020
You serve the people..

308
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:35,360
So you can take some reward for it.

309
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:38,360
Pande.

310
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:41,020
I'm really pleased
with your kidnapping case.

311
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:42,070
Thank you, sir.

312
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:43,430
I've a rule.

313
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:46,370
Whether junior or senior,
when someone does a good job..

314
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:48,030
It makes me really happy.

315
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,100
And about me.

316
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,410
In 17 years of my service"

317
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:55,550
I've learnt more of what not to do.

318
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:59,580
So, I work less and
save more of my service.

319
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:01,190
Right, sir.

320
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:03,050
There are people like
you in the department"

321
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,590
and also like me.

322
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:07,660
Maintain the pressure.

323
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:09,330
The administration should be proper.

324
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:11,560
Perfect balance.

325
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,900
Come on. Have some pizza.

326
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:16,000
You have it, sir.

327
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:17,200
It's enough for you.

328
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,180
Shiv Balak Verma speaking.

329
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:27,010
Don't worry, sir.
I am not scared of anyone.

330
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:29,340
I will surely testify against Baccha.

331
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:31,880
Yes, sir.
I am coming directly to the court.

332
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:33,350
Yes, sir. Goodbye.

333
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:54,930
They killed him!

334
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:56,940
They killed him!

335
00:25:57,770 --> 00:26:00,040
I told you he will kill you!

336
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:02,050
They killed him!

337
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:06,020
They killed Murari's father.

338
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:09,180
Inspector, what are you doing here?

339
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:11,850
Go and catch Baccha.

340
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,260
He's the one who killed him.

341
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,390
Go and catch Baccha.

342
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:36,310
Who does he think he is?

343
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:37,980
Baccha isn't God!

344
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:40,220
He cannot seize the temple.

345
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,420
Why can't we go in?

346
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,390
I will go in. Let's see who stops me.

347
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:45,050
Anyone can try stopping me.

348
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,650
Move. Move aside.
- What?

349
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:48,920
Why are you creating a racket?

350
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:51,430
Are you in a hurry?

351
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,260
Can't you see the Lord's busy inside?

352
00:26:57,430 --> 00:26:58,930
It was a mistake. Don't beat him.

353
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,910
I am not beating him,
I'm just talking to him.

354
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:02,170
This is called beating.
- What are you doing? Don't beat him.

355
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:03,770
Don't beat him.
- This. Like this.

356
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:14,150
Why are you creating a scene here?

357
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:17,110
What if some media
personnel had seen this?

358
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:19,150
They're always looking
for opportunities.

359
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:21,350
To defame him.

360
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:24,330
The veneration ends.

361
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:28,030
Move aside.

362
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:28,970
Give some space.

363
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:30,130
Move.

364
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:32,430
Move aside. Move aside. Come on.

365
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:43,940
Brother Genda.

366
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:45,180
There she is.

367
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,180
That one's nice, right grandpa.

368
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,050
This one.

369
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:50,280
What do you want?

370
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:58,470
Look.
- Let's go, Let's go.

371
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:01,060
Wonder when she'll
shower some love on me?

372
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:03,860
Give me some love.

373
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:11,740
Yes, son.

374
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:14,040
The job's done.
- Bless you, son.

375
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:17,140
Now stay out of the
city for a few days.

376
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:19,180
Fine, brother. We get it.

377
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,380
Respected Mr. Verma.

378
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:27,350
He was adamant on
testifying against me.

379
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:30,190
I sent him straight to hell.

380
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:35,070
This new inspector is quite popular.

381
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,540
He's name is Chulbul Pande.

382
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:39,370
He rescued the child from
the kidnappers within three hours.

383
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,870
He's been quite a handful in Lalganj.

384
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:43,540
Right, Radhe.
- Yes, brother.

385
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,180
He uprooted Chedi completely.

386
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,080
We were fortunate to escape.

387
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:49,380
He's a stubborn police officer,
brother.

388
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:50,880
So what do you want me to do?

389
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:53,250
Do you want me to retire to Haridwar?

390
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,010
Leave Kanpur forever?

391
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,220
Brother, I was just"
- Yes, I know.

392
00:28:57,910 --> 00:29:01,120
He's more of a businessman
and less of a police officer. - Yes.

393
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:04,390
He's here to expand
his business in this city.

394
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:06,190
Let's see.

395
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:10,400
Whether he's beneficial for me or not.

396
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:16,140
Hit it.
- Take it. Take it.

397
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:19,240
Volleyball's the best game"

398
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,370
"strengthen every
police officer's arms.

399
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,910
We'll need to get used to it.

400
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:26,940
Sir.

401
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,220
Sir.
- Yes, Siddiqui.

402
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,550
We're playing cops and robbers.

403
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:32,460
Sir. Robber cops. Or cops robber.

404
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,590
Sir. These two are Phd
holders in the crime world.

405
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:38,230
They're dangerous criminals.

406
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:40,600
They've many cases of loot,
plunder and murder.

407
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:43,900
But the public are so scared"

408
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:46,240
"that we don't have a single
witness or evidence against them..

409
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,240
All because of Baccha.

410
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:48,300
And they're realised.

411
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:51,110
Don't blame the people.

412
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,700
The people are not at fault.

413
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:53,980
Right, Chaubey.

414
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,380
Then we've to give them degree.

415
00:29:56,410 --> 00:29:57,910
Third degree, sir.

416
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:01,920
Such rascals should be taken
to the banks of Ganga and sacrificed.

417
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:04,050
Mr. Sharma, a new avatar?

418
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,080
These rascals have been troubling"

419
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:08,430
"the people and police
for five-six years.

420
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:09,790
So let's test them.

421
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:14,400
Can they endure the same
pain they've given others?

422
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:16,770
Yes, sir.

423
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,260
Brother.
- Let the police come.

424
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:50,170
I don't look like a goon, do I?

425
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,310
What's that?

426
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:03,780
'Gulab Jamun' (Sweets).

427
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:05,210
That reminds me.

428
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:07,010
Mr. Tiwari.
- Yes, sir.

429
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:08,820
You were supposed to
get your hernia operated.

430
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,950
I got it clone before
being transferred to Kanpur.

431
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:12,150
It's better now.
- I see.

432
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:13,320
Yes.

433
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:17,170
Won't you welcome me?

434
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:44,320
Put it clown.

435
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:47,020
Wait. Public safety.

436
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:49,360
Hey you.

437
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,160
Come on, get going.

438
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,120
Save me..

439
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:23,420
Mr. Sharma, careful.

440
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,290
No. No.

441
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:41,940
No. No.

442
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,470
God... be with you!

443
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:48,480
Mr. Sharma.

444
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:13,230
Why you..

445
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,050
Chulbul.

446
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:36,920
I swear I won't spare you next time.

447
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,360
Don't ever swear.

448
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:51,010
Liar.

449
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,710
Hello.

450
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,180
Mr. Pande.
- Sir, sir.

451
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:57,210
Mr. Pande.

452
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:59,580
What does the police have
to say about this incident?

453
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:02,280
The following are the
details of the incident.

454
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:04,190
Mr. Sharma received a call..

455
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:06,490
And few people
are planning a robbery.

456
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,020
And you killed them.

457
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:10,890
Look, I am a peace-loving inspector.

458
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,090
Killing is too far-fetched.

459
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:15,030
<i>L</i><i> never even CUSS anyone.</i>

460
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:18,000
Right, Mr. Tiwari.
- He's there, sir.

461
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,340
Yes, sir.

462
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,400
Look. Our sir is very generous.

463
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:24,380
Even the use of truncheons
are banned in the station.

464
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:26,370
If he wants to slap anyone"

465
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,780
he makes sure that
he doesn't hit ear. - Yes.

466
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:30,280
Mr. Pande, what happened next?

467
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:32,510
We surrounded them and
asked them to surrender.

468
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:34,520
But they started firing at us.

469
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:36,360
So we replied.

470
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:38,880
By opening fire.

471
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:40,950
You could've arrested them as well.

472
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:42,390
Why did you have to kill them?

473
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:45,890
Madam reporter, what do you want?

474
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,430
Some of our police men
could've died in their firing.

475
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:51,400
And Mr. Sharma would've
been lying shot.

476
00:35:55,130 --> 00:35:56,470
There.

477
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:01,480
Mr. Sharma, what are you thinking?

478
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:05,820
I didn't let it happen.
- Yes, sir.

479
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,920
Look, if we lose police men..

480
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:10,820
"Then who will look after all of you.

481
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:13,050
I want to ask you one last question,
Mr. Pande.

482
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:16,330
I think that's enough
for such a small incident.

483
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:19,260
Given to the current
condition of the city..

484
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:22,060
We both have work to do.

485
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:23,230
Good bye.

486
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:24,900
See you.

487
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,100
By the way, what time will
this be broadcasted on television?

488
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:32,610
On 9:30. And the repeat at 10:30.

489
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:34,610
Thank you.

490
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,940
Please, answer our questions.

491
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:37,280
Sir, one question.

492
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,280
Pandey's saying they are looters.

493
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:41,610
But he didn't link them to you.

494
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:44,610
Yes, I noticed that.

495
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:46,590
As much as I know this inspecton.

496
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:48,990
I am sure there's a plan behind it.

497
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:51,860
Anyway, we'll deal with
him when the time comes.

498
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:54,130
You've become hot news.

499
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:55,940
That's a good thing.
- Thank you.

500
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:57,790
Hajmola.
- No, sir.

501
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,290
It's good for digestion.

502
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:01,090
And it's tangy.

503
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:02,890
I finish a bottle in the entire day.

504
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:05,700
And to digest that.
- Another bottle.

505
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:10,900
By the way, both the shooters
worked for Baccha. - Yes.

506
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,270
And they murdered Shiv Bala.
- Yes.

507
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:17,110
Why didn't you tell this to the media?

508
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:18,970
Sir, it wouldn't have
given us any result.

509
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,740
We couldn't have reached a conclusion.

510
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,640
We would've been busy
with the proceedings.

511
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,080
It's not that easy for the law..

512
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:28,140
To throw criminals
like Baccha behind bars.

513
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,220
You're right.

514
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:32,310
I've a similar experience.

515
00:37:32,410 --> 00:37:36,380
But there should be pressure
on people like Baccha.

516
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,050
We'll go ahead with
the proceedings, sir.

517
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,260
But I will do it my way.

518
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,660
Like you say.

519
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:43,930
Maintain pressure.
- Yes sir.

520
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,260
Come, I'll treat
you to some sweetmeat.

521
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:49,930
This is Banarasi, madam. The red one.

522
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:01,980
Are we in the fields?
- No, sir. This is the main street.

523
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,780
Incredible India!
- Yes.

524
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:06,190
- Find out who's the MLA here.
- Right.

525
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,320
My wife's waiting.
- But, sir.

526
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,030
Excuse me.
- Yes.

527
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,260
Can you lend me your cycle?
- Of course.

528
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:16,460
Thank you.

529
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,830
Sir's taking the cycle.

530
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:23,140
Mother cowl

531
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:33,810
Move aside.

532
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,820
Move aside. Make way.

533
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,150
I've been waiting for so long.

534
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:46,060
It's a police job.

535
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:48,160
So I got delayed.

536
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,000
There was a cow sitting
in the middle of the road.

537
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:52,000
But here I am.

538
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:54,160
Shop all you want.
Take all that you can.

539
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:55,400
I'm standing right here.

540
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:21,860
"Deceitful .“.

541
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:24,790
"Deceitful .“.

542
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:30,340
"You're eyes are deceitful."

543
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:34,180
"Your eyes. ."

544
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:39,310
"Your eyes. ."

545
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,750
"Your eyes. ."

546
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,980
"Your eyes. ."

547
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:47,990
"Your eyes. ."

548
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:55,060
"Deceitful .“.

549
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:57,260
"Deceitful .“.

550
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:02,070
"You're eyes are deceitful."

551
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,900
"We met just yesterday."

552
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,710
"We met just yesterday."

553
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:08,750
"We met just yesterday."

554
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:12,610
"And forgot all about me today."

555
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:14,380
"Deceitful .“.

556
00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:17,280
"Deceitful .“.

557
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:22,630
"You're eyes are deceitful."

558
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:54,820
"Why are you so upset with Chulbul?"

559
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:59,950
"Why don't you listen to me?"

560
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:02,820
"Why are you after me?"

561
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,920
"Let me go."

562
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:09,430
"I don't know what
your intentions are."

563
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:14,940
"I want to give you my heart."

564
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:21,980
"Ask with a smile and
I'll give up my life."

565
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,080
"We met just yesterday."

566
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:26,750
"We met just yesterday."

567
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:27,950
"We met just yesterday."

568
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:31,830
"And forgot all about me today."

569
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,760
"Deceitful .“.

570
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:36,360
"Deceitful .“.

571
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:41,800
"You're eyes are deceitful."

572
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:53,480
"You're eyes are deceitful."

573
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:59,980
"You're eyes are deceitful."

574
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:07,060
"The world's scared of me."

575
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:13,730
"But I am scared of you, you know."

576
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:17,000
"Don't try to persuade me."

577
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:19,070
"Let me go.

578
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:23,340
"I do know it all."

579
00:42:23,970 --> 00:42:29,350
"I love your grace."

580
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:36,190
"There's approval in your no."

581
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,320
"We met just yesterday."

582
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,090
"We met just yesterday."

583
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:42,170
"We met just yesterday."

584
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:46,100
"And forgot all about me today."

585
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:48,100
"Deceitful .“.

586
00:42:48,530 --> 00:42:50,370
"Deceitful .“.

587
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:55,510
"You're eyes are deceitful."

588
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,450
"Deceitful .“.

589
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:00,950
"Deceitful .“.

590
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:06,010
"You're eyes are deceitful."

591
00:43:16,790 --> 00:43:18,100
What's wrong?

592
00:43:18,190 --> 00:43:19,900
Couldn't sleep tonight?

593
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,300
Were you missing Nirmala?

594
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:23,400
Oh, brother.

595
00:43:23,430 --> 00:43:26,100
Even you think I am missing Nirmala.

596
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:28,940
If that's not true then
you will have to prove it?

597
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,910
I will ask you a riddle.

598
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:33,210
And if you answer it correctly,
then I will believe you.

599
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:34,580
Fine.

600
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:37,050
Fateh Singh and Banne.

601
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:37,920
Who?

602
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:39,580
Banne and Fateh Singh.

603
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:40,410
No, no.

604
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:43,590
Fateh Singh and Banne and you.

605
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:46,490
Went into the jungle for hunting?
- For what?

606
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:48,430
For hunting.

607
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:50,600
Fateh Singh was killed by a lion.

608
00:43:50,890 --> 00:43:53,230
Banne was blown away by a storm.

609
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:54,970
Two died in the jungle.

610
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:57,240
The one left returned from the jungle.

611
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:03,410
So tell me..
who returned from the jungle?

612
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:06,150
Jungle.

613
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:10,250
Who returned from the jungle?

614
00:44:11,110 --> 00:44:12,920
It's a difficult riddle.

615
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:15,020
It'll take you some time.

616
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:17,960
Think about it and tell me.

617
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:22,270
Who returned from the jungle?

618
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:26,360
He's asked me a difficult question.

619
00:44:26,990 --> 00:44:27,990
Papa.
- Huh.

620
00:44:28,090 --> 00:44:30,300
Tell me, who returned from the jungle.

621
00:44:31,130 --> 00:44:33,170
What a strange question?

622
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:35,280
One was eaten up by the lion.

623
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:37,370
The other got blown away by the storm.

624
00:44:37,870 --> 00:44:39,510
So who was left?

625
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:41,640
Who returned from the jungle?

626
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:48,890
Chulbul asked you this riddle.

627
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:50,220
Why should I answer it?

628
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:51,390
Fine, don't tell me.

629
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:52,960
I will find the answer myself.

630
00:44:58,990 --> 00:45:01,200
There was once a
Kaalidas and a Devdas..

631
00:45:01,290 --> 00:45:04,170
And now there's Makkidas.

632
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:09,670
Hey. Raise the gates.

633
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:12,680
It's Baccha's vehicle.
Raise the barricade.

634
00:45:13,070 --> 00:45:15,250
It'll cost you 40 rupees,
you'll have to buy a ticket.

635
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:17,420
Have you lost your mind?

636
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:19,160
Here's your 40 rupees.

637
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:22,020
Tell them Khilawan was
here and he shot at you.

638
00:45:27,690 --> 00:45:29,100
Hello.

639
00:45:29,190 --> 00:45:30,530
Bajariya police station.

640
00:45:36,030 --> 00:45:37,410
Sir. Forgive me, sir.

641
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:38,940
It was a mistake, sir.

642
00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:40,670
I will never make
this mistake again, sir.

643
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:42,080
Forgive me, sir.

644
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,940
Why were you waiting
to learn your lesson..

645
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,180
Only after I rearranged your face.

646
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:49,680
Wise men call it 'waste of time'.

647
00:45:49,710 --> 00:45:52,050
He will get bail tomorrow, sir.

648
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:55,580
Who believes in violence?

649
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:57,060
I know, sir.

650
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:58,560
Tiwari believes in violence, sir.

651
00:45:59,050 --> 00:46:01,050
Here you go, Mr. Tiwari.
- Thank you, sir.

652
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:03,030
One more thing, sir.

653
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:06,430
Do I make his back
red like the buffoon..

654
00:46:06,590 --> 00:46:09,270
Or black like that of a buffalo.

655
00:46:09,730 --> 00:46:12,440
50-50.
- Cocktail, sir.

656
00:46:12,530 --> 00:46:14,410
It's going to be fun, sir.

657
00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:16,450
Or sir, how about the same old one?

658
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:19,280
Between two legs..

659
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:21,710
What do you think, Mr. Chaubey?

660
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:24,420
Beautiful.
Between two legs better, sir.

661
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:25,620
Better sir. Go on.

662
00:46:25,710 --> 00:46:27,420
I will tell you everything, sir.

663
00:46:27,450 --> 00:46:29,090
Chaubey.
- Yes, sir.

664
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:30,720
I think he's done.

665
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:32,320
Order some food for him.

666
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:34,400
And.. start the proceedings.

667
00:46:34,590 --> 00:46:37,000
Give it.
- Here.

668
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:38,430
And the rest.

669
00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:40,630
Rascal"

670
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:43,500
Stop. Stop.

671
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,230
Park at the side, come on.

672
00:46:45,430 --> 00:46:46,770
Concentrate.

673
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,270
Name?

674
00:46:48,670 --> 00:46:50,240
Fine him too.

675
00:47:02,450 --> 00:47:04,450
Hey. What's going on here?

676
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:07,190
Don't create a scene for
extracting some extra dough.

677
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:09,360
We give it anyway.

678
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:12,630
Here you go.
Give it to your inspector.

679
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:21,540
Did you get this habit at the brothel?

680
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,210
Better mend your ways.

681
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:27,120
Otherwise if I resort to my ways..

682
00:47:27,210 --> 00:47:28,910
You will lose dearly.

683
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:33,250
Pandey sir, that's the only
way I know to handle the police.

684
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:36,120
It's an old habit,
I can't leave it so soon.

685
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:38,290
I suggest that you get used to it.

686
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:40,060
By the way, the name's Chunni.

687
00:47:40,090 --> 00:47:41,160
Chunni.

688
00:47:41,250 --> 00:47:43,100
That reminds me.

689
00:47:44,090 --> 00:47:45,260
Chaubey.
- Yes, sir.

690
00:47:45,330 --> 00:47:48,270
Is Chunni male or female?

691
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,270
Sir, it's female.

692
00:47:50,430 --> 00:47:52,000
Female.

693
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:55,100
Then why is he pretending to be a man.

694
00:47:55,170 --> 00:47:57,910
Ask him to settle down with someone..

695
00:47:58,970 --> 00:48:00,920
And make him a proud father.

696
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:08,120
Thank you, sir.

697
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:11,020
Thank you, Chunni.

698
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:21,460
And now, the new officer in-charge"

699
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,170
of Bajariya police station Mr.
Chulbul Pandey..

700
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:24,800
Will say a few words.

701
00:48:27,930 --> 00:48:29,380
Chaubey.
- Yes, sir.

702
00:48:29,470 --> 00:48:32,180
Give it.
- Here you go.

703
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:37,050
This is a small gift..

704
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:42,480
For the better future of
the children of our police officers..

705
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:45,030
On behalf of Mr. Chaubey.
- Take it.

706
00:48:45,290 --> 00:48:46,860
Clap!

707
00:48:49,190 --> 00:48:54,000
And all the policemen and Mr. Pandey..

708
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:57,040
Will entertain everyone.

709
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:19,220
"I always do as I please."

710
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:26,200
"Never listen to anyone."

711
00:49:29,430 --> 00:49:32,900
"I always do as I please."

712
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:36,340
"Never listen to anyone."

713
00:49:36,370 --> 00:49:40,180
I never do regular duty."

714
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:42,210
"Sitting in the police station."

715
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:46,190
"Sitting in the police
station on duty."

716
00:49:46,210 --> 00:49:49,220
"Pandeyji's whistling freely."

717
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:53,220
"Sitting in the police
station on duty."

718
00:49:53,250 --> 00:49:56,200
"Pandeyji's whistling freely."

719
00:49:56,220 --> 00:49:59,570
"Pandeyji's whistling freely."

720
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:03,240
"Pandeyji's whistling freely on duty."

721
00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:05,900
"It's a bad habit-"

722
00:50:05,930 --> 00:50:08,240
"Pandeyji's whistling“"

723
00:50:09,270 --> 00:50:12,080
"Pandeyji's whistling“"

724
00:50:12,110 --> 00:50:12,950
Shut up.

725
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:16,250
"Pandeyji's whistling freely."

726
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:35,230
"This police officer has
squeezed all the fun out of Munni."

727
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:40,600
"You'll be left with nothing
if the bird flies away."

728
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:42,400
"If the bird flies away."

729
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:44,280
"If the bird flies away."

730
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:46,910
"If the bird flies away."

731
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:49,250
"I admit.."

732
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:53,280
"I admit your beauty's enthralling."

733
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:58,960
"But PandeyjFs on duty.“

734
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:05,130
"He calls me his life."

735
00:51:05,330 --> 00:51:08,430
"He calls me his sweetheart."

736
00:51:09,130 --> 00:51:12,600
"Always up to some tricks."

737
00:51:12,630 --> 00:51:15,640
"He calls me his princess."

738
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:21,050
"I never get trapped."

739
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:26,560
"I never get trapped."

740
00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:30,360
"You can demand anything you like."

741
00:51:30,450 --> 00:51:32,230
"Sitting in the police station."

742
00:51:59,010 --> 00:52:01,990
"When Mr. Pandey arrives."

743
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:05,520
"That's when the beat plays right."

744
00:52:05,990 --> 00:52:09,190
"Goons and ruffians shiver
in their boots and say."

745
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:12,560
"We'd rather die."

746
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:18,040
"I never do anything
that doesn't suit me."

747
00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:23,340
"I never do anything
that doesn't suit me."

748
00:52:23,370 --> 00:52:27,370
"I attack my enemy unalarmed."

749
00:52:27,410 --> 00:52:29,390
"Sitting in the police station."

750
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:33,350
"Sitting in the police
station on duty."

751
00:52:33,380 --> 00:52:36,260
"Pandeyji's whistling freely."

752
00:52:36,350 --> 00:52:38,590
"It's a bad habit-"

753
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:41,530
"Pandeyji's whistling“"

754
00:52:41,550 --> 00:52:45,230

00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:49,040
"Pandeyji's whistling freely on duty."

756
00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:08,250
Glory to - Baccha Singh.

00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:10,560
Glory to - Baccha Singh.

758
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:12,760
Glory to - Baccha Singh.

759
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:17,120
Your love and enthusiasm
has overwhelmed me.

760
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:20,300
I believe that by making me win..

761
00:53:20,390 --> 00:53:23,140
You're giving me
a chance to serve you.

762
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:25,280
I want to live really long.

763
00:53:25,330 --> 00:53:26,570
Not for myself.

764
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:27,740
But for you.

765
00:53:27,770 --> 00:53:29,470
To serve you.

766
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:32,860
Glory to - Baccha Singh.

767
00:53:32,890 --> 00:53:35,030
He's a crook, sir.

768
00:53:35,430 --> 00:53:37,930
He's giving a speech
on serving the people.

769
00:53:38,190 --> 00:53:41,440
And his goons are threatening
people for their votes.

770
00:53:42,030 --> 00:53:46,500
That means he's got all
the qualities of a politician.

771
00:53:47,540 --> 00:53:48,520
What do you say, Chaubey?

772
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:49,880
What about the country?

773
00:53:50,110 --> 00:53:51,550
Country on death-bed, sir.

774
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:53,410
All kidney fail, sir.

775
00:53:55,780 --> 00:53:57,880
Country on death-bed, sir.

776
00:53:57,910 --> 00:53:59,550
All kidney fail, sir.

777
00:54:02,350 --> 00:54:04,060
No, Chaubey.

778
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:05,860
There are people like us..

779
00:54:05,890 --> 00:54:08,390
Who are providing glucose
and oxygen to the country.

780
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:09,800
Yes, sir.

781
00:54:09,890 --> 00:54:13,570
Mr. Avadh Narayan,
our party head is present amongst us.

782
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:15,070
He will now say a few words.

783
00:54:15,130 --> 00:54:16,440
Here, sir.
- Thank you.

784
00:54:16,870 --> 00:54:18,140
M r. Avad h Narayan.

785
00:54:19,570 --> 00:54:20,910
Who is this?

786
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:22,310
Ladies and Gentlemen.

787
00:54:22,410 --> 00:54:23,580
He's an old sinner, sir.

788
00:54:24,370 --> 00:54:26,880
He's the one who gives
crooks license to be politician.

789
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:28,420
He's Baccha's guru!

790
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:30,980
You've lent your support to the party.

791
00:54:32,450 --> 00:54:33,550
Hey! Sit!

792
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:35,390
Hey! Come here!

793
00:54:36,990 --> 00:54:39,230
If you can't respect
women and children..

794
00:54:39,390 --> 00:54:42,000
At least respect this 'khadi'.

795
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:45,600
Brother.

796
00:54:46,130 --> 00:54:47,400
That's Chulbul Pandey.

797
00:54:48,130 --> 00:54:49,610
He's very arrogant.

798
00:54:50,470 --> 00:54:52,140
I knew that.

799
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:56,910
I've locked horns with
four police officers till now.

800
00:54:57,110 --> 00:54:58,920
I know how to treat people like him.

801
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:01,580
Soon we'll have a
nice meeting with him.

802
00:55:17,030 --> 00:55:17,630
Come.

803
00:55:17,930 --> 00:55:19,300
- Come, sir.
- Oh, God!

804
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:22,300
The generation these
days don't know how to eat.

805
00:55:22,370 --> 00:55:25,040
I still need 12
sweetmeats after dinner.

806
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:28,210
The doctor said, control
your appetite or you'll explode.

807
00:55:28,540 --> 00:55:30,480
I said fine, as you say.

808
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:32,120
Now I eat only 11.

809
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:34,450
- Wow, what control sir.
- Yes.

810
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:36,390
What's that?

811
00:55:37,650 --> 00:55:39,180
Brother.

812
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:42,060
SP Mathur and Chulbul
Pandey are coming this way.

813
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:49,900
Baccha. I've brought your
special guest, Chulbul Pande.

814
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,240
Ramdhani.

815
00:55:55,330 --> 00:55:56,570
Find out whether those
people from Rampun.

816
00:55:56,670 --> 00:55:58,480
Have sent the papers
to the lawyer or not.

817
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:01,350
Otherwise take some men,
barge in his house..

818
00:56:01,370 --> 00:56:03,980
And point the gun on his head.

819
00:56:04,010 --> 00:56:05,990
Pandey, this is Baccha.

820
00:56:06,010 --> 00:56:07,150
It's okay, SP sir.

821
00:56:08,140 --> 00:56:09,920
You've told me his name.

822
00:56:10,010 --> 00:56:13,650
I'm sure he'll understand who I am.

823
00:56:14,350 --> 00:56:15,590
He's new here.

824
00:56:16,690 --> 00:56:18,600
Give him some time.

825
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:22,000
Go ahead.

826
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:24,370
Look, sir.

827
00:56:25,530 --> 00:56:28,200
It's like this,
I always find out who the dancer is..

828
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:29,710
"Before going to the brothel.

829
00:56:31,030 --> 00:56:33,210
How she looks,
how she sways to the beat.

830
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,450
Your full name is Thakur Baccha Lal.

831
00:56:36,710 --> 00:56:39,620
Your father had two more sons.

832
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:43,720
Chunni and Gainda.

833
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:48,390
You started out as
a juicer in this city.

834
00:56:49,550 --> 00:56:51,620
Today you're squeezing the city.

835
00:56:53,060 --> 00:56:57,090
Your father, Mr.
Kesari Lal died of dengue.

836
00:56:57,460 --> 00:57:00,410
And your mother“ died in happiness.

837
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:04,470
You use jasmine oil in your hair.

838
00:57:04,730 --> 00:57:06,740
And you bathe with lifebuoy personnel.

839
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:08,280
Red powder to brush your teeth.

840
00:57:08,370 --> 00:57:12,410
And underwear, Young India no. 90.

841
00:57:14,740 --> 00:57:17,250
The other information
is slightly personal.

842
00:57:17,450 --> 00:57:20,090
You won't be able to hear it,
and I won't be able to say it.

843
00:57:22,450 --> 00:57:24,730
Hey. You're still alive.

844

Is famous singer, Mamta Sharma.
- Forget it. He is just a kid.

846
00:57:34,100 --> 00:57:37,270
What do you call the
animal to whom we throw bones?

847
00:57:37,330 --> 00:57:38,330
Dog.

848
00:57:38,430 --> 00:57:40,280
And the bigger one?

849
00:57:40,770 --> 00:57:42,150
Elephant.

850
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:43,580
So what's better?

851
00:57:44,270 --> 00:57:45,620
Should I butt out?

852
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:49,450
Otherwise"
- You will fill me with holes.

00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:52,660
And what will happen to you?
- Confuse.

854
00:57:52,820 --> 00:57:53,990
How?

855
00:57:54,050 --> 00:57:55,830
How do I breathe and..

856
00:57:55,890 --> 00:57:57,300
"How could it be?"

857
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:59,060
"How could it be?"

858
00:57:59,220 --> 00:58:00,860
"How could it be?"

859
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:02,490
"How could it be?"

860
00:58:02,890 --> 00:58:04,240
"How could it be?"

861
00:58:04,330 --> 00:58:05,860
"How could it be?"

862
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:09,310
"How could you make
chutney without the curry?"

863
00:58:09,330 --> 00:58:12,870
"How could you make
chutney without the curry?"

864
00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:14,870
"How could it be?"

865
00:58:14,970 --> 00:58:16,850
"How could it be?"

866
00:58:16,870 --> 00:58:18,320
"How could it be?"

867
00:58:18,340 --> 00:58:19,880
"How could it be?"

868
00:58:19,980 --> 00:58:23,360
"How could you make
chutney without the curry?"

869
00:58:23,380 --> 00:58:26,920
"How could you make
chutney without the curry?"

870
00:58:27,020 --> 00:58:30,520
"Me and my darling
were flying in a plane."

871
00:58:30,820 --> 00:58:33,990
"Me and my darling
were flying in a plane."

872
00:58:34,020 --> 00:58:37,370
"Plane catch fire and
we fall inside the train."

873
00:58:37,990 --> 00:58:39,340
"How could it be?"

874
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:41,170
"How could it be?"

875
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:44,070
"How could it be?"

876
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:47,940
"How could you make
chutney without the curry?"

877
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:51,380
"How could you make
chutney without the curry?"

878
00:58:51,410 --> 00:58:54,950
"How could you make
chutney without the curry?"

879
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:58,860
"How could you make
chutney without the curry?"

880
00:59:04,950 --> 00:59:07,800
I couldn't endure your humiliation.

881
00:59:07,890 --> 00:59:09,270
Govinde.

882
00:59:09,530 --> 00:59:11,530
Don't get so personal.

883
00:59:13,460 --> 00:59:15,240
It wasn't that bad.

884
00:59:15,270 --> 00:59:17,400
What happened wasn't something small.

885
00:59:18,130 --> 00:59:20,440
Our humiliation means his pride.

886
00:59:21,270 --> 00:59:23,410
And if everyone humiliates us..

887
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:25,040
"Then how will we
thrive in this city.

888
00:59:26,410 --> 00:59:31,090
I didn't say that I've
forgotten what happened.

889
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:35,930
But sometimes you shouldn't
act in haste but use your mind.

890
00:59:36,590 --> 00:59:39,400
That's exactly how I've
been ruling this place.

891
00:59:40,820 --> 00:59:44,100
But Pandey has shown his colours..

892
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:49,300
And I've written
down his name on my list.

893
00:59:50,430 --> 00:59:51,970
- Papa.
- Yes.

894
00:59:52,070 --> 00:59:54,280
What magic did you cast on mother..

895
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:57,110
Which I couldn't get off?

896
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:59,280
At least tell rne where you two met.

897
01:00:01,010 --> 01:00:02,320
Don't bore me.

898
01:00:03,310 --> 01:00:05,290
Fine, don't tell
me if you don't want to.

899
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:07,860
Some other time.

900
01:00:11,350 --> 01:00:12,330
- Papa.
- What is it?

901
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:13,630
Are you asleep?

902
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:15,340
I was saying, if you can't sleep“

903
01:00:15,430 --> 01:00:18,130
and if you're in the
mood to tell me then tell me.

904
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:22,010
You won't stay quiet
as long as I don't tell me.

905
01:00:22,370 --> 01:00:23,440
So listen.

906
01:00:23,970 --> 01:00:25,470
Your mother“ - Mother.

907
01:00:25,940 --> 01:00:28,880
I met your mother
in a marriage function.

908
01:00:29,140 --> 01:00:31,140
We bumped accidentally.

909
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:33,510
The tea-tray fell on me as well.

910
01:00:33,980 --> 01:00:35,320
I was surprised.

911
01:00:35,980 --> 01:00:37,320
I kept staring at her.

912
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:38,990
But nothing happened there.

913
01:00:39,550 --> 01:00:43,660
Then, I talked to your aunt in Patna.

914
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:46,230
She talked to your mother.

915
01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:49,970
And then your mother finally agreed.

916
01:00:52,460 --> 01:00:55,000
And then when she smiled"

917
01:00:55,060 --> 01:00:56,410
Great.

918
01:01:01,370 --> 01:01:02,910
Stupid!

919
01:01:11,150 --> 01:01:12,420
Papa.

920
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:15,160
After the marriage,
you left me with my aunt..

921
01:01:15,250 --> 01:01:16,390
And went to see a movie.

922
01:01:16,490 --> 01:01:17,990
Which movie was it?

923
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:19,930
Julie or Coolie.

924
01:01:20,190 --> 01:01:22,100
Your mother“ - Papa.

925
01:01:22,190 --> 01:01:24,070
Learn to respect your mother.

926
01:01:24,330 --> 01:01:26,360
You're talking to your father.

927
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:27,430
You're upset.

928
01:01:27,530 --> 01:01:29,340
You're angry. Mother was right.

929
01:01:29,370 --> 01:01:30,940
Sleeping with you is no fun at all.

930
01:01:31,030 --> 01:01:32,380
I'm going to sleep with my wife.

931
01:01:35,370 --> 01:01:37,040
What did his mother say?

932
01:01:38,210 --> 01:01:39,710
Is that what she said?

933
01:01:45,350 --> 01:01:47,260
Who is calling at this hour?

934
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:50,620
- Hello.
- Allah! Prajapati Pandey.

935
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:52,390
My prince charming.

936
01:01:52,460 --> 01:01:54,130
You're sleeping all
alone on the roof today.

937
01:01:55,090 --> 01:01:58,070
Aasma. Who are you talking to?

938
01:01:58,730 --> 01:02:00,540
Allah! My husband's back.

939
01:02:00,730 --> 01:02:03,140
- He's very dangerous.
- Hello. Hello.

940
01:02:03,230 --> 01:02:05,140
Better cover yourself with a blanket.

941
01:02:05,570 --> 01:02:08,410
Aasma, you will never mend your ways.

942
01:02:08,470 --> 01:02:10,450
- Hello.
- I'm disconnecting.

943
01:02:11,540 --> 01:02:12,990
Hello. Hello, Aasma.

944
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:13,750
Aasma.

945
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:16,080
Surprising, Pandey.

946
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:19,320
Strange.

947
01:02:21,750 --> 01:02:23,420
- Rajjo.
- Yes.

948
01:02:23,490 --> 01:02:25,060
Where's my watch, Rajjo?

949
01:02:34,660 --> 01:02:37,110
Rajjo. Where's my belt?

950
01:02:46,310 --> 01:02:48,790
Rajjo. Where's the comb?

951
01:02:52,580 --> 01:02:53,790
Oh.

952
01:02:56,250 --> 01:02:57,460
Listen.

953
01:03:00,590 --> 01:03:03,500
You're my wife, not a slave.

954
01:03:04,290 --> 01:03:08,800
Whenever I get assertive,
you should rebel. Get it.

955
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:14,680
Come on, let me leave.

956
01:03:17,270 --> 01:03:18,510
Give it.

957
01:03:19,810 --> 01:03:21,150
Give it.

958
01:03:22,310 --> 01:03:24,150
Fine, I'll take it myself.

959
01:03:25,310 --> 01:03:26,490
One more.

960
01:03:28,820 --> 01:03:30,200
One more.

961
01:03:34,190 --> 01:03:36,830
I'll set a few criminals free today.

962
01:03:43,470 --> 01:03:46,640
Uncle. Uncle, no need to walk.

963
01:03:46,670 --> 01:03:49,170
- This car's for you.
- Who are you?

964
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:51,410
We're members of the 'Old
People Service Committee'.

965
01:03:51,510 --> 01:03:52,680
We look after old man.

966
01:03:52,740 --> 01:03:54,310
- Come on.
- No, I am fine.

967
01:03:54,340 --> 01:03:55,550
Come on, uncle.

968
01:03:55,650 --> 01:03:56,850
Come on.

969
01:03:57,310 --> 01:03:58,490
I said come on.

970
01:03:59,180 --> 01:04:00,490
What is this insolence?

971
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:02,250
Uncle, this is the way I do service.

972
01:04:03,150 --> 01:04:04,260
Sit confortably.

973
01:04:04,350 --> 01:04:05,230
We'll have a light conversation"

974
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:06,490
and then I will drop you home.

975
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:07,760
What do you mean?

976
01:04:09,590 --> 01:04:11,700
Uncle, your son.

977
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:14,530
Mr. Chulbul Pandey.

978
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:18,700
He's terrorized the city.

979
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:24,240
And respected people
like us don't like this.

980
01:04:26,210 --> 01:04:31,390
See, people who don't have a family..

981
01:04:31,450 --> 01:04:33,450
Or don't love their
family do such things.

982
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:36,250
Get it.

983
01:04:44,190 --> 01:04:45,700
I am not satisfied.

984
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:49,570
But what to do?

985
01:04:49,630 --> 01:04:51,240
Brother has tied my hands.

986
01:04:51,700 --> 01:04:55,910
Baccha. I am his younger brother.

987
01:04:57,570 --> 01:04:58,640
Genda.

988
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:04,220
Come on, let's go.

989
01:05:17,260 --> 01:05:19,260
What was the urgency, papa?

990
01:05:19,460 --> 01:05:20,600
I was on duty.

991
01:05:20,630 --> 01:05:23,410
You're not the only one
in the police department.

992
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:26,280
There are other people working there.

993
01:05:26,340 --> 01:05:28,410
Papa. What's wrong?

994
01:05:29,010 --> 01:05:31,420
Our family has finally stablized.

995
01:05:32,110 --> 01:05:33,310
Everything's going fine.

996
01:05:33,780 --> 01:05:36,280
Soon we'll hear the
giggles of children.

997
01:05:37,450 --> 01:05:41,290
Now, goons like Baccha
shouldn't ruin our peace.

998
01:05:42,090 --> 01:05:43,830
Think about what I am saying.

999
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:56,840
- Hello.
- Hello.

1000
01:05:56,930 --> 01:05:59,110
Is the money transferred?
- Yes, let me see.

1001
01:06:02,810 --> 01:06:04,150
Yes, it is.

1002
01:06:04,770 --> 01:06:06,450
The money's transferred
quickly this time.

1003
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:07,820
It used to take 5 days earlier.

1004
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:09,190
Its been transferred through Zoom.com.

1005
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:11,050
The money's transferred
within 24 hours.

1006
01:06:12,150 --> 01:06:14,460
- Great. Thank you.
- Okay.

1007
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:22,160
You're walking really
carefully these days.

1008
01:06:22,830 --> 01:06:23,830
Let me go.

1009
01:06:23,860 --> 01:06:26,030
Don't get so restless. I don't bite.

1010
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:29,310
I heard that your family's
thinking about your marriage.

1011
01:06:30,330 --> 01:06:32,840
I've dreamt of making you my queen..

1012
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:34,810
And you're looking
for a another prince charming.

1013
01:06:35,340 --> 01:06:37,080
I swear I will do something drastic.

1014
01:06:37,170 --> 01:06:38,520
Let of my hand.

1015
01:06:43,380 --> 01:06:44,820
Hurry UP-

1016
01:06:45,150 --> 01:06:46,920
The chain's acting up.

1017
01:06:48,850 --> 01:06:51,020
What's wrong, dear? You look worried.

1018
01:06:51,390 --> 01:06:52,490
Nothing, grandpa.

1019
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:54,500
There are too many
mad dogs in the city.

1020
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:57,000
I wonder who will
do something about it.

1021
01:06:57,490 --> 01:07:01,240
I spent my life sewing this country"

1022
01:07:01,330 --> 01:07:04,040
and it's getting difficult
for me to even breathe here now.

1023
01:07:04,070 --> 01:07:06,550
Is this how I am being
repaid for my sacrifice?

1024
01:07:06,770 --> 01:07:08,510
Listen“ - Let me speak.

1025
01:07:09,210 --> 01:07:11,010
This is my granddaughter Anjali.

1026
01:07:11,210 --> 01:07:12,780
She's soon to get married.

1027
01:07:12,910 --> 01:07:16,120
And a goon has
threatened to abduct her.

1028
01:07:16,210 --> 01:07:18,520
And his name is Genda.

1029
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:21,450
And he's the MLA Baccha's brother.

1030
01:07:21,550 --> 01:07:23,530
- I..
- No ifs and buts.

1031
01:07:23,550 --> 01:07:26,030
Take down my FIR.

1032
01:07:26,060 --> 01:07:27,470
Respected gentlemen.

1033
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:31,570
I apologise for all
that you had to suffer.

1034
01:07:34,460 --> 01:07:36,970
By the way,
which struggle did you take part in?

1035
01:07:37,070 --> 01:07:38,240
The freedom struggle.

1036
01:07:38,270 --> 01:07:40,940
So, go home.

1037
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:45,250
Sit on your rocking chair
and arrange for the marriage.

1038
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:50,080
Your struggle came
in handy to you and me too.

1039
01:07:57,890 --> 01:07:59,300
Call the bride.

1040
01:08:03,930 --> 01:08:05,300
Genda.

1041
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:06,930
Anjali.

1042
01:08:38,260 --> 01:08:39,540
What?

1043
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:42,140
So, master? Why did you stop playing?

1044
01:08:42,430 --> 01:08:44,970
The real lover's here for his bride.

1045
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:47,440
- Play.
- Play you rascals.

1046
01:08:51,170 --> 01:08:53,050
Tie the knot.

1047
01:08:53,140 --> 01:08:55,350
And ask the groom to
stay away from the bride.

1048
01:08:55,450 --> 01:08:58,050
The bride's sweetheart
is here for her.

1049
01:09:02,390 --> 01:09:03,960
Why are you here?

1050
01:09:04,050 --> 01:09:06,120
Why? What do you want?

1051
01:09:06,160 --> 01:09:07,500
Promise.

1052
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:10,500
Didn't I promise you that
I will abduct your granddaughter?

1053
01:09:10,530 --> 01:09:12,340
I beg you.

1054
01:09:12,360 --> 01:09:13,670
Move aside old man.

1055
01:09:14,330 --> 01:09:15,670
- Move!
- Grandpa.

1056
01:09:15,900 --> 01:09:17,500
Don't make me kill you.

1057
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:25,010
- Hey, leave her.
- Leave me.

1058
01:09:25,070 --> 01:09:29,020
I do the hard work
and you take the reward.

1059
01:09:29,210 --> 01:09:30,210
You think it's that easy.

1060
01:09:30,310 --> 01:09:31,690
Leave me. Let go of my son.

1061
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:35,220
Someone save her.

1062
01:09:36,990 --> 01:09:40,660
If anyone interferes there
will make a massacre here.

1063
01:09:42,660 --> 01:09:44,190
Let me go. Grandpa.

1064
01:09:44,230 --> 01:09:46,500
- Let's go, sweetheart.
- Leave me.

1065
01:10:04,410 --> 01:10:06,690
Look who is here?

1066
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:11,560
From Bajariya Police Station,
Chulbul Pandey.

1067
01:10:12,050 --> 01:10:13,230
Supercop.

1068
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:17,230
Pandey, you know who I am.

1069
01:10:18,060 --> 01:10:19,630
I am Baccha's brother.

1070
01:10:20,130 --> 01:10:22,110
He rules the city.

1071
01:10:22,430 --> 01:10:29,710
I am the witness,
the lawyer and the judge here.

1072
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:32,240
Isn't he speaking too much?

1073
01:10:32,310 --> 01:10:37,280
Officers like you bathe my buffaloes.

1074
01:10:37,710 --> 01:10:40,490
I think your father
didn't explain you properly.

1075
01:10:41,750 --> 01:10:43,750
It's my fault.

1076
01:10:44,420 --> 01:10:46,590
I behaved myself.

1077
01:10:47,420 --> 01:10:49,990
If I had slapped him a few times"

1078
01:10:50,090 --> 01:10:51,630
you would've received
the right message.

1079
01:10:52,060 --> 01:10:54,670
I think brother Genda's
getting to emotional.

1080
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:58,140
He's counting his last days"

1081
01:10:58,230 --> 01:11:01,610
why do you want him
to see your dead body.

1082
01:11:02,310 --> 01:11:04,110
I will take this girl along.

1083
01:11:04,140 --> 01:11:05,590
And right before your eyes.

1084
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:09,690
Now?

1085
01:11:10,180 --> 01:11:11,320
Shall I press the trigger?

1086
01:11:39,510 --> 01:11:41,150
Surprising, Genda.

1087
01:11:41,710 --> 01:11:43,380
You will slap my father.

1088
01:11:43,810 --> 01:11:45,450
Abduct the girl.

1089
01:11:46,150 --> 01:11:49,490
There's a police station, police.
And there's me.

1090
01:11:49,820 --> 01:11:51,320
What did you get out it?

1091
01:11:52,390 --> 01:11:53,700
Congratulations for your marriage.

1092
01:11:55,630 --> 01:11:57,130
Thank you.

1093
01:11:57,390 --> 01:11:58,500
See you.

1094
01:12:02,630 --> 01:12:03,700
Now!

1095
01:12:14,730 --> 01:12:26,730
Resync By Zambronk_lah.

1096
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:18,010
Wait here.

1097
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:28,910
Papa. You've been
angry for two days now..

1098
01:14:29,410 --> 01:14:31,320
And made me worried.

1099
01:14:31,810 --> 01:14:33,290
How would you have felt
if they had abducted the girl..

1100
01:14:33,340 --> 01:14:35,250
From her marriage
right in front of me?

1101
01:14:36,910 --> 01:14:39,090
Papa, I don't like hurting you.

1102
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:42,930
But I cannot guarantee
of keeping you happy..

1103
01:14:42,950 --> 01:14:44,590
While doing my duty.

1104
01:14:47,020 --> 01:14:49,260
Yes. If you want.

1105
01:14:52,430 --> 01:14:54,310
Then I can quit the police force.

1106
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:00,280
See you.

1107
01:15:52,660 --> 01:15:54,660
- What's going on, Mr. Mathur?
- Baccha.

1108
01:15:54,890 --> 01:15:56,170
What's going on?

1109
01:15:56,990 --> 01:15:59,030
Whatever happened with
my brother is plain hooliganism"

1110
01:15:59,100 --> 01:16:00,570
and not legal action.

1111
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,270
If someone commits a
crime or upholds the law..

1112
01:16:03,330 --> 01:16:04,940
"Then arrest him.

1113
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:07,250
The court's there to punish him.

1114
01:16:08,340 --> 01:16:10,410
You think you can punish him,
kill him.

1115
01:16:11,410 --> 01:16:13,010
My brother has been murdered“

1116
01:16:13,080 --> 01:16:14,250
and it will be accounted for.
- Of course.

1117
01:16:15,050 --> 01:16:16,290
Of course, Baccha.

1118
01:16:16,680 --> 01:16:18,350
I am not denying it.

1119
01:16:18,420 --> 01:16:21,690
And I will discuss this incident
with the higher officials.

1120
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:22,620
It will be investigated.

1121
01:16:22,690 --> 01:16:25,960
I didn't come here pleading
for investigation or probes.

1122
01:16:27,590 --> 01:16:30,400
I came here to tell
you that this is war.

1123
01:16:31,430 --> 01:16:35,210
Pandey will now realise
that this is Kanpur not Lalganj.

1124
01:16:35,530 --> 01:16:37,270
And I am Baccha Singh, not Chedi.

1125
01:16:37,370 --> 01:16:38,140
Baccha Singh

1126
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:39,540
- Ba..
- Enough!

1127
01:16:40,570 --> 01:16:41,980
Let's go.

1128
01:16:54,650 --> 01:16:56,060
Bacchal

1129
01:17:06,260 --> 01:17:09,400
They say think of someone
and if he appears before you..

1130
01:17:09,470 --> 01:17:11,070
He's blessed with a long life.

1131
01:17:12,040 --> 01:17:15,350
But if I think of someone
and he appears before me..

1132
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:17,110
"Then he doesn't live for long.

1133
01:17:18,780 --> 01:17:20,450
Start counting your days, Pandey.

1134
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:23,190
You're going through a bad phase"

1135
01:17:24,150 --> 01:17:25,890
and you're asking
me to count the days.

1136
01:17:26,180 --> 01:17:27,990
You're a big player, aren't you?

1137
01:17:28,450 --> 01:17:30,360
So I will play a bigger game with you.

1138
01:17:31,960 --> 01:17:33,800
I will make your plight such that.

1139
01:17:33,820 --> 01:17:38,200
You will regret that
you were transferred to Kanpur.

1140
01:17:40,130 --> 01:17:42,340
Here's a small advice.

1141
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:45,140
Drop that thought.

1142
01:17:46,370 --> 01:17:48,820
Whether I do or not"

1143
01:17:50,010 --> 01:17:55,150
"but you will surely regret
I was transferred to Kanpur.

1144
01:17:59,420 --> 01:18:02,760
This is your friend Jugal
Sharma from 97.4 Kanpur.

1145
01:18:02,820 --> 01:18:04,820
Today we will talk about
fearless police officer..

1146
01:18:04,860 --> 01:18:06,860
Chulbul Pandey,
alias Robin Hood Pandey.

1147
01:18:07,260 --> 01:18:10,830
His arrival has filled the
air of Kanpur with new freshness.

1148
01:18:11,330 --> 01:18:13,210
Goons and ruffians are in a jeopardy"

1149
01:18:13,260 --> 01:18:15,330
and evil-doers
are counting their days.

1150
01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:18,180
For the first time,
people believe in a police officer..

1151
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:19,340
More than themselves.

1152
01:18:19,370 --> 01:18:20,510
Papa, eat your dinner.

1153
01:18:20,770 --> 01:18:22,110
We've a call, Ms. Prabha and..

1154
01:18:22,170 --> 01:18:24,280
"She would like to say
something about Chulbul Pandey.

1155
01:18:25,010 --> 01:18:26,210
Yes, Ms. Prabha. Please go ahead.

1156
01:18:26,840 --> 01:18:28,290
Finish all the bread.

1157
01:18:28,750 --> 01:18:31,120
- These days you eat less.
- Okay.

1158
01:18:31,180 --> 01:18:33,020
Go get some more bread.

1159
01:18:33,450 --> 01:18:34,360
Right away.

1160
01:18:34,380 --> 01:18:38,200
And people call him Chulbul
Pandey alias Kung-fu Pandey.

1161
01:18:43,860 --> 01:18:45,200
Tell me one thing.

1162
01:18:45,530 --> 01:18:47,530
Do you ever do anything?

1163
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:49,440
You never sleep?

1164
01:18:51,970 --> 01:18:55,310
Every woman in the
world regrets that..

1165
01:18:55,370 --> 01:18:57,550
"Their husband fall
asleep after a tired day.

1166
01:18:58,440 --> 01:19:01,790
And you're the first
wife who regrets"

1167
01:19:01,880 --> 01:19:03,880
"that her husband never sleeps.

1168
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:08,560
Better mend your ways, Mr. Pandey.

1169
01:19:08,890 --> 01:19:09,990
You're soon to be a father.

1170
01:19:10,550 --> 01:19:12,060
And what if I don't?

1171
01:19:12,090 --> 01:19:14,570
Then I will leave you and go away,
to my father.

1172
01:19:32,340 --> 01:19:35,520
Your father sacrificed
his life for your happiness"

1173
01:19:36,850 --> 01:19:39,090
so will you repay him with tears?

1174
01:19:41,890 --> 01:19:43,960
Surprising, Mrs. Pandey.

1175
01:19:57,930 --> 01:20:03,250
"Love has bound us in this union."

1176
01:20:03,740 --> 01:20:08,780
"My heart beats just for you."

1177
01:20:09,250 --> 01:20:14,660
"My heart skips a beat."

1178
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:20,030
"When you said this."

1179
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:25,930
"I will spend my
entire life with you."

1180
01:20:26,160 --> 01:20:31,040
"I've made this promise to Lord."

1181
01:20:33,100 --> 01:20:38,710
"Love has created this union."

1182
01:20:38,940 --> 01:20:44,150
"My heart beats just for you."

1183
01:21:13,740 --> 01:21:17,420
"When your eyes.."

1184
01:21:19,320 --> 01:21:23,320
"Don't talk to me."

1185
01:21:24,150 --> 01:21:31,200
"I swear feel lifeless."

1186
01:21:33,100 --> 01:21:36,840
"How can you.."

1187
01:21:39,070 --> 01:21:42,950
"Feel lifeless."

1188
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:50,520
"I wouldn't have existed without you."

1189
01:21:52,350 --> 01:21:54,960
"You are me are one."

1190
01:21:55,190 --> 01:21:57,760
"I'm in love with you."

1191
01:21:58,020 --> 01:22:01,030
"It will keep growing."

1192
01:22:01,360 --> 01:22:07,210
"I've promised that to Lord."

1193
01:22:07,930 --> 01:22:13,310
"Love has created this union."

1194
01:22:13,470 --> 01:22:19,220
"My heart beats just for you."

1195
01:22:36,890 --> 01:22:41,170
"My life-long companion."

1196
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:46,470
"I'm the light and you're the lamp."

1197
01:22:48,910 --> 01:22:54,510
"Our future looks bright."

1198
01:22:56,910 --> 01:23:06,530
"Even the stars are out..
to admire my sweetheart."

1199
01:23:08,430 --> 01:23:14,340
"Let me take you in my arms,
save you from them."

1200
01:23:15,830 --> 01:23:18,280
"Let go."

1201
01:23:18,440 --> 01:23:21,280
"Come closer."

1202
01:23:21,340 --> 01:23:24,510
"I admit defeat."

1203
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:31,280
"I promised that to Lord."

1204
01:23:33,320 --> 01:23:35,160
Mrs. Pandey,
continue your medications"

1205
01:23:35,220 --> 01:23:36,960
and come back again in
a month for another check-up.

1206
01:23:36,990 --> 01:23:38,190
Yes.

1207
01:23:38,360 --> 01:23:41,460
Mr. Pandey,
you need to take care of her now.

1208
01:23:43,490 --> 01:23:44,970
That reminds me.

1209
01:23:45,130 --> 01:23:48,200
As my personal friend and doctor..

1210
01:23:48,300 --> 01:23:50,210
I want to ask you a question.

1211
01:23:50,300 --> 01:23:51,470
Go ahead.

1212
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:55,070
Anyway'-

1213
01:24:01,010 --> 01:24:02,320
How long?

1214
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:04,190
Seven months.

1215
01:24:05,420 --> 01:24:07,260
Do you want to ask anything else?

1216
01:24:08,650 --> 01:24:10,260
Are you sure?

1217
01:24:14,190 --> 01:24:15,530
Are you satisfied now?

1218
01:24:15,590 --> 01:24:16,590
Shall we go?

1219
01:24:16,660 --> 01:24:18,330
We were worried for no reason.

1220
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:19,900
- Let's go.
- Thank you, doctor.

1221
01:24:20,260 --> 01:24:22,330
We'll take your leave.
- Okay, Mr. Pandey.

1222
01:24:26,040 --> 01:24:27,280
You're holding me so tight.

1223
01:24:27,340 --> 01:24:29,180
Are you feeling cold
or will you fall down?

1224
01:24:29,910 --> 01:24:31,180
What did the doctor say?

1225
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:32,390
It's good news.

1226
01:24:32,440 --> 01:24:34,050
Let's go home and I will tell you.

1227
01:24:34,110 --> 01:24:36,350
- Chulbul.
- Yes, sir.

1228
01:24:37,050 --> 01:24:39,030
- Hello, Mr. Mathur.
- Bless you, dear.

1229
01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:41,020
I need to talk to you.

1230
01:24:45,020 --> 01:24:46,090
Yes, sir.

1231
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:50,530
Chulbul. I've put in
a request for your transfer.

1232
01:24:52,460 --> 01:24:53,530
Why?

1233
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:57,940
Look. I know scoundrels like Baccha.

1234
01:24:58,130 --> 01:25:00,440
They are lowly people.

1235
01:25:00,870 --> 01:25:02,280
They can do anything.

1236
01:25:02,470 --> 01:25:04,010
They don't think.

1237
01:25:04,440 --> 01:25:05,940
You're a family man.

1238
01:25:06,380 --> 01:25:07,950
You've a father, a brother.

1239
01:25:07,980 --> 01:25:09,960
And soon you will become a father.

1240
01:25:10,210 --> 01:25:11,320
Just think.

1241
01:25:11,480 --> 01:25:12,980
If anything happens to you..

1242
01:25:13,150 --> 01:25:14,630
"What will happen
to these poor souls?

1243
01:25:16,550 --> 01:25:18,120
Do you understand?

1244
01:25:24,900 --> 01:25:26,340
Thank you.

1245
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:28,240
I will think about it.

1246
01:25:30,470 --> 01:25:32,640
Look. I am taking
my medicines one time.

1247
01:25:38,140 --> 01:25:39,310
Papa.

1248
01:25:40,010 --> 01:25:41,420
- You're back, Chulbul.
- Yes.

1249
01:25:41,650 --> 01:25:46,590
Papa, please sign here and here.

1250
01:25:47,350 --> 01:25:48,330
What is this, Chulbul?

1251
01:25:48,350 --> 01:25:49,390
Sign it.

1252
01:25:52,160 --> 01:25:53,190
What is this?

1253
01:25:53,660 --> 01:25:58,000
Papa, I got myself insured.

1254
01:25:58,230 --> 01:26:01,210
- What?
- I got myself insured.

1255
01:26:01,260 --> 01:26:02,170
Insurance?

1256
01:26:02,230 --> 01:26:03,180
Yes, Papa-

1257
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:04,340
And you're the nominee.

1258
01:26:04,900 --> 01:26:06,380
What are you thinking, son?

1259
01:26:06,670 --> 01:26:08,170
I'm a police officer.

1260
01:26:09,570 --> 01:26:11,110
Anything can happen at anytime.

1261
01:26:11,170 --> 01:26:13,420
Why do you think like that?

1262
01:26:14,110 --> 01:26:15,680
Stop worrying about me.

1263
01:26:15,950 --> 01:26:17,360
Don't consider me your weakness.

1264
01:26:17,580 --> 01:26:20,030
Your father's still strong enough..

1265
01:26:20,050 --> 01:26:22,590
To deal with 100 such Bacchas.

1266
01:26:23,690 --> 01:26:26,360
Papa, wasn't that a little too much?

1267
01:26:26,390 --> 01:26:28,230
Fine.

1268
01:26:28,460 --> 01:26:31,200
You can deal with
the ones that escape me.

1269
01:26:36,630 --> 01:26:40,100
If mother had seen this,
it would've been really nice.

1270
01:26:41,040 --> 01:26:42,450
What did you say?
- You're getting me wrong.

1271
01:26:42,540 --> 01:26:44,110
What did you say?
- I am not praising Chulbul Pandey.

1272
01:26:44,210 --> 01:26:45,380
Mistake.

1273
01:26:45,710 --> 01:26:47,280
- I will deal with you.
- Useless.

1274
01:26:49,150 --> 01:26:50,390
Get up.

1275
01:26:55,320 --> 01:26:56,420
Rascal.

1276
01:26:56,490 --> 01:26:59,730
You should behave properly
with the party-workers.

1277
01:26:59,990 --> 01:27:01,560
After all,
they work for us day and night..

1278
01:27:01,590 --> 01:27:03,660
And have some expectations with us.

1279
01:27:04,230 --> 01:27:06,260
Baccha Singh, in politics"

1280
01:27:06,330 --> 01:27:09,500
"you've to think beyond
happiness and sorrows. - I see.

1281
01:27:10,400 --> 01:27:12,350
My brother died just a few days ago“

1282
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:15,010
and I am here to attend the meeting.

1283
01:27:15,070 --> 01:27:16,240
What else do you want me to do?

1284
01:27:16,270 --> 01:27:20,080
And that lowly party-worker
was praising Pandey.

1285
01:27:20,140 --> 01:27:22,120
Baccha Singh,
why don't you understand?

1286
01:27:22,280 --> 01:27:25,590
The red carpefs
being laid out for you.

1287
01:27:25,980 --> 01:27:28,520
It's time to reap the harvest.

1288
01:27:28,590 --> 01:27:30,160
Control yourself.

1289
01:27:30,250 --> 01:27:31,430
What do I do?

1290
01:27:32,460 --> 01:27:34,990
Call the media and
praise Pandey's actions.

1291
01:27:35,260 --> 01:27:38,640
And say that my brother
was a rascal and a pervert.

1292
01:27:39,660 --> 01:27:44,670
And say that he deserved this
for his lowly and cheap actions!

1293
01:27:45,270 --> 01:27:46,510
Should I say that?

1294
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:47,640
Say it.

1295
01:27:48,510 --> 01:27:51,010
Say that to the media.

1296
01:28:03,620 --> 01:28:07,030
I fully support the police's actions.

1297
01:28:09,260 --> 01:28:12,370
If any goon behaves
like this with a girl..

1298
01:28:12,430 --> 01:28:14,530
Then he should
face such consequences.

1299
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:18,710
Even if he's the MP“, MLA or CM's son.

1300
01:28:20,200 --> 01:28:25,590
He was my brother, and I feel
ashamed and unfortunate about it.

1301
01:28:26,240 --> 01:28:28,620
So that means you're saying Mr.
Pandey was right.

1302
01:28:28,710 --> 01:28:30,280
Yes. Of course.

1303
01:28:30,380 --> 01:28:31,550
Definitely.

1304
01:28:31,950 --> 01:28:35,230
I want to congratulate
Pandey for his actions.

1305
01:28:35,290 --> 01:28:38,130
Are you giving this statement
for political mileage?

1306
01:28:40,390 --> 01:28:41,300
Rascal!

1307
01:28:41,390 --> 01:28:42,560
Just because I gave you some
respect and said a few words..

1308
01:28:42,630 --> 01:28:43,730
You're taking advantage of it.

1309
01:28:43,960 --> 01:28:45,060
What are you doing?

1310
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:47,970
What are you doing?

1311
01:28:48,300 --> 01:28:49,500
Stop it.

1312
01:28:51,070 --> 01:28:52,270
Baccha sir.

1313
01:28:52,740 --> 01:28:56,580
Not for political mileage,
I'm doing it for my peace of mind.

1314
01:28:56,610 --> 01:28:58,280
Thank you. Go.

1315
01:29:02,750 --> 01:29:06,750
Hey. Tea for me and tiger
biscuit for Chulbul sir.

1316
01:29:09,320 --> 01:29:11,090
Sir. Baccha.

1317
01:29:11,690 --> 01:29:15,800
Pandey. Just a few more days.

1318
01:29:16,690 --> 01:29:19,040
Once the elections are over,
after that"

1319
01:29:19,860 --> 01:29:23,970
I will settle your score properly.

1320
01:29:24,770 --> 01:29:26,810
Let me give you a free advice.

1321
01:29:27,700 --> 01:29:29,120
I've already insured myself.

1322
01:29:30,040 --> 01:29:32,080
You should do it too.

1323
01:29:39,150 --> 01:29:40,650
You too Chaubey.

1324
01:29:40,720 --> 01:29:42,920
You'll be useful even after you die.
- Yes, sir.

1325
01:29:45,220 --> 01:29:46,130
By the way, what did he want?

1326
01:29:46,220 --> 01:29:47,290
Two slaps, sir.

1327
01:30:00,970 --> 01:30:02,780
I don't understand this game now.

1328
01:30:02,840 --> 01:30:05,010
A lowly police officer
kills my brother..

1329
01:30:05,080 --> 01:30:06,750
And we give statements praising him.

1330
01:30:06,810 --> 01:30:09,090
If this is what we
need to do for politics.

1331
01:30:09,110 --> 01:30:10,420
"Then I cannot do it!

1332
01:30:10,650 --> 01:30:11,750
I cannot do it!

1333
01:30:18,190 --> 01:30:19,760
I am not saying anything.

1334
01:30:19,790 --> 01:30:21,670
And what can I say?

1335
01:30:21,760 --> 01:30:23,430
Because I don't understand a thing.

1336
01:30:32,370 --> 01:30:34,110
Why do you look worried?

1337
01:30:35,310 --> 01:30:36,680
What do I say, papa?

1338
01:30:38,040 --> 01:30:40,110
I dreamt about my father.

1339
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:43,690
What did he say?
- He didn't say a word.

1340
01:30:44,680 --> 01:30:46,290
He was running after
you with a stick"

1341
01:30:46,350 --> 01:30:47,450
"but he thrashed me.

1342
01:30:48,450 --> 01:30:49,830
Why did he thrash you?

1343
01:30:50,790 --> 01:30:52,460
Because I interfered to save you.

1344
01:30:53,060 --> 01:30:55,870
By the way,
I am happy that you were safe.

1345
01:30:59,960 --> 01:31:01,310
What are you thinking now?

1346
01:31:03,400 --> 01:31:07,910
I always dreamt that
someday you will respect me.

1347
01:31:09,810 --> 01:31:12,150
And now you respect
me even in your dreams.

1348
01:31:13,480 --> 01:31:14,820
All thanks to God.

1349
01:31:19,980 --> 01:31:21,490
I love you, Papa-

1350
01:31:27,890 --> 01:31:29,770
5 kilos of flour.

1351
01:31:29,830 --> 01:31:31,270
And..Anything else?

1352
01:31:31,330 --> 01:31:33,930
5 litres of sugar as well.
- Yes.

1353
01:31:34,430 --> 01:31:37,000
5 litres of su..

1354
01:31:38,870 --> 01:31:42,510
We sell sugar in kilos not litres.

1355
01:31:42,940 --> 01:31:45,850
Guess your wife hasn't returned yet.

1356
01:31:45,910 --> 01:31:48,010
You're missing her.

1357
01:31:48,450 --> 01:31:49,890
I don't think about her now.

1358
01:31:50,180 --> 01:31:52,060
Now all I think about now
is who returned from the jungle.

1359
01:31:52,120 --> 01:31:54,120
Jungle" - Put it in my account.

1360
01:31:55,250 --> 01:31:56,360
Listen.

1361
01:31:56,390 --> 01:32:00,270
Pray to Hanuman and all
your problems will be solved.

1362
01:32:04,530 --> 01:32:05,910
Whose bag is this?

1363
01:32:06,960 --> 01:32:07,940
- Sister-i n-law.
- Yes.

1364
01:32:08,030 --> 01:32:10,100
- Who's here?
- Remember, I told you..

1365
01:32:10,200 --> 01:32:11,910
That my aunt's
daughter Shobha's coming.

1366
01:32:11,970 --> 01:32:12,910
I see.

1367
01:32:12,970 --> 01:32:14,920
Sister-in-law, I am really hungry.
Serve the food quickly.

1368
01:32:14,970 --> 01:32:16,970
Yes, sit clown.

1369
01:32:18,140 --> 01:32:19,880
- Shobha.
- Yes, sister.

1370
01:32:19,940 --> 01:32:21,550
Give him something to eat, please.

1371
01:32:35,060 --> 01:32:36,500
Sister-in-law. Just a minute.

1372
01:32:38,300 --> 01:32:42,510
Your aunt's daughter looks
a lot like Nirmala, doesn't she?

1373
01:32:42,570 --> 01:32:44,170
Shobha? No?

1374
01:32:44,400 --> 01:32:46,010
Nirmala's complexion is wheatish"

1375
01:32:46,070 --> 01:32:47,570
and she also has big eyes.

1376
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:49,480
Yes, I see.

1377
01:33:00,080 --> 01:33:01,960
You haven't called in a month.

1378
01:33:03,250 --> 01:33:04,600
Are you in love with someone else?

1379
01:33:06,260 --> 01:33:07,600
Do you visit the brothel?

1380
01:33:08,990 --> 01:33:10,370
Nirmala.

1381
01:33:39,120 --> 01:33:40,120
Brother.

1382
01:33:40,160 --> 01:33:41,640
Brother, open the door.

1383
01:33:42,330 --> 01:33:44,170
Brother, open the door.

1384
01:33:45,400 --> 01:33:48,140
How did you know
that I just fell asleep?

1385
01:33:48,900 --> 01:33:50,170
Open the door.

1386
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:52,310
Brother.

1387
01:33:53,900 --> 01:33:54,910
Go ahead.

1388
01:33:54,970 --> 01:33:57,880
Brother, I returned from the jungle?

1389
01:34:00,210 --> 01:34:02,520
Any problems on the way?
- No, brother.

1390
01:34:03,010 --> 01:34:04,580
- So now?
- Good night.

1391
01:34:06,350 --> 01:34:08,160
Did you tell papa?

1392
01:34:11,150 --> 01:34:12,390
Goodnight.

1393
01:34:15,890 --> 01:34:16,890
Papa.

1394
01:34:20,260 --> 01:34:22,210
Why come visit me for two days?

1395
01:34:23,170 --> 01:34:25,110
Just to trouble me.

1396
01:34:25,670 --> 01:34:27,440
And why train to be a teacher?

1397
01:34:28,340 --> 01:34:30,010
After the training I will get a job.

1398
01:34:30,070 --> 01:34:31,280
And earn money.

1399
01:34:31,510 --> 01:34:32,950
We'll soon have children.

1400
01:34:33,010 --> 01:34:35,110
Their education, future..

1401
01:34:35,180 --> 01:34:36,520
We have to look after that.

1402
01:34:37,080 --> 01:34:38,290
I am there for that.

1403
01:34:38,520 --> 01:34:40,520
I don't deny that.

1404
01:34:41,050 --> 01:34:45,470
I want you to just
love me and I will work.

1405
01:34:49,360 --> 01:34:51,270
- Look after yourself.
- Okay.

1406
01:35:03,640 --> 01:35:06,090
My job's sending
people to the hospital“

1407
01:35:06,140 --> 01:35:08,590
"but I will take you
to the hospital myself.

1408
01:35:09,080 --> 01:35:10,250
Do one thing.

1409
01:35:10,310 --> 01:35:13,420
Send me a picture
of yours through MMS.

1410
01:35:15,050 --> 01:35:16,390
Okay, catch you later.

1411
01:35:16,420 --> 01:35:18,300
Makkhi's just flown into the station.

1412
01:35:18,390 --> 01:35:21,230
- Behave properly with him.
- Okay.

1413
01:35:22,090 --> 01:35:23,660
Brother, I want to do something.

1414
01:35:23,730 --> 01:35:25,140
I want to be someone.

1415
01:35:25,230 --> 01:35:28,070
I want to be a police
officer and be like you.

1416
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:30,070
What?

1417
01:35:30,430 --> 01:35:31,430
Say that again.

1418
01:35:31,500 --> 01:35:34,310
I want to join the police
force and be successful like you.

1419
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:35,470
Do something.

1420
01:35:36,070 --> 01:35:38,640
Makki, one needs to be enthusiastic,
energetic..

1421
01:35:39,240 --> 01:35:42,160
"Dedicated and intelligent
to be a police officer.

1422
01:35:42,610 --> 01:35:44,020
I am filled with these qualities, sir.

1423
01:35:44,250 --> 01:35:45,590
Just give me a Chance.

1424
01:35:45,620 --> 01:35:46,990
Makkhan Prajapati Pandey"

1425
01:35:47,080 --> 01:35:49,320
won't give you a
reason to complain. - Okay.

1426
01:35:49,990 --> 01:35:51,520
Fine, then your training begins today.

1427
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:54,700
I will tell Tiwari to
teach you work discipline.

1428
01:35:54,760 --> 01:35:55,500
Yes, sir.

1429
01:35:55,630 --> 01:35:57,610
Salute comrade Makkhi.

1430
01:36:00,630 --> 01:36:02,170
- Get it, Tiwari.
- Yes, sir.

1431
01:36:02,270 --> 01:36:04,770
First, I will provide him
with DIG level information"

1432
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:06,340
and then send him to camp.

1433
01:36:06,440 --> 01:36:07,540
Well done, Tiwari.

1434
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:08,780
Makkhi.

1435
01:36:09,140 --> 01:36:10,520
He was right here. Where did he go?

1436
01:36:10,610 --> 01:36:12,140
Give me your full name.

1437
01:36:12,610 --> 01:36:14,350

1441
01:36:24,190 --> 01:36:26,190
Sir, please do something.

1442
01:36:26,790 --> 01:36:28,130
Do you suspect anyone?

1443
01:36:28,190 --> 01:36:32,140
Sir, I've a good
relation with everyone.

1444
01:36:32,330 --> 01:36:34,710
I don't know how all this happened.

1445
01:36:40,370 --> 01:36:41,640
Get up

1446
01:36:55,350 --> 01:36:56,590
Sir.

1447
01:36:56,650 --> 01:36:58,330
Makkhl's.-

1448
01:37:00,160 --> 01:37:01,500
How many people were present?

1449
01:37:06,360 --> 01:37:09,070
He's now Makkhanchand
Prajapati Pandey.

1450
01:37:09,530 --> 01:37:12,380
I like it.

1451
01:37:12,870 --> 01:37:14,080
Do you suspect anyone?

1452
01:37:15,770 --> 01:37:18,380
Makkhanchand Prajapati Pandey.
- Yes, sir.

1453
01:37:18,440 --> 01:37:20,820
- Any plans for tonight?
- Nothing, sir.

1454
01:37:20,940 --> 01:37:24,390
How about a bash with your
elder brother? - Okay, brother.

1455
01:37:32,790 --> 01:37:37,200
"When I stretch my body."

1456
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:44,440
"When I stretch my body."

1457
01:37:44,870 --> 01:37:48,650
"I can hear sighs
coming from the road."

1458
01:37:48,710 --> 01:37:52,710
"My gait" creates a uproar."

1459
01:37:52,810 --> 01:37:57,550
"Everyone looks charmed by me."

1460
01:37:58,720 --> 01:38:01,390
"My Photo,"

1461
01:38:02,720 --> 01:38:09,400
"Stick my photo..
to your heart with Fevicol."

1462
01:38:10,590 --> 01:38:17,240
"Stick my photo..
to your heart with Fevicol."

1463
01:38:17,300 --> 01:38:19,250
"With Fevicol."

1464
01:38:19,300 --> 01:38:20,650
"With Fevicol."

1465
01:38:20,740 --> 01:38:23,810
"I am ready.."

1466
01:38:24,740 --> 01:38:27,810
"I am ready and willing."

1467
01:38:27,910 --> 01:38:31,320
"Woo me with a miss call."

1468
01:38:32,620 --> 01:38:39,260
"Stick my photo..
to your heart with Fevicol."

1469
01:38:39,320 --> 01:38:42,770
"sway away."

1470
01:38:42,930 --> 01:38:46,270
"sway away."

1471
01:38:46,630 --> 01:38:48,540
“Keep swaying -"

1472
01:38:48,600 --> 01:38:50,440
"Sway with fun."

1473
01:38:50,630 --> 01:38:52,540
“Keep swaying -"

1474
01:38:52,600 --> 01:38:54,840
"Sway with the intoxication."

1475
01:38:58,610 --> 01:39:03,350
"Fall in love with
the daughter of grapes."

1476
01:39:04,650 --> 01:39:08,460
"Fall in love with
the daughter of grapes."

1477
01:39:08,620 --> 01:39:12,330
"You'll forget all advices
with just a quarter of it."

1478
01:39:12,620 --> 01:39:16,400
"The drinker will enjoy life."

1479
01:39:16,630 --> 01:39:20,630
"This alcohol gives
you a kick with just water."

1480
01:39:21,400 --> 01:39:25,470
"Come sweetheart,
let rne show you heaven."

1481
01:39:27,370 --> 01:39:31,650
"Let me set this cold water on fire."

1482
01:39:31,810 --> 01:39:35,550
"The entire country's."

1483
01:39:37,650 --> 01:39:42,890
"The entire country's your slave."

1484
01:39:43,720 --> 01:39:45,700
"I am a tandoori.."

1485
01:39:45,760 --> 01:39:48,830
"I am a tandoori chicken."

1486
01:39:48,890 --> 01:39:52,340
"Gobble me down with alcohol."

1487
01:39:53,660 --> 01:40:00,010
"Stick my photo..
to your heart with Fevicol."

1488
01:40:19,590 --> 01:40:24,270
"People say I am tasty like butter."

1489
01:40:25,700 --> 01:40:29,370
"People say I am tasty like butter."

1490
01:40:29,730 --> 01:40:31,440
"I'll cut your heart out."

1491
01:40:31,530 --> 01:40:33,450
"My youth's sharp like cutter."

1492
01:40:33,740 --> 01:40:37,410
"My grace makes anyone faint."

1493
01:40:37,740 --> 01:40:41,810
"Better keep the shutter
of your eyes closed."

1494
01:40:42,450 --> 01:40:46,390
"People of the city
are waiting for you."

1495
01:40:46,450 --> 01:40:47,830
"Waiting for you."

1496
01:40:47,880 --> 01:40:52,420
"Your waist rocks the
district of the state."

1497
01:40:52,890 --> 01:40:56,390
"But the story.."

1498
01:40:58,730 --> 01:41:03,470
"But this is old story."

1499
01:41:04,900 --> 01:41:06,570
"But still.."

1500
01:41:06,900 --> 01:41:13,450
"But still I will stick your
photo on my heart, with Fevicol."

1501
01:41:14,910 --> 01:41:17,950
"My gypsy with siren's ready."

1502
01:41:18,010 --> 01:41:21,090
"Ride it away with petrol."

1503
01:41:21,480 --> 01:41:23,430
"With petrol."

1504
01:41:23,490 --> 01:41:24,830
"With petrol."

1505
01:41:24,920 --> 01:41:30,030
"Stick my photo.. to your heart."

1506
01:41:32,100 --> 01:41:33,440
"Stick my photon"

1507
01:41:33,500 --> 01:41:36,840
"With Fevicol."

1508
01:41:37,470 --> 01:41:40,850
"I will flirt around with baby doll."

1509
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:44,950
"I will woo this
girl with a miss call."

1510
01:41:45,480 --> 01:41:47,350
"With a bat and ball."

1511
01:41:47,440 --> 01:41:48,850
"With the cinema hall."

1512
01:41:48,950 --> 01:41:51,450
"With marriage hall."

1513
01:41:51,510 --> 01:41:52,860
"With over all."

1514
01:41:52,950 --> 01:41:58,630
"I will stick your photo on my heart,
with Fevicol."

1515
01:41:58,890 --> 01:42:01,890
"Stick my photo.. to your heart."

1516
01:42:01,960 --> 01:42:03,900
"Stick it with.."

1517
01:42:04,060 --> 01:42:05,870
"Stick it with.."

1518
01:42:06,030 --> 01:42:09,500
"Stick it with Fevicol."

1519
01:42:09,570 --> 01:42:11,410
Oh no!

1520
01:42:21,010 --> 01:42:22,490
Handover the urn to him.

1521
01:42:23,280 --> 01:42:24,420
Please leave.

1522
01:42:27,520 --> 01:42:28,760
This poster's fine.

1523
01:42:29,750 --> 01:42:31,360
Just the emblem should come up here.

1524
01:42:32,090 --> 01:42:33,500
- Go.
- Yes.

1525
01:42:33,690 --> 01:42:36,000
The money's going to the party.

1526
01:42:39,530 --> 01:42:41,030
Send the money by evening.

1527
01:42:41,600 --> 01:42:42,770
Chunni.

1528
01:42:43,600 --> 01:42:45,050
You didn't go for the oblations.

1529
01:42:45,440 --> 01:42:46,610
Brother, the rally's tomorrow.

1530
01:42:47,270 --> 01:42:48,270
So I sent uncle along.

1531
01:42:48,370 --> 01:42:49,440
Uncle?

1532
01:42:49,640 --> 01:42:51,380
Genda was your brother.

1533
01:42:52,440 --> 01:42:53,610
Wasn't he your brother?

1534
01:42:54,710 --> 01:42:56,780
Did you do any duty as his brother?

1535
01:42:57,480 --> 01:42:59,790
You just performed the final rites,
lit his pyre.

1536
01:43:00,220 --> 01:43:01,520
Was that all your duty.

1537
01:43:02,650 --> 01:43:05,030
Brother, you raised
me with such love and care.

1538
01:43:06,120 --> 01:43:07,800
I never missed father.

1539
01:43:09,630 --> 01:43:11,500
But I miss him today.

1540
01:43:13,130 --> 01:43:16,130
If father had been alive
then Pandey would've been dead.

1541
01:43:37,820 --> 01:43:39,360
Baccha Singh, what's going on?

1542
01:43:40,090 --> 01:43:41,730
The high-commamfs coming
on a visit next week.

1543
01:43:42,160 --> 01:43:43,330
And we aren't prepared.

1544
01:43:43,690 --> 01:43:45,370
You didn't attend
yesterday's meeting either.

1545
01:43:45,430 --> 01:43:47,840
If you can't handle the responsibility
then vacate your post.

1546
01:43:48,060 --> 01:43:48,840
Resign.

1547
01:43:49,070 --> 01:43:50,510
Your responsibility will
be given to someone else.

1548
01:43:51,330 --> 01:43:52,540
Resign!

1549
01:43:53,670 --> 01:43:55,270
That will take time.

1550
01:43:56,210 --> 01:43:57,840
Written on paper.

1551
01:43:58,440 --> 01:43:59,750
I'll have to think of a reason.

1552
01:44:03,210 --> 01:44:04,590
Will this do?

1553
01:44:05,620 --> 01:44:06,860
Get lost!

1554
01:44:11,790 --> 01:44:13,700
Rajjo. Have your lunch properly.

1555
01:44:13,720 --> 01:44:15,700
I'll be late.
We'll have dinner together.

1556
01:44:15,730 --> 01:44:19,470
Listen. Please take me to the temple.

1557
01:44:19,530 --> 01:44:20,370
I want to pray.

1558
01:44:20,430 --> 01:44:21,700
Makkhi will take you to the temple.

1559
01:44:21,770 --> 01:44:23,440
I didn't marry Makkhi.

1560
01:44:23,630 --> 01:44:25,540
Always Makkhi.

1561
01:44:26,540 --> 01:44:27,540
If you couldn't spare
time for your wife"

1562
01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:28,810
"then why did you marry me?

1563
01:44:28,870 --> 01:44:30,440
You're getting angry for no reason.

1564
01:44:31,540 --> 01:44:33,610
Come on, I'll take you along.

1565
01:44:33,710 --> 01:44:35,280
Forget it, I will go with Makkhi.

1566
01:44:35,380 --> 01:44:36,450
I see.

1567
01:44:39,750 --> 01:44:41,820
Siddiqui, I will come post lunch.

1568
01:44:42,220 --> 01:44:45,330
Your sister-in-law's
cleaning my clock.

1569
01:44:45,720 --> 01:44:46,290
Okay-

1570
01:44:46,760 --> 01:44:47,930
See you.

1571
01:44:49,930 --> 01:44:51,100
Come on.

1572
01:44:51,160 --> 01:44:52,330
Come on.

1573
01:44:53,100 --> 01:44:54,400
Listen.

1574
01:44:55,400 --> 01:44:58,070
- You're my husband.
- Great.

1575
01:44:58,400 --> 01:45:00,250
- Not my slave.
- Wow

1576
01:45:00,770 --> 01:45:03,010
That was a thrilling performance.

1577
01:45:03,410 --> 01:45:06,180
If my stubbornness hampers your work..

1578
01:45:06,240 --> 01:45:07,750
"Then you should scold me.

1579
01:45:08,410 --> 01:45:10,190
Come on.

1580
01:45:11,080 --> 01:45:12,250
Give it.

1581
01:45:16,090 --> 01:45:17,290
I'm really busy.

1582
01:45:23,960 --> 01:45:25,440
Answer my prayer soon.

1583
01:45:27,200 --> 01:45:28,440
Let's go.

1584
01:45:29,200 --> 01:45:30,180
So what did you pray for?

1585
01:45:30,270 --> 01:45:33,940
- I said make me an uncle soon.
- I see.

1586
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:35,280
And what did God say?

1587
01:45:35,310 --> 01:45:37,220
He said it will take
as long as it normally takes.

1588
01:45:37,270 --> 01:45:38,280
I see.

1589
01:45:38,340 --> 01:45:41,120
So you're discussing
about junior Chulbul.

1590
01:45:46,150 --> 01:45:47,290
Brother Makkhi.

1591
01:45:47,320 --> 01:45:48,730
What are you doing?
- Leave me. Leave me.

1592
01:45:48,950 --> 01:45:51,460
Expecting a heir after
killing one of mine.

1593
01:45:51,720 --> 01:45:55,000
Don't touch her.
I said don't touch her.

1594
01:45:55,130 --> 01:46:00,730
Pandeji your wife has given birth
to a very beautiful baby.

1595
01:46:01,470 --> 01:46:03,470
Congratulations!

1596
01:46:04,470 --> 01:46:05,470
No!

1597
01:46:14,340 --> 01:46:16,150
Sister-i n-law!

1598
01:46:17,980 --> 01:46:19,320
Bacchal

1599
01:46:24,190 --> 01:46:26,430
This is called settling the scores.

1600
01:46:27,490 --> 01:46:30,230
Brother as principal
sum and child for interest.

1601
01:46:55,920 --> 01:46:57,900
We couldn't save your child.

1602
01:47:00,360 --> 01:47:01,300
Sorry

1603
01:47:50,010 --> 01:47:51,850
Surprising, Mr. Pandey.

1604
01:48:26,380 --> 01:48:29,190
That rascal killed my son.

1605
01:48:33,120 --> 01:48:35,460
I'm very upset, Mr. Pandey.

1606
01:48:38,190 --> 01:48:40,960
Teach Baccha Singh a lesson"

1607
01:48:42,990 --> 01:48:51,470
so he realises
what I've lost and who.

1608
01:48:56,210 --> 01:48:58,380
I promise you.

1609
01:48:59,580 --> 01:49:03,580
After today Baccha Singh and family..

1610
01:49:04,310 --> 01:49:06,260
Will never have a heir.

1611
01:49:21,600 --> 01:49:23,170
- Hello.
- Baccha sir.

1612
01:49:24,070 --> 01:49:25,410
Chulbul's coming.

1613
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:27,110
What to do?

1614
01:49:32,910 --> 01:49:34,550
Today you'll realise"

1615
01:49:35,250 --> 01:49:39,590
why I shouldn't have
been transferred to Kanpur.

1616
01:49:51,190 --> 01:49:54,200
Baccha sir, I suggest that let's
not get into this mess right now.

1617
01:49:54,600 --> 01:49:56,700
That Pandey's very dangerous.

1618
01:49:56,930 --> 01:49:59,970
We'll take some time and
deal with him properly some day?

1619
01:50:00,040 --> 01:50:03,040
Does it look I can wait
any longer to kill Pandey?

1620
01:50:04,040 --> 01:50:05,420
It will happen today.

1621
01:50:05,940 --> 01:50:07,480
It has to happen today.

1622
01:50:07,540 --> 01:50:08,990
You are right.

1623
01:50:09,050 --> 01:50:10,390
It has to happen today.

1624
01:50:10,450 --> 01:50:12,150
My conscience's saying the same thing.

1625
01:50:12,550 --> 01:50:14,460
Pandey will die today"

1626
01:50:14,550 --> 01:50:16,500
and we'll also perform
his oblations at this very bank.

1627
01:50:17,220 --> 01:50:19,500
We'll shred him to pieces.

1628
01:50:19,560 --> 01:50:22,300
We'll make mincemeat out of him.

1629
01:50:22,390 --> 01:50:26,070
Just sit down comfortably
and watch Pandey's death.

1630
01:50:26,130 --> 01:50:29,170
Today we'll make
his plight such that.

1631
01:50:29,230 --> 01:50:31,680
He will regret being born.

1632
01:50:32,670 --> 01:50:38,020
And why did I lock horns with Baccha.

1633
01:52:23,510 --> 01:52:24,460
Pandey!

1634
01:52:34,090 --> 01:52:37,130
Mr. Pandey. Did that hurt?

1635
01:53:41,490 --> 01:53:43,770
Prepare for his final rites.

1636
01:53:44,860 --> 01:53:46,640
I'll go say thanks to God.

1637
01:54:23,630 --> 01:54:28,480
Such a pious person
should meet God personally.

1638
01:55:04,840 --> 01:55:08,250
See. I told you that
Pandey's very dangerous.

1639
01:55:08,340 --> 01:55:09,690
But you didn't..

1640
01:55:45,620 --> 01:55:47,390
Pandey!

1641
01:56:22,790 --> 01:56:28,430
Hit only as much as you can endure.

1642
01:56:31,790 --> 01:56:36,800
Didn't you hear what
I was telling your brother?

1643
01:57:11,430 --> 01:57:13,240
Don't relieve him, Pandey.

1644
01:57:13,670 --> 01:57:15,670
If he stays alive he'll stay in news.

1645
01:57:15,710 --> 01:57:17,580
The law will stay in news.

1646
01:57:18,110 --> 01:57:20,780
You see, the pressure
should be maintained.

1647
01:57:20,840 --> 01:57:21,850
Come on.

1648
01:57:22,080 --> 01:57:24,790
Handcuff me.

1649
01:57:25,350 --> 01:57:27,120
- Arrest me.
- Handcuff him.

1650
01:57:27,180 --> 01:57:29,860
- Let's go quickly.
- Let's go.

1651
01:57:30,290 --> 01:57:31,700
Let's show him our hospitality.

1652
01:57:32,590 --> 01:57:33,860
Pandey.

1653
01:57:34,590 --> 01:57:36,370
This is just temporary.

1654
01:57:36,730 --> 01:57:38,210
I will come back.

1655
01:57:38,600 --> 01:57:41,800
And then I will snatch
everything from you one by one.

1656
01:57:42,370 --> 01:57:45,370
I will show you the
dreadful face of death.

1657
01:57:45,600 --> 01:57:47,100
That's Baccha's promise.

1658
01:57:47,470 --> 01:57:48,880
That reminds me.

1659
01:57:50,410 --> 01:57:53,580
You've made my wife suffer.

1660
01:58:02,590 --> 01:58:05,570
Pandey. You've made a mess.

1661
01:58:06,290 --> 01:58:08,670
You should've have warned
me before relieving rne.

1662
01:58:09,160 --> 01:58:10,660
Didn't you hear what he was saying?

1663
01:58:11,160 --> 01:58:12,200
How long will I have to deal with him?

1664
01:58:12,300 --> 01:58:13,540
Don't I have other things to do?

1665
01:58:13,630 --> 01:58:16,470
I'll lock horns with
someone else if I have to.

1666
01:58:16,500 --> 01:58:18,340
He'll love it and so will I.

1667
01:58:19,300 --> 01:58:20,710
- Siddiqi, thank you.
- Thank you sir.

1668
01:58:22,170 --> 01:58:23,740
Who filled you with holes?

1669
01:58:24,140 --> 01:58:25,180
It wasn't me.

1670
01:58:25,380 --> 01:58:26,820
Baccha Singh did this to him, sir.

1671
01:58:27,140 --> 01:58:28,420
- Jai Hind.
- You're here.

1672
01:58:29,410 --> 01:58:31,410
He's useful. Take him to the hospital.

1673
01:58:32,150 --> 01:58:34,690
Ask him where Baccha
had hidden his treasure.

1674
01:58:34,750 --> 01:58:37,700
And if he doesn't tell
then fill him with more holes.

1675
01:58:38,760 --> 01:58:40,260
So, Mr. Mathur.

1676
01:58:40,420 --> 01:58:42,370
Can Kanpur breathe
a sigh of relief now?

1677
01:58:43,230 --> 01:58:44,830
You rid us of this sinner.

1678
01:58:45,060 --> 01:58:47,670
I want a holiday.
I want to take your wife out.

1679
01:58:47,830 --> 01:58:49,170
I will make you uncle.

1680
01:58:49,200 --> 01:58:51,740
So, Tiwari. How long does it take?

1681
01:58:52,240 --> 01:58:55,180
It will take as long
as it normally does.

1682
01:58:55,270 --> 01:58:57,080
Chaubey, in my case.

1683
01:58:57,340 --> 01:59:00,120
In this case all cases are same, sir.

1684
01:59:01,380 --> 01:59:05,520
In this case all cases are same, sir!

1685
01:59:05,580 --> 01:59:08,460
Surprising, Chaubey.

1686
01:59:13,860 --> 01:59:15,860
Little rascal. Open your eyes.

1687
01:59:16,360 --> 01:59:17,700
I am your papa-

1688
01:59:18,860 --> 01:59:22,370
And I am your papa's PaPa-

1689
01:59:22,730 --> 01:59:24,270
Your grandpa.

1690
01:59:25,200 --> 01:59:28,880
Hey. He looks just
like his grandfather.

1691
01:59:29,210 --> 01:59:30,380
What?

1692
01:59:30,610 --> 01:59:32,210
Rajjo's fat h er.

1693
01:59:35,550 --> 01:59:37,220
Surprising, sir.

1694
01:59:37,550 --> 01:59:39,250
You scared me.

1695
01:59:40,450 --> 01:59:42,730
He didn't like the compliment either.

1696
01:59:44,150 --> 01:59:45,130
Brother.

1697
01:59:45,220 --> 01:59:47,570
- Photo.
- You!

1698
01:59:47,890 --> 01:59:49,730
Smile.

1699
01:59:49,790 --> 01:59:50,790
Why smile?

1700
01:59:50,890 --> 01:59:52,270
Here's laughter.

1701
02:00:02,910 --> 02:00:04,750
Mother, how's the shirt...

1702
02:00:06,910 --> 02:00:07,910
Rajjo!

1703
02:00:08,180 --> 02:00:10,320
What's your father
doing next to my mother?

1704
02:00:11,610 --> 02:00:12,920
Mr. Pandey!

1705
02:00:17,190 --> 02:00:18,690
Excuse me.

1706
02:00:26,600 --> 02:00:28,200
Prajapati Pandey.

1707
02:00:28,260 --> 02:00:30,710
Allah! My prince charming.

1708
02:00:30,770 --> 02:00:32,710
Drinking tea all alone.

1709
02:00:32,770 --> 02:00:34,270
My heart aches.

1710
02:00:34,870 --> 02:00:38,940
Mix me in your life
and I'll be your tea.

1711
02:00:39,840 --> 02:00:43,480
Look Aasma. I've a family.

1712
02:00:44,210 --> 02:00:45,780
I've son, daughters-in-law.

1713
02:00:46,320 --> 02:00:47,730
And now even have a grandson.

1714
02:00:48,520 --> 02:00:49,860
This won't do.

1715
02:00:50,290 --> 02:00:52,790
Allah! My wretched husband's coming.

1716
02:00:53,190 --> 02:00:56,570
Aasma, who are you talking to?

1717
02:00:56,630 --> 02:00:59,730
You will never change.
Give me the phone.

1718
02:01:01,630 --> 02:01:02,910
Papa.

1719
02:01:03,500 --> 02:01:04,710
Drinking tea all alone.

1720
02:01:04,800 --> 02:01:05,910
Give him tea.

1721
02:01:06,400 --> 02:01:07,640
Papa.

1722
02:01:07,800 --> 02:01:09,840
Last night I dreamt about mother.
- Mother?

1723
02:01:09,910 --> 02:01:10,850
Yes.

1724
02:01:11,640 --> 02:01:14,880
She was asking... who is Aasma?

1725
02:01:15,310 --> 02:01:16,550
Aasma.

1726
02:01:16,650 --> 02:01:19,220
And she asked me to say this verbatim.

1727
02:01:19,720 --> 02:01:22,700
That, if you do like her then..

1728
02:01:22,750 --> 02:01:24,320
You can give her
a place in your heart.

1729
02:01:24,390 --> 02:01:26,230
You'll have a support for old age.

1730
02:01:26,490 --> 02:01:27,490
Son.

1731
02:01:27,520 --> 02:01:29,260
Your mother“ - What?

1732
02:01:29,390 --> 02:01:30,930
Had a big heart.

1733
02:01:32,760 --> 02:01:34,330
Thank you.

1734
02:01:34,900 --> 02:01:37,340
Sir, we heard that Chhedi
Singh's brother is looking for you.

1735
02:01:37,430 --> 02:01:38,500
Chhedi Singh's brother?

1736
02:01:38,530 --> 02:01:39,240
Yes, sir.

1737
02:01:39,370 --> 02:01:40,850
Why does he want to dig his own grave?

1738
02:01:40,870 --> 02:01:42,350
Have this ice-candy?

1739
02:01:42,510 --> 02:01:43,920
I will go put a bullet in him.

1740
02:01:44,670 --> 02:01:48,620
"I always do as I please."

1741
02:01:51,610 --> 02:01:55,390
"Never listen to anyone."

1742
02:01:58,720 --> 02:02:02,030
"I always do as I please."

1743
02:02:02,360 --> 02:02:05,740
"Never listen to anyone."

1744
02:02:05,800 --> 02:02:09,540
I never do regular duty."

1745
02:02:09,700 --> 02:02:11,470
"Sitting in the police station."

1746
02:02:13,040 --> 02:02:15,610
"Sitting in the police
station on duty."

1747
02:02:15,710 --> 02:02:19,050
"Pandeyji's whistling freely."

1748
02:02:19,910 --> 02:02:22,550
"Sitting in the police
station on duty."

1749
02:02:22,580 --> 02:02:25,750
"Pandeyji's whistling freely."

1750
02:02:32,960 --> 02:02:38,000
"This police officer has
squeezed all the fun out of Munni."

1751
02:02:38,060 --> 02:02:43,410
"You'll be left with nothing
if the bird flies away."

1752
02:02:43,470 --> 02:02:46,780
"If the bird flies away."

1753
02:02:46,840 --> 02:02:49,750
"If the bird flies away."

1754
02:02:50,570 --> 02:02:51,750
"I admit.."

1755
02:02:51,770 --> 02:02:55,780
"I admit your beauty's enthralling."

1756
02:02:55,850 --> 02:03:01,760
"But PandeyjFs on duty.“

1757
02:03:04,620 --> 02:03:07,860
"He calls me his life."

1758
02:03:08,020 --> 02:03:11,440
"He calls me his sweetheart."

1759
02:03:11,590 --> 02:03:15,340
"Always up to some tricks."

1760
02:03:15,430 --> 02:03:18,780
"He calls me his princess."

1761
02:03:18,940 --> 02:03:23,880
"I never get trapped."

1762
02:03:25,880 --> 02:03:29,380
"I never get trapped."

1763
02:03:29,450 --> 02:03:32,950
"You can demand anything you like."

1764
02:03:33,120 --> 02:03:35,460
"Sitting in the police station."

1765
02:03:58,040 --> 02:04:01,420
"When Mr. Pandey arrives."

1766
02:04:01,640 --> 02:04:04,750
"That's when the beat plays right."

1767
02:04:04,910 --> 02:04:08,520
"Goons and ruffians shiver
in their boots and say."

1768
02:04:08,680 --> 02:04:11,670
"We'd rather die."

1769
02:04:12,020 --> 02:04:16,990
"I never do anything
that doesn't suit me."

1770
02:04:19,400 --> 02:04:22,540
"I never do anything
that doesn't suit me."

1771
02:04:22,600 --> 02:04:26,510
"I attack my enemy unalarmed."

1772
02:04:26,570 --> 02:04:28,670
"Sitting in the police station."

1773
02:04:30,040 --> 02:04:32,520
"Sitting in the police
station on duty."

1774
02:04:32,580 --> 02:04:35,520
"Pandeyji's whistling freely."

1775
02:04:35,580 --> 02:04:37,850
"It's a bad habit-"

1776
02:04:37,880 --> 02:04:40,760
"Pandeyji's whistling“"

1777
02:04:40,850 --> 02:04:44,460
"Pandeyji's whistling freely."

1778
02:04:44,520 --> 02:04:47,800
"Pandeyji's whistling freely on duty."
