1
00:02:28,167 --> 00:02:29,542
So... You think you are too big?

2
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:33,125
Too proud?

3
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:36,333
Very powerful?

4
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:40,792
It's an illusion...

5
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,542
Now watch!

6
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:47,750
How I break your arrogance!

7
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:54,167
You ruined my whole life!

8
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:58,208
I will slice through you!

9
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:03,083
Now watch the show!

10
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,792
Your game is over.

11
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,417
Now watch the show!

12
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,792
Hey, Dashrath!

13
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:10,333
Have you lost your mind?

14
00:03:10,417 --> 00:03:13,167
Why have you started this fire?

15
00:03:13,667 --> 00:03:16,292
You will die in this fire.

16
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:18,375
Your body won't even be found.

17
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:21,292
Have you lost your mind?

18
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,000
Now watch the show!

19
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,458
Now watch the show!

20
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:09,917
Dashrath...

21
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:13,500
You sold off the last goat
to buy a hammer and chisel?

22
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,125
I'm asking you.

23
00:04:15,542 --> 00:04:17,583
Son of a pig... I'm your father!

24
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:19,750
Where are you going?

25
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,125
Shukla ji, this is the most backward
region of Independent India.

26
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:27,958
Nothing has
changed here for centuries.

27
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:31,625
It's been 13 years since independence
but there's not a whiff of it here.

28
00:04:32,167 --> 00:04:35,042
No school, no hospital,
no road either here.

29
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:38,000
Do you see this mountain?

30
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:41,833
It has enslaved Gehlore village.

31
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:45,292
The nearest town, Wazirgunj,
is just four miles across the mountain.

32
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:49,500
But one has to go 40 miles around
the mountain to get there.

33
00:04:49,917 --> 00:04:52,833
So many have died
trying to cross this mountain.

34
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:55,375
What is this?

35
00:04:56,351 --> 00:04:58,083
So you want to wear shoes
and feel like a lord?

36
00:04:58,167 --> 00:05:00,542
I made a mistake, Sir.
It won't happen again.

37
00:05:01,292 --> 00:05:02,667
How can we believe you?

38
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,750
I swear on my mother.

39
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:08,708
Make him wear shoes, the kind
where he'll never need another pair again.

40
00:05:08,792 --> 00:05:11,250
-Forgive me, Sir.
-Nail a horseshoe onto him.

41
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:12,375
Get lost.

42
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:14,000
Forgive me Sir.

43
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:26,250
How are you, Mukhiya ji?

44
00:05:26,542 --> 00:05:28,042
We are honored, sir.

45
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:30,042
How are you?

46
00:05:30,792 --> 00:05:31,833
What is going on here?

47
00:05:31,917 --> 00:05:33,708
Just some minor repairs.

48
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:36,000
Your first visit here
since winning the election!

49
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:37,667
What can I say, Mukhiya ji?

50
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:42,208
Politics! It just sucks you in.

51
00:05:42,292 --> 00:05:45,292
You literally have to hold on
to the damn chair.

52
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:48,875
But then you get to eat
the cream too don't you?

53
00:05:49,917 --> 00:05:51,833
Just win the election once...

54
00:05:52,417 --> 00:05:55,083
Your house turns
into the Taj Mahal!

55
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:58,625
Shukla ji, get a ticket for
my son, Ruab, in the next election.

56
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:00,333
Yes, yes, oh, meet him.

57
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:01,667
Who is he?

58
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:04,167
Alok, a very good journalist!

59
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:07,958
He's asking me to get a road
made from Gehlore to Wazirgunj.

60
00:06:08,542 --> 00:06:09,792
Now think.

61
00:06:10,417 --> 00:06:14,542
If the project is so big,
think how big the planning will be!

62
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:17,375
You are having a lot of fun!

63
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:19,750
Take a picture.

64
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:20,958
Come, son.

65
00:06:32,917 --> 00:06:34,708
Name, Dashrath Manjhi.

66
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:36,458
Village, Gehlore.

67
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,292
District, Gaya.
State, Bihar.

68
00:06:40,167 --> 00:06:41,625
The first time I saw him...

69
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:44,875
I knew he was crazy.

70
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,708
Hey, Dashrath.
Lower your head!

71
00:06:47,792 --> 00:06:49,167
Can't you see who is sitting here?

72
00:06:49,417 --> 00:06:50,875
What are you doing, Ruab?

73
00:06:52,292 --> 00:06:54,167
At least don't hit him in my presence!

74
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,042
I am a Legislator and he is my voter.

75
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,708
I was doing it out of respect for you.

76
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:59,708
Forget the respect.

77
00:06:59,792 --> 00:07:01,708
You don't know the reality.

78
00:07:02,667 --> 00:07:05,500
Yesterday that fool set the
whole mountain on fire.

79
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:08,708
He's eaten so many rats
that they've got into his brain.

80
00:07:08,917 --> 00:07:11,958
We know how to handle
these villains. Leave them to us.

81
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,667
For your sake.

82
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:05,042
Dashrath, what are you doing?

83
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:07,083
Breaking the mountain.

84
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:09,917
What! You'll break the mountain?

85
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:11,083
Yes.

86
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:13,583
-Alone?
-Yes.

87
00:09:14,042 --> 00:09:15,542
Have you gone mad?

88
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:16,667
Yes.

89
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,750
You will die.
The devil has got into him!

90
00:10:06,667 --> 00:10:10,958
Dashrath was born in a very poor
farm laborerâ€™s house.

91
00:10:11,917 --> 00:10:15,167
The lowest of the low caste,
"Moosahar" or "The rat eaters".

92
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:18,750
As per tradition,
he was married off as a child.

93
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:22,417
30 bottles of liquor and five pigs,
that was the deal.

94
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,417
Get up, Dashrath.

95
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:29,292
Making a fool of me are you?

96
00:10:31,917 --> 00:10:34,667
The name of his child bride was Phaguniya.

97
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,125
What happened?

98
00:10:43,167 --> 00:10:46,042
Sir, you called
me and I came running.

99
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:50,000
When will you repay the money
you owe Mukhiya ji?

100
00:10:50,417 --> 00:10:52,125
I don't have anything, sir.

101
00:10:52,417 --> 00:10:55,792
You can check.
Not a single penny. See...

102
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:57,667
You have money to get drunk.

103
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,083
What are you saying, sir?

104
00:11:00,167 --> 00:11:01,583
If I don't drink, how do I live?

105
00:11:01,667 --> 00:11:03,167
And if I don't live, how will I repay you?

106
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,458
Idiot, talking nonsense.

107
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,583
My lord, the child will hurt his hands.

108
00:11:09,667 --> 00:11:11,542
I'll hit myself.

109
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:16,375
You wretched Magru, you worm,
son of a pig...

110
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:18,708
Take this! And this.

111
00:11:18,792 --> 00:11:20,167
Get kicked...

112
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:22,000
Get kicked and die.

113
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:23,667
Hey, drama queen!

114
00:11:26,542 --> 00:11:28,958
Are you going to pay up
or you want to be shod?

115
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:31,500
I'll pay up. I'll pay up.

116
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:32,708
Stay away.

117
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:35,625
But how?

118
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:38,292
My life is already bonded to you.

119
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:41,625
Well then get your
son's bonded now!

120
00:11:42,917 --> 00:11:44,625
Take him, take him.

121
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:46,458
Now he will pay your debt.

122
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,083
Mother, I won't go.
Mukhiya beats me.

123
00:11:52,167 --> 00:11:53,208
Really?

124
00:11:53,292 --> 00:11:57,333
Shut up, you bum!
You have fun and I get kicked?

125
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,083
You are now bonded to the Mukhiya.

126
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:00,333
I won't go.

127
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,333
Won't go?

128
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:04,208
And who will repay the debt?
Your father?

129
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:05,417
I won't go.

130
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:07,750
You bastard!
You won't go?

131
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:08,875
Come on.

132
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:12,875
Run, Dashrath, run.

133
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:15,375
Catch that son of a swine.

134
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:47,125
Going to break the mountain again?

135
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:50,542
It's been two years now,
has anyone come to help you?

136
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,667
Don't you understand?
Or has your brain turned to stone?

137
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:57,208
One day you'll die
breaking those rocks.

138
00:12:57,292 --> 00:12:59,167
Once there was a monkey king
who lifted a mountain

139
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,917
and now we have Dashrath here
who'll break one! Mad man! Mad man!

140
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,167
Here, I'm back.

141
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:22,958
Is everything fine?

142
00:13:23,792 --> 00:13:24,875
Good.

143
00:13:26,667 --> 00:13:29,792
You thought I wouldn't return?

144
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:31,875
Wrong!

145
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:36,042
I will not rest till I break you.

146
00:13:38,542 --> 00:13:40,958
We are in for a very long battle,
you and I.

147
00:13:45,292 --> 00:13:47,458
So are you ready?

148
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,250
He's ready!

149
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:13,792
Being smart with me?

150
00:14:14,542 --> 00:14:17,542
I'll not leave you,
I'll never forgive you.

151
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:32,375
See what you have turned me into.

152
00:14:33,417 --> 00:14:36,750
I can't forget anything.
That's the damn problem.

153
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:38,917
Like a film, it's got into my head.

154
00:14:39,292 --> 00:14:41,833
It starts playing from any point.

155
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:44,667
Backwards, forwards
forwards, backwards...

156
00:14:45,792 --> 00:14:47,833
Damn thing keeps dancing around
in my head.

157
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:54,875
I remember everything.

158
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:58,333
Everything.

159
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:02,125
As if it was yesterday.

160
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,667
Yesterday.

161
00:15:20,917 --> 00:15:25,083
Toys, magical toys,
to stop the kids crying.

162
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:29,958
Toys, soft toys to keep your wife smiling.

163
00:15:30,167 --> 00:15:32,125
Toys, toys.

164
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:37,375
Elephants, horses, Palanquin...
How great is my lord...

165
00:15:52,917 --> 00:15:54,417
Toys, toys--

166
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:58,750
You blind scoundrel!
Wait till I cool you down...

167
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:09,125
Great! Fantastic! Alive!

168
00:16:31,292 --> 00:16:33,042
First wash your face.

169
00:16:37,292 --> 00:16:39,833
Hello, brothers!

170
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,250
The back of
untouchability is broken.

171
00:16:45,417 --> 00:16:49,708
All are Equal...
Equal... Equal...

172
00:16:49,792 --> 00:16:51,167
What are they celebrating?

173
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:53,042
End of untouchability!

174
00:16:53,167 --> 00:16:55,000
The Government has passed a law.

175
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:56,125
All are equal.

176
00:16:56,292 --> 00:16:58,208
What? We can touch anybody?

177
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:00,208
See! It's printed in the newspaper.

178
00:17:01,042 --> 00:17:02,375
END OF UNTOUCHABILITY

179
00:17:02,667 --> 00:17:04,000
Oh, my god.

180
00:17:06,167 --> 00:17:07,750
We can touch anybody!

181
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:10,125
All are Equal...
Equal... Equal...

182
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,708
Untouchability is gone with the wind!

183
00:17:12,792 --> 00:17:16,500
All are Equal...
Equal... Equal...

184
00:17:18,542 --> 00:17:21,542
Dreaming of entering the temples...

185
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:26,083
The sons of bitches won't pipe down
until 10, 20 of them are hacked.

186
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:46,792
All are Equal...
Equal... Equal...

187
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:51,917
All are Equal...
Equal... Equal...

188
00:17:52,667 --> 00:17:56,958
All are Equal...
Equal... Equal...

189
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,750
Want to come up?

190
00:19:21,292 --> 00:19:23,000
You an outsider?

191
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,000
No, I'm very much from here...

192
00:19:27,042 --> 00:19:29,125
ran away as a child to Dhanbad.

193
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:31,625
Worked in the coal mines.

194
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:34,333
Coal mines...

195
00:19:34,917 --> 00:19:37,000
They call it "Black Diamond".

196
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:40,917
It's hard work...

197
00:19:41,917 --> 00:19:44,750
if you do it well, you get money!
Hard cash.

198
00:19:45,542 --> 00:19:47,917
And if you work hard, you get respect too.

199
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:52,542
But I am free spirited.

200
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:56,125
I just felt like it...
so I'm coming back home.

201
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:57,958
Which village?

202
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,583
Gehlore.

203
00:20:00,167 --> 00:20:01,333
-Gehlore?
-Yes.

204
00:20:01,417 --> 00:20:03,542
You'll cross the whole mountain?

205
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:05,583
-Sure!
-My God.

206
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,042
What name did you say?

207
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:12,875
What name did you say?

208
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:14,667
When did I say anything, uncle?

209
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:16,583
Now I am saying it.

210
00:20:18,292 --> 00:20:19,875
Dashrath is my name.

211
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:05,500
After seven years when he returned,
the village had not changed a bit...

212
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:10,542
as if it had been forgotten by time.

213
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,625
Your shoe, keep it on my head.

214
00:21:32,042 --> 00:21:34,167
-What are you saying, Mukhiya ji?
-Keep it... Keep it...

215
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:36,458
Please don't make me sin, sir.

216
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:39,583
It is not your fault.

217
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:41,958
What happened?

218
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:44,292
The government has abolished
the caste system.

219
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:46,792
Next they will abolish the landlords.

220
00:21:47,542 --> 00:21:49,375
The country will burn.

221
00:21:49,792 --> 00:21:51,167
Has everyone gone mad?

222
00:21:51,792 --> 00:21:55,250
Don't worry.
So what if a law is made?

223
00:21:55,417 --> 00:21:56,542
Who will implement it?

224
00:21:57,375 --> 00:21:59,208
Damn fools.

225
00:21:59,417 --> 00:22:02,917
Good morning, Mukhiya ji.
How are you?

226
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,667
You have not changed a bit.

227
00:22:09,417 --> 00:22:10,625
Still the same glow...

228
00:22:11,792 --> 00:22:12,792
And you!

229
00:22:13,292 --> 00:22:14,792
You have changed completely.

230
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:19,167
Handsome, healthy,
manly smile on your face.

231
00:22:20,667 --> 00:22:21,583
Son...

232
00:22:22,167 --> 00:22:23,708
forgive me.

233
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:27,500
I don't recognize you.

234
00:22:27,583 --> 00:22:30,708
How could you recognize me?
It's been seven years.

235
00:22:31,542 --> 00:22:32,667
How?

236
00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:34,333
I'm Dashrath.

237
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:37,125
Magru Manjhi's son.

238
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:41,333
You trash!

239
00:22:41,792 --> 00:22:42,917
Get away! You scum!

240
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,958
I heard, the government made
everyone equal, we can touch anybody.

241
00:22:46,083 --> 00:22:47,250
You son of worm,

242
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:49,250
can a frog become a horse
by wearing a horse shoe?

243
00:22:49,375 --> 00:22:51,708
The government loosens its grip...
So will you piss on my head?

244
00:22:52,875 --> 00:22:55,875
Give him such a thrashing that
he never, ever...

245
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,708
forgets his caste!

246
00:22:58,958 --> 00:23:01,625
Eyes down. Eyes down!

247
00:23:01,708 --> 00:23:03,208
Hey, the government has said--

248
00:23:03,292 --> 00:23:04,333
What government?

249
00:23:04,417 --> 00:23:05,917
The government says
we can touch anybody.

250
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,083
What did it say?

251
00:23:07,167 --> 00:23:08,542
That all are equal.

252
00:23:08,708 --> 00:23:10,042
You scum.

253
00:23:10,375 --> 00:23:12,000
Hey, the government has said--

254
00:23:12,417 --> 00:23:14,542
They ruined everything.

255
00:23:16,792 --> 00:23:18,792
Hey! Who is this?

256
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,875
Dashrath!

257
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I'm Jhumru.

258
00:23:26,083 --> 00:23:28,667
How are you, brother?

259
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:31,500
Great. Fantastic. Alive!

260
00:23:31,708 --> 00:23:33,667
What happened to you?

261
00:23:33,792 --> 00:23:36,333
Got a great welcome
from the villagers! See...

262
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:38,917
So did you get hitched or not?

263
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:41,000
Bhura, come here.

264
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,917
Hey, uncle!

265
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:47,208
How are you, Father? Long live!

266
00:23:50,083 --> 00:23:52,542
Where did you go?
Those fuckers ruined everything.

267
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:57,750
My fate is bad...

268
00:23:58,292 --> 00:24:01,500
-Your mother died and left me...
-I heard...

269
00:24:01,583 --> 00:24:04,333
...the cursed one.
Now how will I live?

270
00:24:09,375 --> 00:24:10,917
Hey, Uncle!

271
00:24:11,125 --> 00:24:13,250
I won't live, I will die.

272
00:24:13,333 --> 00:24:15,208
Why are you worried?

273
00:24:15,976 --> 00:24:17,392
Now that he is back
we'll get his bride.

274
00:24:17,517 --> 00:24:19,458
She'll feed you hot food.

275
00:24:19,917 --> 00:24:22,333
In a week you'll be fine.

276
00:24:23,458 --> 00:24:24,625
Hey, Lauki.

277
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,542
She is mine.

278
00:24:27,625 --> 00:24:28,667
-Which one?
-This one.

279
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:31,000
And this is mine, the slow train.

280
00:24:31,083 --> 00:24:32,333
Get lost!

281
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:35,583
Oh, my goodness, who is this?

282
00:24:35,667 --> 00:24:37,875
We thought some English man
had come,

283
00:24:37,958 --> 00:24:39,875
but this is a local rowdy.

284
00:24:40,833 --> 00:24:42,875
You are looking absolutely bombastic.

285
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,333
Come, wash up.

286
00:24:45,833 --> 00:24:47,917
Did you find a girlfriend?

287
00:24:48,083 --> 00:24:50,083
Torn his clothes while having fun!

288
00:24:51,125 --> 00:24:52,500
Yes, I met up with your sister!

289
00:24:55,333 --> 00:24:56,375
Smartass!

290
00:24:56,458 --> 00:24:57,750
Here, eat some food.

291
00:24:58,042 --> 00:25:00,500
Eat first, then have your fun.

292
00:25:05,583 --> 00:25:06,583
Uncle...

293
00:25:06,833 --> 00:25:11,750
Hey, what is life without a wife?

294
00:25:11,833 --> 00:25:15,000
Eating and sleeping
Eating and sleeping

295
00:25:15,083 --> 00:25:18,167
Eating and sleeping
Eating and sleeping

296
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:20,708
Eating and sleeping
Eating and sleeping

297
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:30,167
We have come to take
Dashrath's wife.

298
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:31,583
He ran away.

299
00:25:31,667 --> 00:25:33,792
What's the guarantee,
he won't run away again?

300
00:25:33,875 --> 00:25:34,917
Let it be.

301
00:25:35,125 --> 00:25:36,542
I've seen a better boy in the city.

302
00:25:36,875 --> 00:25:40,625
He has a government job in Gaya,
a watchman in the municipality.

303
00:25:40,792 --> 00:25:41,917
What does this wastrel do?

304
00:25:42,042 --> 00:25:43,833
You bloody pig thief,

305
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:46,625
You steal pigs from villages and sell
them to the butcher in the city

306
00:25:46,708 --> 00:25:48,417
and you dare to call my son a wastrel!

307
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:52,458
You drunkard! Don't make me lose
my head or I'll thrash you.

308
00:25:52,542 --> 00:25:54,458
-What's the problem?
-Hold your tongue

309
00:25:54,542 --> 00:25:57,583
or I'll pull it out, you cheat.

310
00:25:57,667 --> 00:25:59,250
They gave 100 rupees for her.

311
00:25:59,333 --> 00:26:02,333
If you have any guts,
pay up 200 and take her.

312
00:26:02,458 --> 00:26:04,958
-Forget it, Baba, I don't want her.
-No. No.

313
00:26:05,042 --> 00:26:08,792
What does he think of himself?
I spit on him!

314
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:11,375
God knows who you got
me married to as a child.

315
00:26:12,875 --> 00:26:14,125
Let's go.

316
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:18,375
You keep your princess at home.

317
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,917
That's your wife, Phaguniya.

318
00:26:27,625 --> 00:26:28,958
This is Phaguniya?

319
00:26:30,333 --> 00:26:31,500
This is my wife?

320
00:26:32,792 --> 00:26:34,250
How is it possible?

321
00:26:34,792 --> 00:26:37,375
She is mine.
You dare marry her to anybody else.

322
00:26:39,333 --> 00:26:40,625
Just now you said you don't want her.

323
00:26:40,708 --> 00:26:42,667
When did I say that?
Where did I say that?

324
00:26:43,208 --> 00:26:44,708
Must have said it as a child.

325
00:26:46,042 --> 00:26:49,125
Hey, Phaguniya.
You understand, don't you?

326
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,125
You come with me.

327
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:54,042
Kalua, Bilua, come here quick.

328
00:26:54,333 --> 00:26:59,750
Get lost or your corpses
will leave this house.

329
00:27:01,875 --> 00:27:05,042
You watch!

330
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:07,125
I will carry her away.

331
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:11,042
You dare marry her to anyone else!

332
00:27:50,208 --> 00:27:52,333
A fair is not meant to be
enjoyed with one's father!

333
00:27:52,625 --> 00:27:55,208
Come with me, we'll have some fun.

334
00:27:55,542 --> 00:27:57,875
I thought you were going to
take me away.

335
00:28:00,292 --> 00:28:01,542
Working on it.

336
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,542
I'll throw money on your
father's face and take you away.

337
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:07,500
Phaguniya? Phaguniya.

338
00:28:07,583 --> 00:28:09,333
What is it, Mother?

339
00:28:09,417 --> 00:28:10,500
See this.

340
00:29:02,042 --> 00:29:03,792
-How much for this?
-Ten rupees.

341
00:29:06,542 --> 00:29:07,958
I only have five rupees.

342
00:29:08,667 --> 00:29:10,625
-Leave it.
-Wait.

343
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:13,917
The second one we will buy next year!

344
00:29:50,417 --> 00:29:52,042
I got a gift for you.

345
00:29:55,875 --> 00:29:57,292
This is the Taj Mahal.

346
00:29:57,417 --> 00:30:00,125
An Emperor built it in memory of his wife.

347
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,542
So small?

348
00:30:03,375 --> 00:30:04,500
This is a toy.

349
00:30:04,583 --> 00:30:06,542
The real one is as big as our mountain.

350
00:30:09,292 --> 00:30:12,167
I can't bear it any more.

351
00:30:14,417 --> 00:30:17,042
Tell me one thing, are we not married?

352
00:30:17,792 --> 00:30:19,333
Are you not my wife?

353
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:22,042
Then why does your father not
send you with me?

354
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:25,125
Baba says you don't earn.
How will you support me?

355
00:30:25,417 --> 00:30:28,333
You don't worry, I'll go across
the mountain to Wazirgunj.

356
00:30:28,417 --> 00:30:33,208
I'll beg, borrow, steal,
I'll sell myself, but I'll keep you happy.

357
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:38,250
-I know, but--
-No ifs and buts...

358
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:44,583
I can't live without you.
You come now.

359
00:30:45,292 --> 00:30:47,583
Or I will eat you alive.

360
00:30:49,208 --> 00:30:50,583
What are you doing?

361
00:30:53,917 --> 00:30:55,417
Someone will see.

362
00:30:56,125 --> 00:30:58,958
Let them see, I'm on fire.

363
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:01,333
Tell me the truth.
What is in your heart?

364
00:31:01,625 --> 00:31:03,250
Show me.

365
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,583
Phaguniya.

366
00:31:05,792 --> 00:31:07,042
Phaguniya.

367
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,667
Where are you?

368
00:31:09,208 --> 00:31:10,958
Is there an animal in the bushes?

369
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:12,458
Yes, Mother.

370
00:31:13,042 --> 00:31:14,167
When do I see you again?

371
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
What for?
To play with toys?

372
00:31:19,667 --> 00:31:22,000
If you want me, speak to my father.

373
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,292
Or if you have the guts
then elope with me.

374
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:31,500
Oh, how she drives me crazy!

375
00:31:32,417 --> 00:31:35,583
Hey, Bhura, what are you doing?

376
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:40,125
It has been two years.
You still don't have any brats.

377
00:31:40,208 --> 00:31:44,000
We'll see when your wife comes
how many brats you produce!

378
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:46,792
You'll go straight into the pit.

379
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:54,500
Water, Jhumru, bring some water.

380
00:31:54,583 --> 00:31:55,792
Bring some water.

381
00:31:55,875 --> 00:31:59,208
Hey, idiot, you want to put out the fire?

382
00:31:59,875 --> 00:32:01,958
If the bricks get wet,
I'll throw everyone in.

383
00:32:02,167 --> 00:32:03,083
Get back, away.

384
00:32:03,167 --> 00:32:04,958
He is dying, sir!

385
00:32:05,125 --> 00:32:06,833
He will die.

386
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:10,333
So? Let him die if he
doesn't know how to work.

387
00:32:12,333 --> 00:32:13,958
What will you do? Eat him?

388
00:32:14,125 --> 00:32:16,542
You'll have to give compensation.

389
00:32:16,625 --> 00:32:17,792
Get back.

390
00:32:17,917 --> 00:32:20,875
What will she eat?
How will she live?

391
00:32:21,667 --> 00:32:24,917
This asshole wants to be a leader!

392
00:32:25,292 --> 00:32:28,625
The chicken is trying to be a tiger.
You want compensation?

393
00:32:29,875 --> 00:32:31,042
Get back.

394
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,208
Damn it!

395
00:32:43,875 --> 00:32:45,542
What kind of life is this?

396
00:32:47,042 --> 00:32:51,458
Bhura's life is made.
At least he is out of this hell.

397
00:32:55,542 --> 00:32:57,125
What game is this?

398
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,208
How much more will you torture us?

399
00:33:02,792 --> 00:33:04,625
What's the use of killing the dead!

400
00:33:05,292 --> 00:33:08,333
If you have the guts,
then stop the powerful!

401
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:10,500
Want to be called God?

402
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:15,250
Is this your world?
If you give life, why this torture?

403
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:18,250
Is there any kindness or not?

404
00:33:18,333 --> 00:33:20,875
You make mistakes
and we get punished!

405
00:33:20,958 --> 00:33:23,583
Why? Why?

406
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:26,875
Hey! Look at that!
See, that's Bhura, our Bhura.

407
00:33:27,208 --> 00:33:29,125
He died and became a star.

408
00:33:29,875 --> 00:33:31,708
His whole life, he was bonded...

409
00:33:32,208 --> 00:33:34,625
He's shining after his death...
The bastard.

410
00:33:36,333 --> 00:33:37,625
He is shining.

411
00:33:51,333 --> 00:33:52,583
Dashrath...

412
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,958
are you a man or a mouse?

413
00:33:55,833 --> 00:33:57,208
Mouse, no man.

414
00:33:58,292 --> 00:34:01,375
Your father in law is marrying
off your wife to a city man.

415
00:34:01,833 --> 00:34:03,458
Then you can keep shaking it.

416
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:05,917
-What did you say?
-Then you can keep shaking it.

417
00:34:16,542 --> 00:34:20,167
Scoundrel! You'll marry my wife
to someone else?

418
00:34:25,625 --> 00:34:26,833
Let's see.

419
00:34:29,333 --> 00:34:31,583
Hey, Kalua! Bilua! Catch him.

420
00:34:31,958 --> 00:34:33,542
Move away,
I want to speak to Phaguniya.

421
00:34:33,625 --> 00:34:35,083
Phaguniya, what do you say?

422
00:34:36,833 --> 00:34:38,625
Go. Go inside.

423
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,792
Don't you dare!

424
00:34:41,667 --> 00:34:43,958
You think I'll give you my daughter?

425
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:46,833
Don't know where your next
meal is coming from.

426
00:34:46,917 --> 00:34:49,208
-How you will take care of her?
-With Love.

427
00:34:49,458 --> 00:34:51,292
Love will fill her stomach?

428
00:34:52,042 --> 00:34:53,083
Phaguniya.

429
00:34:53,333 --> 00:34:54,708
Open the door, Phaguniya.

430
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:57,125
Get lost, you loser.

431
00:35:00,292 --> 00:35:01,583
Hey, you villagers.

432
00:35:02,208 --> 00:35:04,958
He is marrying off my wife
to someone else.

433
00:35:05,042 --> 00:35:06,292
Tell me, is it fair?

434
00:35:07,083 --> 00:35:10,833
This greedy old man
is selling his own daughter.

435
00:35:10,917 --> 00:35:12,250
Tell me, is it fair?

436
00:35:12,625 --> 00:35:16,208
He'll ruin her life.
Tell me, is it fair?

437
00:35:19,458 --> 00:35:20,542
Tell me, Phaguniya...

438
00:35:21,458 --> 00:35:23,625
will you come with me
or rot here for the rest of your life?

439
00:35:24,042 --> 00:35:25,208
Tell me.

440
00:35:25,958 --> 00:35:27,667
What are you thinking?
Get up.

441
00:35:37,167 --> 00:35:39,833
You dare come closer,
I'll hack you to bits.

442
00:35:40,208 --> 00:35:42,542
Move!

443
00:35:45,583 --> 00:35:48,250
I'll cut you.

444
00:35:48,667 --> 00:35:52,458
Stop him!

445
00:36:21,125 --> 00:36:24,042
The rat has bitten off our nose.

446
00:36:25,458 --> 00:36:26,625
Let's go.

447
00:37:08,208 --> 00:37:11,208
Oh, my beloved!

448
00:37:12,458 --> 00:37:15,542
I want to tell you

449
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:20,083
I'm covered in your color

450
00:37:21,333 --> 00:37:24,125
I'm wearing your color

451
00:37:25,542 --> 00:37:29,542
My body is adorned

452
00:37:31,667 --> 00:37:35,583
With your arms

453
00:37:38,417 --> 00:37:42,125
Oh my beloved!

454
00:37:42,958 --> 00:37:46,833
Oh my beloved!

455
00:37:47,458 --> 00:37:50,583
Oh my beloved!

456
00:37:50,667 --> 00:37:53,500
Oh my beloved!

457
00:38:17,125 --> 00:38:18,875
You laugh after making me cry?

458
00:38:21,042 --> 00:38:24,125
Now laugh!

459
00:38:24,958 --> 00:38:27,250
Laugh!

460
00:38:27,333 --> 00:38:29,208
Laugh!

461
00:38:29,458 --> 00:38:31,250
Laugh!

462
00:38:32,917 --> 00:38:37,583
As I break you from top to bottom.

463
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:39,208
Laugh!

464
00:39:10,375 --> 00:39:12,708
There's a limit to everything.

465
00:39:13,542 --> 00:39:15,958
How long can we bear your madness?

466
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:17,750
Till the mountain is broken.

467
00:39:19,208 --> 00:39:23,458
What have you achieved in five years?
Have you even scratched the mountain?

468
00:39:24,208 --> 00:39:26,750
What the British couldn't
do in a 100 years,

469
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,875
the government couldn't do in 20 years.
You think you can do it alone?

470
00:39:31,542 --> 00:39:34,458
Stop it, old man, I'm tired.

471
00:39:35,958 --> 00:39:39,708
You aren't bothered about us,
at least take care of yourself,

472
00:39:39,958 --> 00:39:42,208
I can't bear to see you like this.

473
00:39:42,875 --> 00:39:45,042
You feel sad looking at me?

474
00:39:46,583 --> 00:39:47,875
Fine.

475
00:39:49,625 --> 00:39:51,208
You won't see me anymore.

476
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:08,083
Phaguniya, Phaguniya
Calls out your beloved

477
00:40:09,667 --> 00:40:15,583
Phaguniya Phaguniya
Calls out your beloved

478
00:40:16,917 --> 00:40:21,000
You live in my heart

479
00:40:23,042 --> 00:40:26,125
You are my world

480
00:40:26,833 --> 00:40:30,250
Phaguniya, Phaguniya

481
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:33,958
Phaguniya, Phaguniya

482
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:39,792
Phaguniya, Phaguniya

483
00:40:39,875 --> 00:40:45,250
Phaguniya, Phaguniya

484
00:41:07,083 --> 00:41:08,875
How much for this toy?

485
00:41:10,583 --> 00:41:12,042
I'm not a toy.

486
00:41:13,083 --> 00:41:14,667
But I want to play with this.

487
00:41:14,917 --> 00:41:16,208
Let go of my hand.

488
00:41:16,625 --> 00:41:18,917
Leave it or I'll cut off your
you know what!

489
00:41:19,208 --> 00:41:20,917
Then you can play with it forever.

490
00:41:22,625 --> 00:41:24,458
Come on, you'll have fun.

491
00:41:24,542 --> 00:41:25,917
Leave my hand alone!

492
00:41:27,542 --> 00:41:29,417
Come on, stop resisting.

493
00:41:33,167 --> 00:41:34,667
Dashrath.

494
00:41:36,875 --> 00:41:38,833
Dashrath, leave him.

495
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,500
Don't you trust me?

496
00:42:19,292 --> 00:42:24,292
Phaguniya.
O', Phaguniya! You are my life. Life.

497
00:42:26,458 --> 00:42:30,875
I love you so much,
so much, so much.

498
00:42:30,958 --> 00:42:34,792
How much do I love you?
Should I tear open my heart to show you?

499
00:42:34,917 --> 00:42:36,083
Get away.

500
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:38,625
Look...

501
00:42:39,458 --> 00:42:40,625
for you.

502
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,208
A soft, soft pillow.

503
00:42:46,792 --> 00:42:50,458
If we sleep with our heads together
on it-- It will be so much fun!

504
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:54,208
Why get a pillow?
Get a stone to break my head instead.

505
00:42:54,333 --> 00:42:57,000
When you are angry,
you get wild.

506
00:43:01,583 --> 00:43:03,250
Don't touch me.

507
00:43:04,083 --> 00:43:05,958
Why? I am your husband.

508
00:43:06,583 --> 00:43:07,833
If I don't touch you, who will?

509
00:43:09,625 --> 00:43:12,958
You think I am some lemon tree?
Squeeze it whenever you wish?

510
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:17,250
Okay. I made a mistake.
I lost my head.

511
00:43:17,333 --> 00:43:19,875
If anyone touches you,
can I just sit and watch?

512
00:43:19,958 --> 00:43:21,667
How many will you beat up, Dashrath?

513
00:43:22,083 --> 00:43:24,458
Mukhiya, the land lord,
the merchant, priest? Who all...

514
00:43:24,583 --> 00:43:25,917
Everyone has an evil eye.

515
00:43:26,125 --> 00:43:28,708
Whoever looks at you with
an evil eye I'll pull his eyes out.

516
00:43:29,208 --> 00:43:30,250
-Oh?
-Yes.

517
00:43:31,417 --> 00:43:33,167
-You are so powerful?
-Yes.

518
00:43:34,292 --> 00:43:36,208
-Big wrestler, eh?
-Sure.

519
00:43:36,583 --> 00:43:37,708
-Really?
-Yes.

520
00:43:37,958 --> 00:43:39,542
Let me check your strength.

521
00:43:39,625 --> 00:43:42,667
Hey! Hey! What are you doing?

522
00:43:44,458 --> 00:43:47,375
Hit him!
He deserves it.

523
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:51,208
-The pig brought a pillow.
-I was stupid to elope with him.

524
00:43:51,708 --> 00:43:53,667
You will stay an animal!

525
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,833
I won't stay another minute with you,
I am going.

526
00:44:01,292 --> 00:44:03,292
-Where?
-To hell.

527
00:44:03,375 --> 00:44:04,583
I'll come with you.

528
00:44:05,167 --> 00:44:06,583
We'll play pillow games.

529
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:09,625
Where are you going in the dark?
Some wolf will eat you.

530
00:44:09,792 --> 00:44:10,917
At least I'll be rid of you.

531
00:44:11,417 --> 00:44:12,500
A scorpion will bite you.

532
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,500
I don't want to talk to you.

533
00:44:16,208 --> 00:44:18,375
Listen, Phaguniya.

534
00:44:19,375 --> 00:44:20,542
Forgive me.

535
00:44:22,333 --> 00:44:24,000
Stop or I will jump off from here.

536
00:44:25,125 --> 00:44:26,917
Is that why you eloped with me?

537
00:44:28,083 --> 00:44:30,500
If anything happens to you,
what will I do?

538
00:44:32,208 --> 00:44:35,250
He has brains in his heels
and wants to become a father.

539
00:44:37,875 --> 00:44:39,292
Oh, what a miracle!

540
00:44:39,667 --> 00:44:41,250
Show me, show me.

541
00:44:44,417 --> 00:44:46,458
Hey, this is your father speaking.

542
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:48,542
What?

543
00:44:48,792 --> 00:44:50,000
He says, "Nine months."

544
00:44:51,083 --> 00:44:52,958
That's too long, come out soon.

545
00:44:54,083 --> 00:44:55,750
What? "Boom"?

546
00:44:56,250 --> 00:44:58,625
What? "Boom. Boom"?

547
00:45:00,292 --> 00:45:01,875
"Boompati, boom, boom!"

548
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:12,708
O', Phaguniya!

549
00:45:14,333 --> 00:45:15,667
Where is Dashrath?

550
00:45:16,208 --> 00:45:17,292
Come out.

551
00:45:18,292 --> 00:45:22,292
Where is the rat hiding?
Find him! Get everyone out!

552
00:45:22,625 --> 00:45:25,542
I'll burn down the whole settlement!
Come out.

553
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:27,375
You dare raise your hand to me?

554
00:45:27,458 --> 00:45:29,500
-What is it?
-Get him.

555
00:45:30,625 --> 00:45:31,625
Check there.

556
00:45:31,708 --> 00:45:33,000
The rat scuttled away.

557
00:45:33,667 --> 00:45:35,458
Only this bag of bones is here.

558
00:45:36,042 --> 00:45:39,625
You've bred a snake!
Where is Dashrath?

559
00:45:39,708 --> 00:45:41,500
I swear I don't know.

560
00:45:41,583 --> 00:45:42,833
-You don't know?
-No.

561
00:45:43,250 --> 00:45:44,375
Fool!

562
00:45:45,458 --> 00:45:47,625
Leave him.

563
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,458
Why are you looking for Dashrath?
A broken nose wasn't enough?

564
00:45:51,792 --> 00:45:53,042
Want your leg broken too?

565
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:56,167
You damn swine.

566
00:45:56,250 --> 00:45:58,250
Hey, Jhumru, stop.

567
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:01,833
Go inside.

568
00:46:01,917 --> 00:46:05,458
Hey, Lauki,
now, here is a delicious one!

569
00:46:05,542 --> 00:46:08,208
Everything is public property.
Get her.

570
00:46:14,875 --> 00:46:18,250
Leave me... Leave me...

571
00:48:30,542 --> 00:48:32,833
After few years ,
when I went back to Gehlore,

572
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,375
I heard he was still breaking
the mountain.

573
00:48:36,583 --> 00:48:37,833
I was amazed...

574
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:42,042
and felt like meeting this crazy man.

575
00:48:42,167 --> 00:48:43,708
Are you Dashrath Manjhi?

576
00:48:44,958 --> 00:48:46,125
How are you?

577
00:48:46,833 --> 00:48:49,542
Great! Fantastic! Alive!

578
00:48:50,625 --> 00:48:51,917
I'm a journalist.

579
00:48:52,458 --> 00:48:53,708
Name is Alok Jha,

580
00:48:54,667 --> 00:48:56,542
I write for the Bharat Samachar newspaper.

581
00:48:56,667 --> 00:48:58,667
Heard you've been breaking
this mountain for years.

582
00:48:58,958 --> 00:49:00,125
Why?

583
00:49:00,708 --> 00:49:02,250
Digging my own grave.

584
00:49:02,958 --> 00:49:04,167
You are joking?

585
00:49:04,667 --> 00:49:06,792
What should I say?
That I'm making a Taj Mahal?

586
00:49:06,958 --> 00:49:08,375
You are offended.

587
00:49:08,875 --> 00:49:12,125
Everyone says that I'm a mad man.
Wasting my life.

588
00:49:13,083 --> 00:49:14,958
You don't waste your time.

589
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,500
It is an internal wound.

590
00:49:19,625 --> 00:49:21,708
Till I break this mountain...

591
00:49:23,667 --> 00:49:25,000
it won't heal.

592
00:49:26,333 --> 00:49:28,542
You have taken on a big task.

593
00:49:29,458 --> 00:49:30,583
Okay.

594
00:49:30,708 --> 00:49:34,458
Let me know when you are finished,
I'll print your photo in the newspaper.

595
00:49:34,792 --> 00:49:36,542
Trying to be a well-wisher?

596
00:49:38,375 --> 00:49:41,000
Then come.
Lend me a hand.

597
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:14,375
Hold her. Hurry.

598
00:50:16,042 --> 00:50:17,417
The baby is coming out!

599
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:18,625
Hold her in the water.

600
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,333
Careful, careful.

601
00:50:20,417 --> 00:50:22,458
Call her husband! Hurry!

602
00:50:26,333 --> 00:50:27,500
What happened?

603
00:50:28,167 --> 00:50:31,000
Don't shout! Hold her.

604
00:50:36,958 --> 00:50:40,708
Breath heavily, once more.

605
00:50:42,542 --> 00:50:44,333
Once more.

606
00:51:02,667 --> 00:51:03,750
What are you doing?

607
00:51:03,833 --> 00:51:06,208
Dear Goddess, one request...

608
00:51:07,417 --> 00:51:09,000
give me one daughter just like you.

609
00:51:09,917 --> 00:51:11,750
Then you can take my life.

610
00:51:12,083 --> 00:51:13,208
Get lost.

611
00:51:16,417 --> 00:51:17,917
Melodramatic!

612
00:51:23,458 --> 00:51:26,708
It has been a long time,
I really want to.

613
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:29,542
Let's play pillow games.

614
00:51:31,292 --> 00:51:33,917
Your games lead to my bloated belly.

615
00:51:35,292 --> 00:51:37,583
Nothing to eat and
he wants to breed a battalion!

616
00:51:42,333 --> 00:51:44,542
Don't worry,
I got work across the mountain.

617
00:51:45,042 --> 00:51:49,208
Once the daughter is born,
we will go to the city and earn a lot.

618
00:51:49,542 --> 00:51:52,125
We'll make our son an officer
and daughter a teacher!

619
00:51:52,208 --> 00:51:54,000
Life will sparkle.

620
00:51:54,667 --> 00:51:55,875
Come on.

621
00:51:57,958 --> 00:51:59,458
Now, when we go to the city.

622
00:52:48,917 --> 00:52:49,917
My baby...

623
00:52:50,958 --> 00:52:52,875
I will take you to the city.

624
00:52:53,125 --> 00:52:57,625
So you'll never need to climb a mountain.
You wonâ€™t need to stay in the dark.

625
00:52:59,125 --> 00:53:02,500
We'll eat good food.

626
00:53:02,667 --> 00:53:04,667
Drink sweet water.

627
00:53:05,167 --> 00:53:07,083
And have a lot of fun, my baby.

628
00:53:38,083 --> 00:53:39,333
Dashrath!

629
00:53:40,625 --> 00:53:43,000
Your wife has fallen
from the mountain!

630
00:54:03,625 --> 00:54:05,208
What happened, Phaguniya?

631
00:54:06,917 --> 00:54:10,958
The mountain was too high,
I couldn't climb it...

632
00:54:11,917 --> 00:54:13,125
I slipped.

633
00:54:17,042 --> 00:54:18,500
Doctor...

634
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:38,958
Hold on, don't give up.
Soon we'll reach the hospital.

635
00:55:05,792 --> 00:55:09,833
Move! Move!
Where is the doctor?

636
00:55:35,250 --> 00:55:36,542
We couldn't save her...

637
00:55:37,875 --> 00:55:39,292
but your daughter is saved.

638
00:56:06,417 --> 00:56:07,750
You think you are too big?

639
00:56:09,750 --> 00:56:11,000
Too powerful?

640
00:56:13,042 --> 00:56:14,500
Very proud?

641
00:56:17,958 --> 00:56:19,167
It's an illusion.

642
00:56:23,375 --> 00:56:26,958
Watch! How I break your arrogance!

643
00:56:30,333 --> 00:56:33,083
You ruined my whole life!

644
00:56:34,417 --> 00:56:36,708
I will break you.

645
00:56:38,958 --> 00:56:42,083
You watch the show now!

646
00:56:43,208 --> 00:56:45,042
Your game is over!

647
00:57:06,458 --> 00:57:10,833
Must admit, he is true to his word.

648
00:57:10,917 --> 00:57:13,792
He's cut the climb by at least an hour.

649
00:57:14,292 --> 00:57:17,167
So, Dashrath, how much longer?

650
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,208
Till I break it.

651
00:57:19,292 --> 00:57:21,667
The brave one!
Keep it up, kid!

652
00:57:21,750 --> 00:57:24,958
When you finish the road,
We'll name it after you.

653
00:57:25,042 --> 00:57:26,167
Rajkumariya...

654
00:57:27,292 --> 00:57:29,542
how many times have I told you
not to climb the mountain?

655
00:57:30,042 --> 00:57:34,042
You may break your leg, get hurt,
what will I tell your mother then?

656
00:57:34,917 --> 00:57:38,458
Mother has gone to God's house.
You eat quietly.

657
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,458
Stop this tomfoolery!
Enough!

658
00:57:45,792 --> 00:57:48,625
Driving me crazy!

659
00:57:49,083 --> 00:57:53,417
Can't you see?
Do I take care of myself or your kids?

660
00:57:53,625 --> 00:57:56,125
Listen, get married again.

661
00:57:56,208 --> 00:57:58,583
Or find some work
and look after your kids.

662
00:57:58,750 --> 00:58:00,958
Don't ever talk
about a second marriage.

663
00:58:01,042 --> 00:58:02,667
What will I tell Phaguniya?

664
00:58:02,750 --> 00:58:04,542
Moron! She is dead.

665
00:58:04,625 --> 00:58:05,917
Not to me.

666
00:58:07,042 --> 00:58:09,292
And regarding work, this is my work now.

667
00:58:09,792 --> 00:58:12,292
What will you feed your kids?
These rocks?

668
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:16,625
Here! Nurse the buggers
and feed them rocks!

669
00:58:16,708 --> 00:58:18,167
I can't handle your kids!

670
00:58:18,375 --> 00:58:20,792
I will take care of my kids!
I will!

671
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,208
-Do it then! I'm off!
-You don't need to go crazy.

672
00:58:24,875 --> 00:58:29,042
Come, Bhagirath.
See, I am nursing them! Happily!

673
00:58:34,250 --> 00:58:35,917
Stop. Stop.

674
00:58:36,583 --> 00:58:38,083
you fucking mountain cutter.

675
00:58:38,667 --> 00:58:40,417
Why are you blocking
my path like a rock?

676
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:42,417
-Move aside.
-I can make you a profit.

677
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:44,208
-Profit?
-Yes.

678
00:58:44,292 --> 00:58:46,417
Takes you four days to lug goods
from the market?

679
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:48,917
-Yes.
-In a bumpy bullock cart ride?

680
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,125
-Yes.
-And additional expenses?

681
00:58:51,208 --> 00:58:52,208
Yes, so?

682
00:58:52,292 --> 00:58:53,667
I'll get them across in a day.

683
00:58:53,917 --> 00:58:55,917
Really? How?

684
00:58:56,167 --> 00:58:57,792
The mountain is my friend.

685
00:58:58,917 --> 00:59:03,667
The earth is his seat

686
00:59:04,792 --> 00:59:09,750
And sky, the tent

687
00:59:14,083 --> 00:59:18,000
He is covered with dust

688
00:59:18,875 --> 00:59:23,458
And still remains pure

689
00:59:27,708 --> 00:59:31,625
He is covered with dust

690
00:59:31,958 --> 00:59:35,250
And still remains pure

691
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:44,292
Little more.

692
00:59:46,292 --> 00:59:49,375
Baba.
Why does everyone call you mad?

693
00:59:49,458 --> 00:59:51,458
Those who do can't see.

694
00:59:51,667 --> 00:59:52,667
What, Baba?

695
00:59:52,833 --> 00:59:54,542
Magic. Want to see?

696
00:59:54,625 --> 00:59:56,667
-Yes!
-Then close your eyes.

697
00:59:58,458 --> 01:00:02,458
Abracadabra. Show magic to my kids,

698
01:00:02,542 --> 01:00:04,083
show them a path
through that mountain!

699
01:00:04,167 --> 01:00:05,625
-See it?
-Yes!

700
01:00:05,708 --> 01:00:07,792
See the bullock cart racing?

701
01:00:07,875 --> 01:00:09,625
-Yes!
-What else do you see?

702
01:00:10,042 --> 01:00:12,833
-Cycle.
-Motor car! Bike!

703
01:00:23,125 --> 01:00:26,417
God is great! God is great!

704
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:29,917
God is great! God is great!

705
01:00:32,042 --> 01:00:36,458
God is great! God is great!

706
01:00:48,250 --> 01:00:50,500
Baba, what was Mother like?

707
01:00:53,208 --> 01:00:54,542
Exactly like you.

708
01:00:54,958 --> 01:00:56,500
When will Mother come back?

709
01:00:57,958 --> 01:01:00,958
When the road is ready,
Mother will be back too.

710
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:12,417
How are you, brother?

711
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,250
Great! Fantastic! Alive!

712
01:01:17,708 --> 01:01:19,583
-Tell me one thing.
-Yes.

713
01:01:19,667 --> 01:01:21,667
There are so many jobs in the world,

714
01:01:22,125 --> 01:01:24,833
you couldn't find anything better than
breaking the mountain?

715
01:01:24,958 --> 01:01:26,750
Everyone has their own skills.

716
01:01:27,583 --> 01:01:31,333
You read and write,
I break the mountain.

717
01:01:32,750 --> 01:01:34,542
How do you get so much strength?

718
01:01:35,792 --> 01:01:37,000
It's love.

719
01:01:38,917 --> 01:01:40,375
First, for my wife.

720
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,500
Now, for this mountain.

721
01:01:45,750 --> 01:01:48,208
Such a deep thought
and you put it so simply.

722
01:01:49,083 --> 01:01:52,625
Look at me,
I wanted to be an honest journalist...

723
01:01:54,083 --> 01:01:55,917
but became a pimp of the politicians...

724
01:01:57,833 --> 01:01:59,250
I hate myself.

725
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:02,167
Why not start
your own newspaper?

726
01:02:04,333 --> 01:02:06,375
You think it's easy?

727
01:02:09,083 --> 01:02:11,083
Is it more difficult than
breaking a mountain?

728
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,250
Long live the saint in the sack!

729
01:03:31,333 --> 01:03:34,375
Let the earth split,
the sky fall, the floods come.

730
01:03:34,458 --> 01:03:36,792
But the saint in the sack,
remains unaffected!

731
01:03:36,875 --> 01:03:38,542
Great is the saint in the sack.

732
01:03:38,833 --> 01:03:41,458
Let me fall at your feet!

733
01:03:41,583 --> 01:03:42,958
What are you doing, Baba?

734
01:03:43,042 --> 01:03:44,958
You fool.

735
01:03:45,208 --> 01:03:47,000
There is a drought, you bastard!

736
01:03:47,083 --> 01:03:48,875
All the villagers are leaving.

737
01:03:48,958 --> 01:03:51,833
There is no water
and you are still digging!

738
01:03:51,958 --> 01:03:54,542
Come to the city.
You won't survive here!

739
01:03:54,833 --> 01:03:56,292
I can't leave the mountain.

740
01:03:57,458 --> 01:03:59,833
-What?
-I can't leave the mountain.

741
01:04:00,042 --> 01:04:02,167
Are you completely crazy?

742
01:04:02,250 --> 01:04:04,375
Trying to be a hero?

743
01:04:04,458 --> 01:04:06,235
In this scorching heat,
you want to break a mountain?

744
01:04:06,335 --> 01:04:09,625
What will you eat? What'll you drink?
Fool! You'll burn to death!

745
01:04:09,708 --> 01:04:10,875
So you go!

746
01:04:12,958 --> 01:04:14,000
Go.

747
01:04:14,375 --> 01:04:17,500
Here's some money.

748
01:04:20,375 --> 01:04:21,583
Don't give them any grief.

749
01:04:22,625 --> 01:04:24,917
I will stay here
and break the mountain.

750
01:04:25,417 --> 01:04:27,292
Then break it you, idiot! I'm off!

751
01:04:28,167 --> 01:04:31,208
I don't know what treasure
you'll find here.

752
01:04:31,292 --> 01:04:32,583
A path.

753
01:04:35,542 --> 01:04:36,750
I will find the path.

754
01:04:37,208 --> 01:04:40,583
Come on, kids! Let this fool die.

755
01:07:46,208 --> 01:07:49,208
Tinkle, tinkle...

756
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:56,125
Tinkle, tinkle...

757
01:07:58,083 --> 01:08:01,000
Tinkle, tinkle...

758
01:08:04,583 --> 01:08:06,417
Tinkle...

759
01:08:13,083 --> 01:08:14,792
I only had one dream.

760
01:08:18,917 --> 01:08:21,167
To buy the second anklet
for your other foot.

761
01:08:23,333 --> 01:08:26,458
Don't have food to eat and
I'm dreaming of ornaments!

762
01:08:33,875 --> 01:08:37,042
I've spent my whole life
with the tinkling of your anklet.

763
01:08:38,375 --> 01:08:40,542
Tinkle, tinkle...

764
01:11:27,375 --> 01:11:29,250
You saved my life!

765
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,083
Now you've become a true friend.

766
01:11:43,750 --> 01:11:46,042
Come, let me give you some love.

767
01:11:47,375 --> 01:11:50,375
Phaguniya...

768
01:12:05,583 --> 01:12:07,667
You fair maiden of Gehlore

769
01:12:09,292 --> 01:12:11,583
Will you come with me?

770
01:12:13,042 --> 01:12:15,208
You fair maiden of Gehlore

771
01:12:17,167 --> 01:12:19,500
Will you come with me?

772
01:12:20,667 --> 01:12:25,208
For you I made this path

773
01:12:25,833 --> 01:12:28,333
Which goes to Wazirganj

774
01:12:29,583 --> 01:12:33,250
Phaguniya...

775
01:12:33,458 --> 01:12:35,917
Phaguniya...

776
01:12:37,542 --> 01:12:42,500
Phaguniya...

777
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:48,417
Phaguniya...

778
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,917
Oh, my God, wonder of wonders.

779
01:17:42,083 --> 01:17:43,167
The power of passion.

780
01:17:43,458 --> 01:17:44,875
Cutting through hard rock.

781
01:17:50,458 --> 01:17:52,208
Great, my son.

782
01:17:53,458 --> 01:17:56,250
You have shown the world.
We were blind.

783
01:17:56,875 --> 01:17:59,042
Couldn't see the road
hidden in the mountain.

784
01:18:00,583 --> 01:18:02,500
Baba! For you.

785
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:04,833
Saved it for your hammer
and chisel.

786
01:18:05,125 --> 01:18:07,875
Thank you, my child.

787
01:18:07,958 --> 01:18:09,750
-Long live!
-Long live!

788
01:18:25,875 --> 01:18:27,500
Shut the door! Hurry!

789
01:18:27,625 --> 01:18:30,292
Baba! The Naxalites are here!

790
01:18:30,542 --> 01:18:31,583
Go to your posts.

791
01:18:31,667 --> 01:18:33,708
We are being attacked.
The damned Leftists are here.

792
01:18:34,583 --> 01:18:36,167
Shut up!
As if you didn't have your fun.

793
01:18:36,250 --> 01:18:37,500
Come inside!

794
01:18:39,250 --> 01:18:40,708
Leave none of them.

795
01:18:52,708 --> 01:18:55,667
So what did you think?
That I ran away?

796
01:18:56,292 --> 01:18:57,875
See, bitch! I'm back.

797
01:18:58,417 --> 01:19:00,292
To fix you.

798
01:19:00,708 --> 01:19:02,208
This is a revolution.

799
01:19:02,292 --> 01:19:03,625
It's spread like fire in the country.

800
01:19:03,750 --> 01:19:05,083
Now everything will change.

801
01:19:05,500 --> 01:19:07,167
No more rich! Or poor!

802
01:19:07,250 --> 01:19:08,667
No high. No low.

803
01:19:08,750 --> 01:19:10,500
All equal! Think!

804
01:19:10,625 --> 01:19:13,333
We do the slogging,
and he has the fun?

805
01:19:13,917 --> 01:19:16,875
We sweat and cry,
and he makes the money.

806
01:19:17,292 --> 01:19:18,500
No more!

807
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:22,625
Today you will decide.
Speak up.

808
01:19:24,625 --> 01:19:27,667
Anyone want to say anything about
this "landlord", Nirbhay Singh?

809
01:19:27,917 --> 01:19:30,083
This village head gobbled up my land!

810
01:19:30,917 --> 01:19:33,583
He killed my father and burnt him.

811
01:19:33,667 --> 01:19:36,792
His son, Ruab,
kidnapped my daughter.

812
01:19:38,458 --> 01:19:39,583
You have anything to say?

813
01:19:41,250 --> 01:19:42,583
Forgive me.

814
01:19:43,458 --> 01:19:44,875
Appeal rejected.

815
01:19:45,292 --> 01:19:48,375
The people's court
sentences the accused to death!

816
01:19:49,417 --> 01:19:51,250
-Long live the revolution.
-This is wrong!

817
01:19:51,958 --> 01:19:53,167
This is wrong.

818
01:19:53,625 --> 01:19:54,708
Dashrath.

819
01:19:54,917 --> 01:19:57,208
Stop right there
or I'll forget everything,

820
01:19:57,750 --> 01:20:00,542
This bastard is a blood sucker!
He killed my Lauki!

821
01:20:01,375 --> 01:20:04,750
Ruined our lives,
I'm not going to spare him.

822
01:20:06,417 --> 01:20:09,167
A gun gives one power, does it?

823
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,667
"Power flows from the barrel of a gun."

824
01:20:11,875 --> 01:20:15,375
If I can break the mountain
I can break your head too.

825
01:20:15,542 --> 01:20:16,583
Leave the Mukhiya.

826
01:20:16,667 --> 01:20:20,208
The time to talk is over.
Now it's time to act.

827
01:20:25,917 --> 01:20:26,958
Hang him.

828
01:20:32,167 --> 01:20:35,833
Long live the revolution!

829
01:20:35,917 --> 01:20:38,833
Long live the revolution!

830
01:20:48,167 --> 01:20:49,708
They hanged my father.

831
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:54,292
Dashrath, brother.

832
01:21:55,958 --> 01:21:59,625
What happened?
"Great, fantastic, alive"?

833
01:22:00,792 --> 01:22:02,292
Got scared of the guns?

834
01:22:03,458 --> 01:22:06,667
I came to report
about yesterday's incident.

835
01:22:07,042 --> 01:22:08,542
But no one is saying anything.

836
01:22:09,333 --> 01:22:10,667
Tell me one thing.

837
01:22:12,125 --> 01:22:13,250
Whatever happened...

838
01:22:14,167 --> 01:22:15,583
was it right or wrong?

839
01:22:17,250 --> 01:22:20,042
-Hey! Dashrath, brother!
-I'm a mad man!

840
01:22:22,958 --> 01:22:24,708
Why ask me about right or wrong?

841
01:22:24,875 --> 01:22:27,958
Am I responsible for all
the filth in the world?

842
01:22:29,208 --> 01:22:32,083
I don't even know
what I am doing here!

843
01:22:34,583 --> 01:22:37,458
Asking me about right and wrong...
Go mind your own business.

844
01:22:47,333 --> 01:22:48,333
You asked me...

845
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:51,417
why don't I start
my own newspaper?

846
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,917
I've published my own newspaper.
The New Dawn.

847
01:23:02,750 --> 01:23:03,792
Alok Babu.

848
01:23:08,167 --> 01:23:11,250
Great! Fantastic! Alive!

849
01:23:13,292 --> 01:23:16,667
-Can I take a photo?
-Sure, how do you want it?

850
01:23:17,750 --> 01:23:18,958
-This way?
-Yes.

851
01:23:32,708 --> 01:23:34,583
Long Live! Long Live!

852
01:23:36,958 --> 01:23:39,417
He said if I ask Madam,
the road will be made.

853
01:23:41,917 --> 01:23:45,833
Fool, see all the cops here?
They'll put you in jail!

854
01:23:46,500 --> 01:23:48,583
Long live Indira Gandhi!

855
01:23:48,667 --> 01:23:50,542
Long live Mother India!

856
01:23:50,667 --> 01:23:53,458
Long live Indira Gandhi!

857
01:23:57,125 --> 01:24:01,042
I've come here to you,

858
01:24:02,042 --> 01:24:06,958
to fulfill the dreams of
Mahatma Gandhi and Pandit Nehru.

859
01:24:07,875 --> 01:24:12,708
It's a tragedy that even after
25 years of independence

860
01:24:12,875 --> 01:24:17,917
people are fighting for basics like food,
clothing and housing.

861
01:24:18,292 --> 01:24:21,792
Whenever I say "Remove poverty,"

862
01:24:22,667 --> 01:24:26,083
the opposition says, "Remove Indira"

863
01:24:26,167 --> 01:24:30,208
I want to know from you,
what do you want?

864
01:24:35,958 --> 01:24:39,167
Help! Hurry!
Lend a shoulder, its falling.

865
01:24:42,292 --> 01:24:45,125
This hand is your hand.

866
01:24:46,500 --> 01:24:49,792
A symbol of your strength
and your labor.

867
01:24:50,083 --> 01:24:52,875
This is the hand that will
bring about change.

868
01:24:52,958 --> 01:24:57,000
This hand will write the
golden future of India.

869
01:24:57,667 --> 01:25:00,833
This very hand
will eradicate poverty.

870
01:25:01,708 --> 01:25:06,667
Today, the entire nation is screaming,
"Remove poverty!"

871
01:25:13,417 --> 01:25:14,667
Indira Gandhi...

872
01:25:14,792 --> 01:25:15,875
Long live!

873
01:25:17,958 --> 01:25:19,750
Mother India...

874
01:25:20,042 --> 01:25:21,167
Long live!

875
01:25:28,625 --> 01:25:30,250
Long live Indira Gandhi.

876
01:25:30,333 --> 01:25:31,750
Long live Mother India.

877
01:25:31,833 --> 01:25:33,708
Long live Indira Gandhi.

878
01:25:40,458 --> 01:25:42,958
Madam, I'm breaking a mountain,
please make a road there.

879
01:25:43,042 --> 01:25:44,458
Madam, he is Dashrath Manjhi.

880
01:25:44,542 --> 01:25:46,000
He's been breaking a mountain
for 12 years.

881
01:25:46,083 --> 01:25:49,000
Alone, for the wellbeing of people.
If you can help him...

882
01:25:53,500 --> 01:25:54,833
Move. Move away.

883
01:26:05,625 --> 01:26:07,333
Dashrath, brother!

884
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:10,125
Come here.

885
01:26:11,458 --> 01:26:12,542
See this.

886
01:26:14,208 --> 01:26:15,750
You have become famous,
my friend.

887
01:26:17,542 --> 01:26:20,542
See this,
your photo in the paper.

888
01:26:20,792 --> 01:26:22,167
MANJHI - MOUNTAIN MAN

889
01:26:23,042 --> 01:26:25,583
You have aged.

890
01:26:26,500 --> 01:26:28,000
Sit. Sit down. Relax.

891
01:26:30,083 --> 01:26:35,083
Now you need government help,
I will help you.

892
01:26:35,667 --> 01:26:39,583
There's an officer, very big, the BDO,
I've spoken to him.

893
01:26:40,083 --> 01:26:42,792
You'll get a government grant
to break the mountain.

894
01:26:43,958 --> 01:26:46,083
-The government will help?
-Yes.

895
01:26:46,167 --> 01:26:48,208
-For making the road?
-Yes.

896
01:26:48,833 --> 01:26:51,625
-Then it'll break in a jiffy!
-Of course.

897
01:26:51,750 --> 01:26:55,917
Now I am the village head.
Can't just see my own profit and loss.

898
01:26:57,625 --> 01:27:00,542
Forget whatever happened in the past.

899
01:27:02,167 --> 01:27:04,417
If the road is made,
everyone will benefit.

900
01:27:05,208 --> 01:27:07,333
Yes, then a proper road can be made.

901
01:27:07,417 --> 01:27:08,458
Yes.

902
01:27:08,667 --> 01:27:10,833
Motor cars will zip around
in our Gehlore.

903
01:27:11,167 --> 01:27:13,250
Reaching the hospital will be easy.

904
01:27:13,333 --> 01:27:15,833
Zip! And you'll be in Wazirgunj!

905
01:27:17,417 --> 01:27:19,500
-Zip and you're in Wazirgunj?
-Yes.

906
01:27:26,458 --> 01:27:28,458
Dashrath is doing a noble job.

907
01:27:28,917 --> 01:27:31,292
He's breaking the mountain
in memory of his wife...

908
01:27:32,500 --> 01:27:34,750
She was like a... goddess.

909
01:27:35,625 --> 01:27:37,000
Sit, brother Dashrath, sit.

910
01:27:37,542 --> 01:27:38,667
Sit.

911
01:27:45,792 --> 01:27:47,000
You're very hard working.

912
01:27:48,500 --> 01:27:50,042
We are happy with your work...

913
01:27:51,417 --> 01:27:54,125
I'm writing to the government
to help you.

914
01:27:54,208 --> 01:27:56,792
-You'll get money.
-The government is like a parent.

915
01:27:58,542 --> 01:28:00,958
Once the road is made
I can die in peace.

916
01:28:01,875 --> 01:28:03,708
Now everything will change.

917
01:28:04,375 --> 01:28:05,542
Everything will change!

918
01:28:06,042 --> 01:28:06,958
Now, you go.

919
01:28:08,375 --> 01:28:10,917
And listen, work diligently.

920
01:28:11,833 --> 01:28:15,333
When the money comes from Delhi
I'll send it through Mukhiya.

921
01:28:15,542 --> 01:28:18,875
I am an illiterate,
I don't understand money matters.

922
01:28:19,042 --> 01:28:20,375
But I will break the mountain.

923
01:28:21,250 --> 01:28:24,167
Just get a permanent road made.

924
01:28:26,917 --> 01:28:28,125
Consider it done.

925
01:28:38,542 --> 01:28:42,458
Mukhiya ji,
we are sanctioning two million.

926
01:28:44,375 --> 01:28:48,042
He won't know how many
zeroes in two million.

927
01:28:48,625 --> 01:28:52,333
BDO, sir, this is called finding
a diamond in a coal mine.

928
01:28:54,042 --> 01:28:55,125
Hello, Baba.

929
01:28:55,625 --> 01:28:56,750
Bless you.

930
01:28:59,167 --> 01:29:00,500
Baba, recognize me?

931
01:29:02,750 --> 01:29:03,917
I'm Gopal.

932
01:29:07,208 --> 01:29:10,042
As a kid,
I used to throw stones at you, Baba.

933
01:29:11,958 --> 01:29:13,792
And call you "The mad mountain man..."

934
01:29:15,250 --> 01:29:16,625
I was wrong.

935
01:29:18,042 --> 01:29:19,250
Bless you

936
01:29:22,625 --> 01:29:24,542
I want to say something to you.

937
01:29:24,667 --> 01:29:25,750
Yes, tell me.

938
01:29:28,292 --> 01:29:30,708
Even I love someone as you did.

939
01:29:31,250 --> 01:29:32,375
So do it.

940
01:29:34,625 --> 01:29:35,958
I want to marry her.

941
01:29:36,167 --> 01:29:37,458
Do it with Ã©lan.

942
01:29:40,708 --> 01:29:43,458
But my parents are not ready.
What should I do?

943
01:29:47,167 --> 01:29:49,167
I eloped with Phaguniya.

944
01:29:52,458 --> 01:29:54,250
Love has a lot of power, my child.

945
01:29:59,292 --> 01:30:01,458
Can I say something?
You won't mind?

946
01:30:01,667 --> 01:30:03,250
Why are you talking in riddles?

947
01:30:03,958 --> 01:30:04,875
Tell me.

948
01:30:06,750 --> 01:30:08,625
The one I love...

949
01:30:11,042 --> 01:30:12,208
is Rajkumariya.

950
01:30:25,833 --> 01:30:28,083
Great! Fantastic! Alive!

951
01:30:29,833 --> 01:30:33,000
Shut up, dimwit.
You'll fix my son's marriage?

952
01:30:33,542 --> 01:30:37,042
Stupid, I'm not fixing it.
They have fixed it.

953
01:30:37,333 --> 01:30:38,875
I've just come to give you
the good news.

954
01:30:38,958 --> 01:30:40,417
Here! Have some sweets.

955
01:30:40,500 --> 01:30:42,750
I don't agree. Get lost.

956
01:30:45,375 --> 01:30:46,958
They are new age kids.

957
01:30:47,292 --> 01:30:50,000
What if they elope or jump into the well?

958
01:30:51,208 --> 01:30:53,125
For 16 years I've been
breaking the mountain,

959
01:30:53,708 --> 01:30:56,333
I can break anything
but not the kid's hearts.

960
01:30:57,042 --> 01:31:00,167
Understand? Don't insult yourself
and eat some sweets.

961
01:31:00,500 --> 01:31:03,458
-You're threatening me?
-Why are you getting irritated?

962
01:31:03,917 --> 01:31:05,458
Even I have a daughter.

963
01:31:06,333 --> 01:31:08,167
Who will marry her without money?

964
01:31:08,250 --> 01:31:10,208
How will I get the money?
Will you give it to me?

965
01:31:10,667 --> 01:31:12,333
Oh, God.

966
01:31:12,542 --> 01:31:14,917
Two birds and one stone!
Tell me one thing.

967
01:31:15,333 --> 01:31:18,875
Your son, my daughter
and my son, your daughter?

968
01:31:19,708 --> 01:31:20,792
Fine?

969
01:31:21,583 --> 01:31:23,833
So what are you thinking?
Have some sweets!

970
01:31:34,042 --> 01:31:35,083
Live long.

971
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:37,458
Make your own path.

972
01:31:58,917 --> 01:32:00,917
Phaguniya would have danced
all night.

973
01:32:03,958 --> 01:32:05,250
Why don't you dance?

974
01:32:06,375 --> 01:32:08,125
Dance. Dance.

975
01:32:13,583 --> 01:32:15,542
Why are you standing like a statue?

976
01:32:15,792 --> 01:32:18,708
The kids are getting married.
You need to bless them.

977
01:32:19,333 --> 01:32:21,250
You are even older than me.

978
01:32:24,750 --> 01:32:27,667
You won't change.
Let me fix you.

979
01:32:28,833 --> 01:32:31,042
What? Let it be today?

980
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:35,458
Okay, I'll leave you today.
Enjoy!

981
01:32:48,583 --> 01:32:51,125
No more than two sips, now, you come.

982
01:32:51,875 --> 01:32:54,000
Go, throw the stones.

983
01:32:56,042 --> 01:32:57,333
You'll get more sweet water.

984
01:32:59,917 --> 01:33:01,500
Remove all the stones.

985
01:33:19,333 --> 01:33:23,250
We'll have more stones.
Come next week and collect them.

986
01:33:29,964 --> 01:33:31,214
BLOCK DEVELOPMENT OFFICE,
WAZIRGANJ (BIHAR)

987
01:33:31,306 --> 01:33:34,083
To maintain peace and order,
all necessary steps will be taken.

988
01:33:34,214 --> 01:33:35,614
SURAJ TV AND RADIO REPAIR WORKS

989
01:33:35,689 --> 01:33:40,400
Anyone who protests
will be jailed.

990
01:33:40,517 --> 01:33:43,558
The government has declared
a State of Emergency.

991
01:33:44,375 --> 01:33:45,417
Hello.

992
01:33:45,708 --> 01:33:48,458
Hello, Reporter Sahab.

993
01:33:49,583 --> 01:33:50,750
Welcome.

994
01:33:51,458 --> 01:33:52,500
Tell me.

995
01:33:52,625 --> 01:33:54,417
A grant was approved in his name.

996
01:33:54,708 --> 01:33:56,083
We've come to collect the money.

997
01:33:57,458 --> 01:33:59,417
-What is the name?
-Dashrath Manjhi.

998
01:34:06,375 --> 01:34:07,542
Dashrath Manjhi.

999
01:34:07,708 --> 01:34:08,792
Exactly.

1000
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:10,792
For breaking a mountain, right?

1001
01:34:10,875 --> 01:34:11,875
Yes.

1002
01:34:13,125 --> 01:34:14,583
But you have already
taken the money.

1003
01:34:15,875 --> 01:34:17,458
I didn't get any money.

1004
01:34:17,958 --> 01:34:19,542
Must be a mistake, do check again.

1005
01:34:19,625 --> 01:34:22,833
There's an entry in the register.
Here, see, "paid."

1006
01:34:23,042 --> 01:34:24,542
But I got no money.

1007
01:34:25,583 --> 01:34:28,208
Trying to cheat the government?

1008
01:34:28,458 --> 01:34:30,250
But I didn't get any money.

1009
01:34:31,375 --> 01:34:33,833
Wolf in a lamb's clothing, eh?

1010
01:34:33,917 --> 01:34:35,708
-Relax.
-Trying to teach me?

1011
01:34:35,792 --> 01:34:38,208
-Go away.
-Okay, understood.

1012
01:34:38,292 --> 01:34:39,583
-Go
-Understood.

1013
01:34:41,417 --> 01:34:42,625
We'll speak to the BDO come on.

1014
01:34:42,750 --> 01:34:44,250
But I didn't get any money.

1015
01:34:46,208 --> 01:34:47,542
Ruab Babu!

1016
01:34:48,958 --> 01:34:50,042
BDO, sir...

1017
01:34:50,417 --> 01:34:52,708
Why are you pissing fire?

1018
01:34:53,792 --> 01:34:56,458
The money the government sent to
break the mountain, where is it?

1019
01:34:58,708 --> 01:35:00,625
What nonsense are you talking?

1020
01:35:00,917 --> 01:35:02,208
I went to the office.

1021
01:35:02,458 --> 01:35:04,333
They said the money's gone!
So where's it gone?

1022
01:35:04,417 --> 01:35:06,167
Gone? How would I know?

1023
01:35:06,250 --> 01:35:07,792
Do you think I'm stupid?

1024
01:35:09,250 --> 01:35:12,125
Think I can't see?
New car, this gold chain...

1025
01:35:12,542 --> 01:35:14,250
I want the money to
break the mountain.

1026
01:35:14,500 --> 01:35:17,250
What money?
Which money?

1027
01:35:18,500 --> 01:35:20,167
Go. Bang your head against
the mountain.

1028
01:35:21,083 --> 01:35:23,125
Does the government have no other work?

1029
01:35:23,458 --> 01:35:25,000
You are trying to cheat me?

1030
01:35:25,417 --> 01:35:26,625
What will you do?

1031
01:35:27,500 --> 01:35:29,583
There is an emergency in the country.

1032
01:35:30,042 --> 01:35:33,333
If I put you in the jail
you won't come out alive!

1033
01:35:33,417 --> 01:35:35,417
-I'll complain.
-To whom?

1034
01:35:35,875 --> 01:35:37,583
There's no government in Bihar.

1035
01:35:37,667 --> 01:35:40,583
Go, go to Delhi.
Go bang your head there.

1036
01:35:40,667 --> 01:35:43,000
The government is listening
to everyone these days.

1037
01:35:43,083 --> 01:35:46,125
I'll go to Delhi if I have to.
But I won't spare you!

1038
01:35:48,458 --> 01:35:50,625
Delhi is very far, you moron.

1039
01:35:50,833 --> 01:35:52,667
Do you even know
which country it is in?

1040
01:35:52,833 --> 01:35:55,000
I'll find out and I will get there!

1041
01:35:55,083 --> 01:35:56,708
-Go find it.
-The fucker's a lost dog.

1042
01:35:56,875 --> 01:35:58,125
Trying to cheat me?

1043
01:35:58,208 --> 01:36:00,000
Throw him out.

1044
01:36:34,958 --> 01:36:37,000
-That I don't have, sir.
-Where are you going?

1045
01:36:37,583 --> 01:36:39,500
Delhi, to meet the Prime Minister.

1046
01:36:39,708 --> 01:36:42,208
Twenty rupees for a ticket
and 20 rupees fine, shell out 40.

1047
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:45,292
I've no money, sir.

1048
01:36:45,625 --> 01:36:47,833
Is this your dad's train?
Look at his guts!

1049
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,750
They want a free ride!
Get down, you bum.

1050
01:36:50,833 --> 01:36:52,708
I'm going to meet
the Prime minister, sir.

1051
01:36:52,792 --> 01:36:55,542
Oh?
You fucking beggar! Get down.

1052
01:37:25,250 --> 01:37:27,083
That was a little extreme.

1053
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:32,958
Have some tea.

1054
01:37:35,125 --> 01:37:36,458
Doesn't matter...

1055
01:37:38,042 --> 01:37:39,167
I'll go to Delhi.

1056
01:37:41,833 --> 01:37:42,917
On foot.

1057
01:37:43,500 --> 01:37:44,750
Are you out of your mind?

1058
01:37:44,917 --> 01:37:47,917
-Why?
-It is 1300 km.

1059
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,750
Think it's a joke? Walk to it!

1060
01:37:52,042 --> 01:37:55,333
I need to go, so I will.

1061
01:37:58,875 --> 01:38:01,833
Longing for a glimpse

1062
01:38:02,917 --> 01:38:05,542
Crazed

1063
01:38:06,750 --> 01:38:09,875
An ecstatic Fakir

1064
01:38:11,500 --> 01:38:16,000
Standing alone

1065
01:38:18,208 --> 01:38:22,625
Embracing the sky

1066
01:38:26,583 --> 01:38:29,167
O' traveler, O' traveler

1067
01:38:30,875 --> 01:38:34,125
The soldier of light

1068
01:38:35,458 --> 01:38:38,208
O' traveler, O' traveler

1069
01:38:39,958 --> 01:38:43,042
The soldier of light

1070
01:38:44,833 --> 01:38:48,750
Walk, and a path will emerge

1071
01:38:49,208 --> 01:38:52,917
Your dreams will illuminate the world

1072
01:38:55,500 --> 01:38:57,917
O' traveler, O' traveler

1073
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:21,833
Come, get up, you fool

1074
01:39:21,917 --> 01:39:24,000
Make your path

1075
01:39:24,208 --> 01:39:28,625
Smile, and celebrate life

1076
01:39:31,417 --> 01:39:33,458
The world will change

1077
01:39:33,542 --> 01:39:35,125
Only if you change

1078
01:39:35,208 --> 01:39:40,250
The story now will start with you

1079
01:39:42,750 --> 01:39:46,750
If there is a spark,
there will be a fire

1080
01:39:47,125 --> 01:39:50,542
If there is a spark,
there will be a fire

1081
01:39:57,750 --> 01:40:00,542
O' traveler, O' traveler

1082
01:40:01,917 --> 01:40:05,167
The soldier of light

1083
01:40:06,375 --> 01:40:09,333
The soldier of light

1084
01:40:15,292 --> 01:40:19,958
Destination is just a limit
of your determination

1085
01:40:20,125 --> 01:40:23,917
Desires too many
and wishes boundless

1086
01:40:24,333 --> 01:40:28,125
Destination is just a limit
of your determination

1087
01:40:28,667 --> 01:40:30,708
Who know what will happen and when

1088
01:40:30,792 --> 01:40:34,542
Only you know what you will do now

1089
01:40:36,625 --> 01:40:40,542
Your deeds will create your story

1090
01:40:40,625 --> 01:40:45,333
Your deeds will create your story

1091
01:40:47,750 --> 01:40:50,292
O' traveler, O' traveler

1092
01:40:51,833 --> 01:40:54,792
The soldier of light

1093
01:40:56,542 --> 01:40:59,375
O' traveler, O' traveler

1094
01:41:14,375 --> 01:41:16,458
LET'S GO TO DELHI. REVOLT AGAINST
THE EMERGENCY. LAY SIEGE TO THE PARLIAMENT

1095
01:41:16,583 --> 01:41:20,542
O' traveler, O' traveler

1096
01:41:20,625 --> 01:41:24,750
O' traveler, O' traveler

1097
01:41:24,833 --> 01:41:29,333
O' traveler, O' traveler

1098
01:41:29,542 --> 01:41:33,750
O' traveler, O' traveler

1099
01:41:33,958 --> 01:41:38,958
Walk, and a path will emerge

1100
01:41:41,375 --> 01:41:46,250
Your dreams will illuminate the world

1101
01:41:51,750 --> 01:41:55,167
O' traveler...

1102
01:41:58,417 --> 01:42:01,500
O' traveler...

1103
01:42:03,667 --> 01:42:05,542
Come on. Move from here.

1104
01:42:05,625 --> 01:42:07,958
This useless government

1105
01:42:08,042 --> 01:42:11,042
took your votes in the name of
removing poverty.

1106
01:42:11,125 --> 01:42:12,708
But removed the poor!

1107
01:42:12,792 --> 01:42:14,958
This poor villager,

1108
01:42:15,250 --> 01:42:17,375
all by himself,

1109
01:42:17,458 --> 01:42:20,333
has cut a path through the mountain!

1110
01:42:20,583 --> 01:42:24,333
He has walked with us all the way
from Bihar.

1111
01:42:24,958 --> 01:42:27,792
If it can't give us food or clothing...

1112
01:42:27,875 --> 01:42:29,750
The government is useless!

1113
01:42:29,833 --> 01:42:31,417
Break up, all of you!

1114
01:42:31,500 --> 01:42:33,042
Get lost! Get away!

1115
01:42:35,958 --> 01:42:38,292
-What is it?
-I need to meet the Prime Minister.

1116
01:42:38,375 --> 01:42:40,458
I know her, look at this.

1117
01:42:43,583 --> 01:42:45,042
Thousands come here every day!

1118
01:42:45,292 --> 01:42:49,167
By the Kilo! Crazy coot!
It's their job to get photographed.

1119
01:42:49,375 --> 01:42:51,000
And you useless sod,

1120
01:42:51,250 --> 01:42:53,625
get one photo clicked
and you think you are a leader?

1121
01:42:53,708 --> 01:42:56,333
"Long live mother India."

1122
01:42:57,125 --> 01:42:59,292
Take this! And after today,

1123
01:42:59,750 --> 01:43:02,875
If I see you here,
I'll shove you into the jail.

1124
01:43:03,333 --> 01:43:04,542
Load him onto the train to Bihar.

1125
01:43:04,625 --> 01:43:07,958
-Move.
-The bastard, take him away.

1126
01:43:37,083 --> 01:43:38,083
Dashrath.

1127
01:43:50,667 --> 01:43:51,958
Phaguniya!

1128
01:43:54,708 --> 01:43:56,792
You've come, after so many days!

1129
01:43:57,583 --> 01:43:58,875
What happened?

1130
01:43:59,958 --> 01:44:01,292
You were making a road,
weren't you?

1131
01:44:01,375 --> 01:44:04,125
Enough, enough already.

1132
01:44:06,167 --> 01:44:07,833
No hope anywhere.

1133
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:12,667
Nothing will ever change.
Everyone called me mad.

1134
01:44:13,042 --> 01:44:15,750
Everyone else was right.
I was wrong.

1135
01:44:18,083 --> 01:44:20,667
A little stumble and
you shatter?

1136
01:44:21,708 --> 01:44:26,583
The world is a web of deceit...
ruled by the powerful.

1137
01:44:27,042 --> 01:44:28,625
And I? I'm alone.

1138
01:44:30,042 --> 01:44:31,375
I'm tired.

1139
01:44:32,500 --> 01:44:33,625
And old.

1140
01:44:35,667 --> 01:44:37,167
Can't do this anymore.

1141
01:44:38,250 --> 01:44:42,500
Remember, Dashrath.
You took an oath to make the path.

1142
01:44:43,750 --> 01:44:46,458
This path will be made and
you will make it.

1143
01:44:46,958 --> 01:44:48,583
It's no use.

1144
01:44:50,917 --> 01:44:53,000
No one cares.

1145
01:44:55,583 --> 01:44:57,250
Nothing will change.

1146
01:44:59,708 --> 01:45:00,875
I thought...

1147
01:45:01,792 --> 01:45:04,333
you were making me a Taj Mahal.

1148
01:45:13,750 --> 01:45:15,708
Why are you staring wide eyed?

1149
01:45:16,875 --> 01:45:19,333
Pick up your hammer and chisel
and break the mountain.

1150
01:45:20,917 --> 01:45:23,542
Or I will never talk to you again.

1151
01:46:06,292 --> 01:46:10,417
Baba, you are not alone anymore!
Everyone is with you.

1152
01:46:10,500 --> 01:46:13,625
This path will now
be made very soon.

1153
01:46:17,500 --> 01:46:21,333
Great! Fantastic! Alive!

1154
01:46:39,167 --> 01:46:40,417
He broke the damn mountain.

1155
01:46:40,500 --> 01:46:42,125
And that's their leader, Dashrath.

1156
01:46:42,250 --> 01:46:43,542
You start the proceedings.

1157
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:45,083
Hey! Stop it.

1158
01:46:45,167 --> 01:46:47,500
With whose permission are
you breaking this mountain?

1159
01:46:47,917 --> 01:46:49,750
This property belongs
to the Forest Department.

1160
01:46:49,833 --> 01:46:51,083
Are you trying to grab it?

1161
01:46:51,375 --> 01:46:52,958
Who is this Dashrath Manjhi?

1162
01:46:53,792 --> 01:46:56,208
Catch the bugger!
Tie him up.

1163
01:46:57,292 --> 01:46:58,750
Bring him here.

1164
01:47:00,667 --> 01:47:03,250
Is this your dad's mountain?

1165
01:47:03,708 --> 01:47:05,208
And where are all the stones?

1166
01:47:05,625 --> 01:47:07,750
Motherfucker, gobbled them up?
Sold them?

1167
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,958
He wants to become the stone mafia.

1168
01:47:11,292 --> 01:47:16,083
No, sir, we were making a path
for the village

1169
01:47:16,708 --> 01:47:18,583
-to make it easy.
-Make it easy, eh?

1170
01:47:18,667 --> 01:47:20,833
-Easy...
-Fool!

1171
01:47:21,250 --> 01:47:23,000
Let me make it easy for you.

1172
01:47:23,375 --> 01:47:26,292
Stealing a mountain?
You think it's a joke?

1173
01:47:26,708 --> 01:47:29,250
If anyone even steps up here again.

1174
01:47:29,542 --> 01:47:33,167
Your properties will be confiscated
and you'll rot in jail.

1175
01:47:33,375 --> 01:47:35,708
Take him.

1176
01:47:37,208 --> 01:47:38,625
Get in.

1177
01:47:40,750 --> 01:47:42,833
Messing with the law, eh?

1178
01:47:46,167 --> 01:47:47,542
Bloody mountain thief.

1179
01:47:48,042 --> 01:47:50,167
For 20 years he's been breaking
the governmentâ€™s property.

1180
01:47:50,458 --> 01:47:52,625
Politics of the hammer!

1181
01:47:52,958 --> 01:47:55,875
Prosecute him in such a manner
that he dies in jail.

1182
01:47:59,583 --> 01:48:01,000
Oh, die!

1183
01:48:04,875 --> 01:48:06,292
Now, sing your hymns.

1184
01:48:07,292 --> 01:48:08,833
Your story is over.

1185
01:48:11,708 --> 01:48:15,708
Once you mess with the government,
even God has to surrender.

1186
01:48:37,250 --> 01:48:38,375
Phaguniya...

1187
01:48:40,625 --> 01:48:43,208
I feel I have lost...

1188
01:48:45,417 --> 01:48:47,167
I'll die before the task is done.

1189
01:48:50,167 --> 01:48:52,458
Maybe my love lacked something.

1190
01:48:53,875 --> 01:48:55,625
Maybe I was too weak.

1191
01:48:59,042 --> 01:49:00,792
Maybe God didn't want it.

1192
01:49:02,083 --> 01:49:03,292
Maybe...

1193
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,083
It makes no difference.

1194
01:49:14,125 --> 01:49:15,917
Release Dashrath Manjhi!

1195
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:17,542
Release him! Release him!

1196
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,292
-Who are they? What do they want?
-Don't know.

1197
01:49:22,542 --> 01:49:24,250
Then don't just stand there!
Go find out!

1198
01:49:24,333 --> 01:49:26,250
-Yes, sir.
-Release Dashrath Manjhi!

1199
01:49:26,333 --> 01:49:27,792
Release him! Release him!

1200
01:49:27,875 --> 01:49:28,875
Calm down.

1201
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:30,958
Why've you arrested him?
He's innocent.

1202
01:49:31,792 --> 01:49:33,708
Until you release him,
nobody'll leave here.

1203
01:49:35,167 --> 01:49:36,875
Release Dashrath Manjhi!

1204
01:49:38,083 --> 01:49:40,000
Sir, they have come
to get him released.

1205
01:49:40,083 --> 01:49:42,625
They say he's falsely implicated,
he's a saint.

1206
01:49:42,875 --> 01:49:46,500
They'll go on a hunger strike
until he's released.

1207
01:49:46,667 --> 01:49:48,625
Sir, I think he is a political man.

1208
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:50,750
Release Dashrath Manjhi!

1209
01:49:50,833 --> 01:49:52,708
Release him! Release him!

1210
01:49:52,792 --> 01:49:54,292
Release the joker! Hurry.

1211
01:49:54,375 --> 01:49:55,958
What about the Forest Department?

1212
01:49:56,083 --> 01:49:59,958
They stuff their faces
with bribes and we face the crap.

1213
01:50:00,042 --> 01:50:02,667
-Get him out.
-Move, move.

1214
01:50:03,042 --> 01:50:05,458
-Dashrath Baba!
-Long live!

1215
01:50:05,542 --> 01:50:07,917
-Dashrath Baba!
-Long live!

1216
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,167
-Dashrath Baba!
-Long live!

1217
01:50:10,250 --> 01:50:12,458
-Dashrath Baba!
-Long live!

1218
01:50:12,542 --> 01:50:16,208
-Dashrath Baba!
-Long live!

1219
01:50:45,958 --> 01:50:47,250
Come on!

1220
01:50:48,417 --> 01:50:50,333
-With all your might.
-Haissa.

1221
01:50:50,417 --> 01:50:51,833
-All together.
-Haissa.

1222
01:50:51,917 --> 01:50:53,792
-Louder now.
-Haissa.

1223
01:51:06,958 --> 01:51:09,167
-Dashrath Baba!
-Long live!

1224
01:52:14,417 --> 01:52:16,625
An age has gone by, in your memory...

1225
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:46,750
How much I love you!

1226
01:52:47,250 --> 01:52:48,417
So much...

1227
01:52:49,208 --> 01:52:51,333
that no mountain can stop it...

1228
01:52:52,292 --> 01:52:57,542
that sky cannot contain it,
that no one can imagine.

1229
01:53:00,833 --> 01:53:02,125
I know.

1230
01:53:29,625 --> 01:53:30,875
You've performed a miracle!

1231
01:53:31,042 --> 01:53:34,792
Dashrath Manjhi, you are a super man!
You are Mr. India!

1232
01:53:35,625 --> 01:53:38,500
Alone with a hammer and chisel!

1233
01:53:39,083 --> 01:53:43,000
Tell me, after making
the impossible, possible,

1234
01:53:43,167 --> 01:53:44,458
what would you like to say?

1235
01:53:46,083 --> 01:53:49,292
What can an illiterate
man like me say?

1236
01:53:50,333 --> 01:53:51,542
Say something.

1237
01:53:53,042 --> 01:53:55,750
I say, don't depend too much on God...

1238
01:53:57,375 --> 01:53:59,542
maybe God depends on us.

1239
01:54:32,683 --> 01:54:39,225
DASHRATH MANJHI PATHWAY
