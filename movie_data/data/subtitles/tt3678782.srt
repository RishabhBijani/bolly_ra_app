00:01:44,391 --> 00:01:48,408
BADLAPUR
(CITY OF REVENGE)

2
00:01:49,133 --> 00:01:51,258
What's the price?

3
00:01:51,758 --> 00:01:53,717
M. G. ROAD, PUNE

4
00:01:54,217 --> 00:01:55,383
Give me a fair price.

5
00:01:55,883 --> 00:01:58,008
- How much you want?
- Both of us want to buy.

6
00:01:58,508 --> 00:01:59,508
So, give us a fair price.

7
00:01:59,925 --> 00:02:01,383
I want a kilo.

8
00:02:01,883 --> 00:02:05,383
I will give it to you for Rs.10.

9
00:02:15,508 --> 00:02:16,758
- Chill.
- Do you also want?

10
00:02:17,258 --> 00:02:20,092
Which story do I tell you now? Which one?

11
00:02:20,592 --> 00:02:22,050
How much for that?

12
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:23,050
Rs. 50.

13
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:25,467
- Give me some of that.
- How about a kilo?

14
00:02:25,967 --> 00:02:29,883
No, no, no, just give me a quarter kg.
Come on hurry.

15
00:02:30,383 --> 00:02:30,758
Give it.

16
00:02:31,258 --> 00:02:33,175
- Anything else?
- No.

17
00:02:33,675 --> 00:02:34,800
Take this.

18
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:35,758
Come on.

19
00:02:36,258 --> 00:02:37,338
Shall we?

20
00:02:40,258 --> 00:02:42,508
Careful! Careful! Careful!

21
00:02:43,008 --> 00:02:44,258
Come.

22
00:02:51,633 --> 00:02:52,883
And..

23
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:55,800
And..

24
00:02:58,508 --> 00:02:59,828
- Go.
- Run!

25
00:03:02,925 --> 00:03:06,008
Come. Come. Come. Come, come fast.

26
00:03:06,508 --> 00:03:08,300
Come on. Sit in the front.

27
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,883
Come back.

28
00:03:12,383 --> 00:03:13,583
Carefully.

29
00:03:16,592 --> 00:03:17,967
Hey. Who are you?

30
00:03:18,467 --> 00:03:22,092
How dare you get into the car!
Get out ...please.

31
00:03:22,592 --> 00:03:23,842
Help!

32
00:03:25,633 --> 00:03:27,592
Stop it!

33
00:03:28,092 --> 00:03:30,717
Hey, please help.

34
00:03:31,217 --> 00:03:32,550
- Mama.
- Who are you two?

35
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:34,883
Shut up. You'll be fine.

36
00:03:35,383 --> 00:03:36,800
Faster. Faster.

37
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,217
- Hey..
- I said shut up.

38
00:03:39,717 --> 00:03:40,717
My kid...

39
00:03:41,133 --> 00:03:42,133
Sit down.

40
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:44,217
How dare you hit him? Let go.

41
00:03:44,717 --> 00:03:46,175
Let him go. I want my son.

42
00:03:46,675 --> 00:03:47,675
Robin.

43
00:03:47,925 --> 00:03:51,425
Let us go... please...

44
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:03,800
Faster! Faster! Faster!

45
00:04:08,758 --> 00:04:10,425
Faster.

46
00:04:10,925 --> 00:04:11,925
Mom!

47
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,300
Mom!

48
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,777
- Robin.
- Mom!

49
00:04:14,801 --> 00:04:17,675
Ah.. Robin.

50
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:21,050
- Robin.
- Shut up!

51
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:23,092
Robin!

52
00:04:23,592 --> 00:04:24,592
Robin!

53
00:04:25,008 --> 00:04:26,217
Stop the car! Stop the car!

54
00:04:26,717 --> 00:04:27,773
Stop the car! Stop the car!

55
00:04:27,797 --> 00:04:29,717
Stop the car! Stop the car!

56
00:04:30,217 --> 00:04:31,592
Stop the car! Stop the car!

57
00:04:32,092 --> 00:04:33,925
My kid has fallen. Stop the car!

58
00:04:34,425 --> 00:04:37,925
Stop the car!

59
00:04:41,717 --> 00:04:44,008
- I think she's dead. - Don't worry.
- What are you doing?

60
00:04:44,508 --> 00:04:48,050
Take the gun. Put it in the
same bag with the money.

61
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:50,383
Get out when I tell you to.

62
00:04:50,883 --> 00:04:51,383
Slow down! Slow down!

63
00:04:51,883 --> 00:04:53,467
Not this way. That way.

64
00:04:53,967 --> 00:04:57,467
When I say. Okay?

65
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:01,505
Jump! Go!

66
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:43,984
I didn't do anything, sir.
I am just the driver.

67
00:05:44,008 --> 00:05:45,193
The other guy did all this. He escaped.

68
00:05:45,217 --> 00:05:46,925
Take him away.

69
00:05:47,425 --> 00:05:49,008
Take him.

70
00:05:49,508 --> 00:05:52,633
Lock him up.

71
00:05:53,133 --> 00:05:56,342
Call an ambulance!

Okay, okay. Now out with the truth.
How was it?

81
00:06:33,133 --> 00:06:35,425
How was it? I think it's a fabulous idea.

82
00:06:35,925 --> 00:06:37,651
- Superb.
- I hope the boss finds it fabulous too.

83
00:06:37,675 --> 00:06:39,467
You know how he is. "O Raghu..."

84
00:06:39,967 --> 00:06:42,425
You are sassing me.

85
00:06:42,925 --> 00:06:43,984
Where did you copy this from?

86
00:06:44,008 --> 00:06:45,008
Hey... it's original.

87
00:06:45,508 --> 00:06:47,383
My wife's idea.

88
00:06:47,883 --> 00:06:49,842
She's going to live for a 100 years.

89
00:06:50,342 --> 00:06:53,842
Yeah, baby!

90
00:06:56,467 --> 00:06:58,163
- Where's the emergency ward?
- Sir... Sir..

91
00:06:58,187 --> 00:06:59,258
- Mr. Raghu.
- Yes.

92
00:06:59,508 --> 00:07:03,008
- Your wife's in room no. 320.
- Thank you.

93
00:07:08,008 --> 00:07:09,342
Sir, I received a phone call..

94
00:07:09,842 --> 00:07:12,342
Saying that my wife Misha
met with an accident.

95
00:07:12,842 --> 00:07:15,175
It wasn't an accident. It's a robbery case.

96
00:07:15,675 --> 00:07:16,652
She was shot.

97
00:07:16,676 --> 00:07:20,217
The patient is critical,
you need to come this way.

98
00:07:27,675 --> 00:07:29,425
Misha.

99
00:07:29,925 --> 00:07:30,925
Misha.

100
00:07:41,258 --> 00:07:43,883
Where is Robin?

101
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:46,258
Misha.

102
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:49,258
You'll be okay, baby.

103
00:07:49,758 --> 00:07:50,217
Everything will be fine.

104
00:07:50,717 --> 00:07:55,592
I... I can't see anything.

105
00:07:56,092 --> 00:07:57,258
I can't see you.

106
00:07:57,758 --> 00:07:59,758
- I am right here, Misha.
- Where are you?

107
00:08:00,258 --> 00:08:02,175
Right here. I am here.

108
00:08:02,675 --> 00:08:04,717
Here, baby.

109
00:08:05,217 --> 00:08:06,217
Misha, I am here.

110
00:08:06,592 --> 00:08:07,792
I am here.

111
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:11,592
I...

112
00:08:12,092 --> 00:08:16,300
I can't see anything.

113
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,675
Misha, I am here.

114
00:08:19,175 --> 00:08:21,800
- Relax. -Raghu.
- Misha.

115
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,300
Misha.

116
00:08:26,258 --> 00:08:27,717
Misha.

117
00:08:28,217 --> 00:08:30,133
Misha.

118
00:08:30,633 --> 00:08:31,633
Misha?

119
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:38,383
Can you.. Can you call the doctor?

120
00:08:38,883 --> 00:08:42,383
Can you call the doc..

121
00:08:47,717 --> 00:08:51,217
Pulse absent.

122
00:08:55,217 --> 00:08:58,717
My son Robin, where is he?

123
00:09:04,592 --> 00:09:05,569
It's a murder case now.

124
00:09:05,593 --> 00:09:08,758
I told him not to carry a gun.

125
00:09:09,258 --> 00:09:11,526
He said it was not loaded.
He said just do your job. Drive.

126
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:12,670
Who? Who is your accomplice?

127
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:14,800
Jayu! His name's Jayu. Jayant!

128
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:15,717
- Jayant?
- Yes.

129
00:09:16,217 --> 00:09:18,097
- Everyone calls him Jayu.
- Where does he live?

130
00:09:18,383 --> 00:09:19,550
- He lives in Yerwada.
- Huh!

131
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:21,092
Close to Gunjan Talkies.

132
00:09:21,592 --> 00:09:22,050
What the..

133
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:25,342
Close to the Xerox... He lives
close to the Xerox-shop.

134
00:09:25,842 --> 00:09:26,842
I see.

135
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:30,592
- How long have you known him?
- Since 3 weeks, sir.

136
00:09:31,092 --> 00:09:33,008
That is it. I wanted a job.

137
00:09:33,508 --> 00:09:35,508
He said he could get me a
job in the Middle East!

138
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:38,842
On one condition... First I had
to help him do this robbery.

139
00:09:39,342 --> 00:09:42,383
- I didn't know he had a loaded gun.
- Who fired the gun?

140
00:09:42,883 --> 00:09:44,683
- I was driving, sir.
- Huh! You were driving?

141
00:09:45,092 --> 00:09:47,258
- So who fired the gun?
- He did.

142
00:09:47,758 --> 00:09:48,758
- I see?
- Yes.

143
00:09:49,217 --> 00:09:51,800
- I was driving.
- I am just a driver.

144
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,277
I see.

145
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,800
He was supposed to get
me a job in the Gulf.

146
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:59,092
I didn't know it was loaded. I didn't know.

147
00:09:59,592 --> 00:10:03,092
Sir... they're showing it on TV.

148
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:12,550
How long? Well, the Police
are doing their job.

149
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:14,050
We are on the job.

150
00:10:14,425 --> 00:10:15,776
Catching the criminal,
and we're doing that.

151
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,984
We'll inform you as soon as
we get any information. Okay.

152
00:10:18,008 --> 00:10:21,508
- Are you hiding anything?
- Sir..

153
00:11:14,133 --> 00:11:15,300
Raghu.

154
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,133
Extremely sorry, son.

155
00:11:18,633 --> 00:11:22,133
The cremation is tomorrow at 4 pm.

156
00:12:19,383 --> 00:12:20,925
That's a lot of kidney beans.

157
00:12:21,425 --> 00:12:23,001
Are you planning to serve this all week?

158
00:12:23,025 --> 00:12:27,217
It's Chilli-Corn Carne... Mexican.

159
00:12:27,717 --> 00:12:30,300
Robbie, come eat your dinner quickly.

160
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,300
You still have to finish your
homework, don't you? Come.

161
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,360
I will either eat... or do my homework.

162
00:12:35,717 --> 00:12:37,425
Get off that Casio right away.

163
00:12:37,925 --> 00:12:39,800
Come.

164
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:43,217
Come here.

165
00:12:43,717 --> 00:12:47,508
If you eat this, I'll take you
to the dentist on Saturday.

166
00:12:48,008 --> 00:12:50,050
And if you don't, then I'll
take you to the movies.

167
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:51,050
Understood?

168
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:52,550
No, I didn't.

169
00:12:52,842 --> 00:12:54,717
Mom, what's papa saying?

170
00:12:55,217 --> 00:12:57,550
I wish I understood, son.

171
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:00,675
- How is it?
- (IN TAMIL) Very nice.

172
00:13:01,175 --> 00:13:03,092
(IN TAMIL) Scrumplicious.

173
00:13:03,592 --> 00:13:04,842
I made a little too much.

174
00:13:05,342 --> 00:13:08,842
If you love me you'll eat it all week!

175
00:13:45,217 --> 00:13:48,758
Did you find him, sir?

176
00:13:49,258 --> 00:13:50,994
He killed them, and ran
away with the loot...

177
00:13:51,018 --> 00:13:52,300
why are you hitting me?

178
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,008
Give me two days, I'll find him.

179
00:13:56,508 --> 00:13:57,804
I heard him talking to some girl.

180
00:13:57,828 --> 00:13:58,883
Kalpana! That's her name.

181
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,008
Kalpana!

182
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:02,508
She was a tall girl.

183
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:03,963
Typist...

184
00:14:07,175 --> 00:14:09,050
Can I get some weed?

185
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:11,467
It helps me think better.

186
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:15,467
You want weed?

187
00:14:47,133 --> 00:14:49,925
Son, why don't you come
back with us to Delhi?

188
00:14:50,425 --> 00:14:51,425
Come stay with us.

189
00:14:51,717 --> 00:14:53,217
We'll take care of you...

190
00:14:53,717 --> 00:14:56,383
And this place...

191
00:14:56,883 --> 00:14:58,133
I mean... there's no rush.

192
00:14:58,633 --> 00:15:01,758
You can take your time. Yeah!

193
00:15:02,258 --> 00:15:04,550
Yes, son. Papa's right.

194
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:08,842
Come with us to Delhi. Drink some juice.

195
00:15:09,342 --> 00:15:13,800
Look, Raghu. Your in-laws
aren't eating anything either.

196
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,383
Listen... rush to the supermarket..

197
00:15:16,883 --> 00:15:18,693
And get some South Indian
instant food packets.

198
00:15:18,717 --> 00:15:20,797
- I'll cook them a curry..
- Have you lost your mind?

199
00:15:21,092 --> 00:15:22,443
You're thinking about food at this time.

200
00:15:22,467 --> 00:15:23,787
But they are not eating anything.

201
00:15:24,133 --> 00:15:26,425
- But..
- I am not like you...

202
00:15:26,925 --> 00:15:28,085
to hide behind the newspaper.

203
00:15:28,425 --> 00:15:30,241
- Who's hiding behind the newspaper?
- Be quiet.

204
00:15:30,265 --> 00:15:31,675
Son, drink some juice.

205
00:15:32,175 --> 00:15:33,175
Raghu...

206
00:15:53,883 --> 00:15:55,383
Last night we called our artist..

207
00:15:55,883 --> 00:15:59,092
To make a sketch of his partner.

208
00:15:59,592 --> 00:16:02,425
And the result was this.

209
00:16:02,925 --> 00:16:04,800
Do you know who he is?

210
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:08,883
Ranjeet! The actor!

211
00:16:09,383 --> 00:16:10,967
He's taking us for a ride.

212
00:16:11,467 --> 00:16:14,967
Sir, can I meet him?

213
00:16:30,633 --> 00:16:32,133
I know how you are feeling Sir...

214
00:16:32,633 --> 00:16:36,925
I can feel your pain.

215
00:16:37,425 --> 00:16:38,425
I can feel your pain.

216
00:16:38,842 --> 00:16:42,383
What happened was terrible.

217
00:16:42,883 --> 00:16:46,508
Jayu shot her, I already
told the inspector.

218
00:16:47,008 --> 00:16:48,258
Jayu!

219
00:16:50,717 --> 00:16:52,175
Can I have a minute with him?

220
00:16:52,675 --> 00:16:53,717
May I?

221
00:16:54,217 --> 00:16:57,092
I think they bumped off Jayu.

222
00:16:57,592 --> 00:16:59,717
And took the entire loot.

223
00:17:00,217 --> 00:17:01,967
I don't trust these cops.

224
00:17:02,467 --> 00:17:07,092
Maybe they split the loot 50-50.

225
00:17:07,592 --> 00:17:09,592
Honestly.

226
00:17:10,092 --> 00:17:11,300
I didn't shoot her.

227
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,800
Shut up.

228
00:17:13,175 --> 00:17:16,675
You were there too.

229
00:17:19,717 --> 00:17:20,800
Hold him!

230
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:24,800
- Why did you kill her?
- Leave him.

231
00:17:27,842 --> 00:17:28,842
Let go off.

232
00:17:29,217 --> 00:17:30,758
It was you.

233
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:34,883
You're the culprit. You rogue.

234
00:17:35,383 --> 00:17:36,383
Raghu!

235
00:17:36,675 --> 00:17:39,175
Have you lost your mind?
You want to kill him?

236
00:17:39,675 --> 00:17:43,633
I will lose my job because of you.

237
00:17:44,133 --> 00:17:45,258
Take him away.

238
00:17:45,758 --> 00:17:49,258
What are you staring at?

239
00:18:00,883 --> 00:18:01,883
Raghu!

240
00:18:03,342 --> 00:18:04,342
The phone's ringing?

241
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,550
Nobody's picking up.

242
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:08,250
Nobody's picking up the phone.

243
00:18:08,467 --> 00:18:11,967
Maybe he's not home.

244
00:18:29,258 --> 00:18:32,467
- Is Mr. Joshi at home?
- Come in.

245
00:18:32,967 --> 00:18:33,967
Sit.

246
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:48,633
R Joshi, private detective. That's me.

247
00:18:49,133 --> 00:18:51,425
Sorry. I didn't attend my yoga class today.

248
00:18:51,925 --> 00:18:53,485
This is the best exercise, to keep fit.

249
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:54,860
Come in.

250
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:56,508
I am sorry about your family..

251
00:18:57,008 --> 00:19:00,508
The cops couldn't get the accomplice
in all these days... you think I can?

252
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:46,092
Hey... want a drink?

253
00:19:46,592 --> 00:19:47,758
In here?

254
00:19:48,258 --> 00:19:49,925
Name it and you can get it here.

255
00:19:50,425 --> 00:19:53,925
- Want some?
- Come on.

256
00:20:29,717 --> 00:20:33,217
Michael sir, salute him.

257
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:46,800
- Cheers.
- Cheers! - Cheers!

258
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,500
Come here.

259
00:20:55,258 --> 00:21:00,133
Where's the loot? Who has it?

260
00:21:00,633 --> 00:21:06,675
Will you speak up... or do we
make you the local Draupadi?

261
00:21:07,175 --> 00:21:10,758
You didn't get it? Explain it to him.

262
00:21:11,258 --> 00:21:12,800
Come on.

263
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,467
Round... turn around..

264
00:21:15,967 --> 00:21:16,967
Bravo.

265
00:21:20,592 --> 00:21:23,092
Amazing.

266
00:21:23,592 --> 00:21:27,050
Come here... gorgeous.

267
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:28,550
Where is the loot?

268
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,425
Can I get a drink?

269
00:21:35,925 --> 00:21:38,092
She wants a drink eh?

270
00:21:38,592 --> 00:21:39,592
Idiot..

271
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:42,508
Get him!

272
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,300
Check the bag.

273
00:22:05,633 --> 00:22:06,842
You can go in.

274
00:22:07,342 --> 00:22:08,592
Next.

275
00:22:16,133 --> 00:22:19,633
You good for nothing!

276
00:22:28,133 --> 00:22:30,276
Shame on you... You haven't
stopped your antics in here too.

277
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:31,675
How did you get hurt? Speak up.

278
00:22:32,175 --> 00:22:34,383
Are you done? Have you brought my clothes?

279
00:22:34,883 --> 00:22:38,425
I did. It's outside.

280
00:22:38,925 --> 00:22:40,541
How long are they going to keep you here?

281
00:22:40,565 --> 00:22:44,467
I don't know how long.
I haven't done anything.

282
00:22:44,967 --> 00:22:47,967
Are you guilty of killing
that woman and child?

283
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:50,633
I said it a thousand times.
I haven't done anything.

284
00:22:51,133 --> 00:22:53,675
- I didn't kill them.
- Swear on me.

285
00:22:54,175 --> 00:22:56,800
You think they'll free me if I do?

286
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:00,800
Go back to the shop.

287
00:23:09,758 --> 00:23:12,383
Hello... excuse me.

288
00:23:12,883 --> 00:23:16,925
- Are you heading towards the station?
- Yes.

289
00:23:17,425 --> 00:23:18,550
Can we go together?

290
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:21,258
We can share the fare.

291
00:23:21,758 --> 00:23:23,050
- Okay.
- Yes.

292
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:26,383
- Please..
- No.

293
00:23:26,883 --> 00:23:30,508
- I own a tea shop myself.
- I see.

294
00:23:31,008 --> 00:23:34,217
What are you doing here?

295
00:23:34,717 --> 00:23:37,300
My sister-in-law framed my brother.

296
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,508
I swear my brother's a noble man.

297
00:23:41,008 --> 00:23:42,383
He's been sentenced for 5 years..

298
00:23:42,883 --> 00:23:48,133
- I swear he hasn't done anything.
- It's okay.

299
00:23:48,633 --> 00:23:53,050
- What are you doing here?
- My son..

300
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:55,508
Good for nothing guy...

301
00:23:56,008 --> 00:23:58,175
wants to marry a whore...

302
00:23:58,675 --> 00:24:00,425
A whore?

303
00:24:00,925 --> 00:24:04,008
What is your daughter-in-law's business?

304
00:24:04,508 --> 00:24:08,008
You are a woman, you should know
what business she will be having.

305
00:24:08,508 --> 00:24:11,592
Where did he find this awful girl?

306
00:24:12,092 --> 00:24:13,092
Real name Jhimli.

307
00:24:13,508 --> 00:24:16,383
Professional name... Shabnum.

308
00:24:16,883 --> 00:24:19,092
She charges 5000 for 2 hours.

309
00:24:19,592 --> 00:24:24,133
And I charge 2000 for 24 hours.
How about that?

310
00:24:24,633 --> 00:24:26,550
Liak and she were born in the same village.

311
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:28,370
Grew up in the same neighborhood.

312
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:31,883
Childhood friends. Liak is crazy about her.

313
00:24:32,383 --> 00:24:33,550
She operates from Mumbai.

314
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:38,092
There's a Shagun Beauty
Parlor near Regal Cinema.

315
00:24:38,592 --> 00:24:40,342
Ask for Mukesh aka 'Mamu'.

316
00:24:40,842 --> 00:24:42,092
He's the pimp.

317
00:24:42,592 --> 00:24:44,432
- I want to meet Shabnam.
- 10,000 for 2 hours.

318
00:24:44,758 --> 00:24:46,550
Get to this address by 8.

319
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:50,133
I've sent a freshie. Charged him double.

320
00:24:50,633 --> 00:24:54,133
Strip him clean.

00:26:20,592 --> 00:26:21,592
Hey...

337
00:26:23,383 --> 00:26:25,300
Extra for tearing up my dress.

338
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,842
Okay.

339
00:26:27,342 --> 00:26:30,022
They are expensive, not the cheap
stuff one gets on Fashion Street.

340
00:26:30,425 --> 00:26:33,467
My top's worth 4000.

341
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:38,717
How much do you make in a day, Jhimli?

342
00:26:39,217 --> 00:26:41,175
Who are you?

343
00:26:41,675 --> 00:26:42,675
How do you know my name?

344
00:26:42,925 --> 00:26:44,133
What is Liak's partner's name?

345
00:26:44,633 --> 00:26:46,842
Liak who?

346
00:26:47,342 --> 00:26:48,342
Your boyfriend.

347
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:49,675
I don't have a boyfriend.

348
00:26:50,175 --> 00:26:51,351
Everyone here is my boyfriend.

349
00:26:51,375 --> 00:26:54,300
- Untie me or I will scream..
- Scream!

350
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:58,300
Call the police.

351
00:27:00,425 --> 00:27:02,550
Who are you?

352
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:04,050
Who are you?

353
00:27:04,425 --> 00:27:11,383
I am the one whose wife and kid
died in the bank that day.

354
00:27:11,883 --> 00:27:12,883
Sir...

355
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:15,550
Sir... forgive me.

356
00:27:16,008 --> 00:27:20,383
I'll tell you. I'll tell you everything.

357
00:27:20,883 --> 00:27:21,883
I know Liak.

358
00:27:22,383 --> 00:27:24,133
He's a friend... for many years.

359
00:27:24,633 --> 00:27:26,342
He loves me too.

360
00:27:26,842 --> 00:27:28,633
But he didn't like me working here.

361
00:27:29,133 --> 00:27:31,592
No one does this job willingly.

362
00:27:32,092 --> 00:27:34,675
But I was helpless.

363
00:27:35,175 --> 00:27:36,842
2 months ago Liak paid a visit.

364
00:27:37,342 --> 00:27:40,342
He said he'll get me out of here.

365
00:27:40,842 --> 00:27:43,675
And two days later I saw on TV..

366
00:27:44,175 --> 00:27:45,351
He's a fraudster and thief...

367
00:27:45,375 --> 00:27:48,342
but he's no murderer.

368
00:27:48,842 --> 00:27:50,092
Sir..

369
00:28:02,258 --> 00:28:06,217
I got 3.5 million on my
son's life-insurance.

370
00:28:06,717 --> 00:28:08,342
You can take it all.

371
00:28:08,842 --> 00:28:13,300
Just tell me who Liak's partner is.

372
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,550
Warshid Akhtar.

373
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:20,550
Liak Mohammed.

374
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:24,550
Anand Kamble.

375
00:28:27,508 --> 00:28:28,485
You?

376
00:28:28,509 --> 00:28:29,925
What have you done?

377
00:28:30,425 --> 00:28:31,967
I didn't kill them.

378
00:28:32,467 --> 00:28:34,843
I'm tired of telling everyone.
But no one's ready to listen.

379
00:28:34,867 --> 00:28:36,901
If you didn't kill them, then
why are you protecting him?

380
00:28:36,925 --> 00:28:39,925
Become an approver.
You'll face lesser sentence.

381
00:28:40,425 --> 00:28:43,342
I am ready, but where will I find him.

382
00:28:43,842 --> 00:28:46,342
The Police have killed
him and kept the loot.

383
00:28:46,842 --> 00:28:48,442
Forget it, say something dirty. Come on.

384
00:28:48,883 --> 00:28:49,217
What?

385
00:28:49,717 --> 00:28:53,592
You know... these days I talk to you a lot.

386
00:28:54,092 --> 00:28:56,383
- I speak your lines too.
- Which lines?

387
00:28:56,883 --> 00:28:59,467
The noises you make... Please, no!
Please, no!

388
00:28:59,967 --> 00:29:01,127
- Please, no!
- Are you crazy?

389
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:03,550
- You're in jail.
- Come on.

390
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:05,050
Do it.

391
00:29:05,258 --> 00:29:07,008
Just once.

392
00:29:07,508 --> 00:29:10,133
Raghav visited me yesterday.

393
00:29:10,633 --> 00:29:13,008
He knows my name.

394
00:29:13,508 --> 00:29:15,092
How did he find you?

395
00:29:15,592 --> 00:29:17,550
He was asking for your partner's name.

396
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:20,133
He said he'll pay me.

397
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:23,092
Otherwise he was threatening
to go to the police.

398
00:29:23,592 --> 00:29:24,842
Hmm..

399
00:29:28,633 --> 00:29:29,675
So what will you do now?

400
00:29:30,175 --> 00:29:33,883
He said he same things he told the police.

401
00:29:34,383 --> 00:29:35,925
He didn't say anything more.

402
00:29:36,425 --> 00:29:37,425
I am sorry.

403
00:29:37,633 --> 00:29:38,883
Did you tell him about me?

404
00:29:39,383 --> 00:29:40,623
Why would I tell him about you?

405
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:44,133
I just asked him generally.

406
00:29:44,633 --> 00:29:45,610
Did he say anything else?

407
00:29:45,634 --> 00:29:48,675
He just kept staring at me for a while.

408
00:29:49,175 --> 00:29:53,133
He was happy to see me.

409
00:29:53,633 --> 00:29:56,008
You're happy too?

410
00:29:56,508 --> 00:29:57,883
Were you happy?

411
00:29:58,383 --> 00:30:03,342
Look... I went there
because you asked me to.

412
00:30:03,842 --> 00:30:05,298
And I don't think he's done anything.

413
00:30:05,322 --> 00:30:06,762
The poor guy's is innocent. Trapped.

414
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,133
And he won't lie to me.

415
00:30:08,633 --> 00:30:12,883
Don't waste your time and money.

416
00:30:13,383 --> 00:30:15,258
And cough up my money too.

417
00:30:15,758 --> 00:30:17,675
I've to pay commission to Mukesh as well.

418
00:30:18,175 --> 00:30:21,675
And so many other expenses too.

419
00:30:25,717 --> 00:30:26,717
Thank you.

420
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:28,250

Go back.

453
00:33:05,508 --> 00:33:07,967
Keep him back.

Mr. Raghav, your wife and child died..

During the Jan-Laxmi
Sahakari Bank heist.

458
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:17,766
The Court has sentenced Liak
to 20 years of imprisonment.

How do you feel?

460

Isn't he from that TV serial?

485
00:35:18,467 --> 00:35:20,050
Why would a TV actor travel on a train?

- If we can, so can he!
- He can't!

Mister, aren't you Kusum's

Did you take part in "Kaun Banega Crorepati
(WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE)"?

Yes, I think I had seen him.

00:41:37,675 --> 00:41:41,175
So we can get the crow out.

542
00:43:00,883 --> 00:43:01,883
Get him!

543
00:43:29,050 --> 00:43:31,675
- I did meet him... in Tihar jail.
- Who?

544
00:43:32,175 --> 00:43:34,675
Charles Shobraj.

545
00:43:35,175 --> 00:43:36,800
What a deadly man.

546
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:39,133
Amazing personality.

547
00:43:39,633 --> 00:43:41,793
- He escaped from jail 14 times.
- What are you saying?

548
00:43:42,092 --> 00:43:45,300
Afghanistan... Paris... Bangkok.

549
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:47,425
- He even broke out of Tihar.
- I see.

550
00:43:47,925 --> 00:43:49,217
And this Kaalia..

551
00:43:49,717 --> 00:43:50,717
Hey Kaalia..

552
00:43:51,050 --> 00:43:54,758

553
00:43:55,258 --> 00:43:59,675

555
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:03,508
Congratulations, Liak.

556
00:44:04,008 --> 00:44:07,550
This time you made it out of the gates.

557
00:44:08,050 --> 00:44:11,550
Keep at it... you will definitely make it
to the bus stop in another 10-12 years.

558
00:44:17,425 --> 00:44:20,925
Catch him someone..

559
00:44:40,758 --> 00:44:41,883
I didn't do anything.

560
00:44:42,383 --> 00:44:45,883
He just fell down!

00:45:13,717 --> 00:45:16,342

576
00:46:08,717 --> 00:46:12,217
Mr. Raghav?

577
00:46:13,842 --> 00:46:16,425
Thank God! I should be given
a medal for finding you.

578
00:46:16,925 --> 00:46:17,925
May I come in?

579
00:46:18,217 --> 00:46:20,737
- I don't want to buy anything.
- No, I am not selling anything.

580
00:46:21,008 --> 00:46:22,008
Please.

581
00:46:22,258 --> 00:46:23,458
Thank you.

582
00:46:28,467 --> 00:46:29,467
Shobha.

583
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:33,675
I run a NGO. Prayaas.

584
00:46:34,175 --> 00:46:39,925
We work towards
rehabilitating jail inmates.

585
00:46:40,425 --> 00:46:43,925
Actually...

586
00:46:45,633 --> 00:46:48,217
I am here because of Liak.

587
00:46:48,717 --> 00:46:50,467
Liak Tungekar.

588
00:46:50,967 --> 00:46:52,633
He's got stomach cancer.

589
00:46:53,133 --> 00:46:55,425
He's got only a year.

590
00:46:55,925 --> 00:46:56,925
What do you want?

591
00:46:57,175 --> 00:46:59,133
He can be released on medical grounds.

592
00:46:59,633 --> 00:47:00,967
Seek treatment.

593
00:47:01,467 --> 00:47:04,425
He can live the rest of
his life respectably.

594
00:47:04,925 --> 00:47:09,092
If... you give him a pardon letter.

595
00:47:09,592 --> 00:47:11,550
- Is he in pain?
- Excuse me?

596
00:47:12,050 --> 00:47:13,300
Pain?

597
00:47:15,175 --> 00:47:17,800
Not yet, but... he's undergoing Chemo.

598
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:21,383
He should have been publicly
hanged 15 years ago.

599
00:47:21,883 --> 00:47:23,050
But this isn't bad either.

600
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:27,050
He'll die a slow death.

601
00:47:35,508 --> 00:47:36,734
Actually... you've come all the way here..

602
00:47:36,758 --> 00:47:39,008
To give me this news, so thank you.

603
00:47:39,508 --> 00:47:40,633
- Ms...?
- Shobha.

604
00:47:41,133 --> 00:47:42,675
Shobha.

605
00:47:43,175 --> 00:47:45,133
I feel like celebrating today.

606
00:47:45,633 --> 00:47:46,967
I might order a Chinese meal.

607
00:47:47,467 --> 00:47:50,133
Raghav, Liak's been in jail for 15 years.

608
00:47:50,633 --> 00:47:52,175
He's sick, and he's dying.

609
00:47:52,675 --> 00:47:54,425
And all he asks is to die outside jail.

610
00:47:54,925 --> 00:47:57,717
In his own home, close to his mother.

611
00:47:58,217 --> 00:48:00,508
Only you can fulfill his last wish.

612
00:48:01,008 --> 00:48:05,133
So please... forgive him.

613
00:48:05,633 --> 00:48:08,008
Do you have kids, Ms. Shobha.

614
00:48:08,508 --> 00:48:11,925
I have a daughter... Nitasha.

615
00:48:12,425 --> 00:48:15,925
She's in the 4th grade.

616
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:24,842
Imagine if someone like Liak abducts
your daughter, and kills her.

617
00:48:25,342 --> 00:48:26,822
And you have see her dissected body..

618
00:48:27,092 --> 00:48:33,008
In the post mortem
room of some hospital.

619
00:48:33,508 --> 00:48:40,633
Will you forgive?
Because it's been 15 years?

620
00:48:41,133 --> 00:48:43,133
I don't know.

621
00:48:43,633 --> 00:48:44,633
But I do know...

622
00:48:44,925 --> 00:48:48,383
that people can change
after spending time in jail.

623
00:48:48,883 --> 00:48:50,550
Meet him once.

624
00:48:51,050 --> 00:48:56,842
See for yourself, and then decide.

625
00:48:57,342 --> 00:48:58,717
I've brought his reports.

626
00:48:59,217 --> 00:49:04,050
I just want to show you all these things.

627
00:49:04,550 --> 00:49:05,750
Goodnight.

628
00:49:19,342 --> 00:49:20,967
I've left my card.

629
00:49:21,467 --> 00:49:26,258
In case you change your mind.

630
00:49:26,758 --> 00:49:28,800
Be careful at the over-bridge.

631
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:33,300
It gets foggy during the monsoons.

632
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:38,258
With or without your help...
Liak will find release in a year.

633
00:49:38,758 --> 00:49:40,633
That's the decision of God.

634
00:49:41,133 --> 00:49:43,092
But what about you?

635
00:49:43,592 --> 00:49:47,467
You don't even have a picture of
your wife and child in this house.

636
00:49:47,967 --> 00:49:51,467
You're in a prison yourself.

637
00:51:23,008 --> 00:51:25,133
Mr. Raghav?

638
00:51:25,633 --> 00:51:27,592
Govind Mishra, remember?

639
00:51:28,092 --> 00:51:31,800
Three promotions, two bypass surgeries!

640
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:34,425
I am retiring at the end of the month.

641
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:39,008
But an open case still hurts.

642
00:51:39,508 --> 00:51:43,925
If Liak is released, he will
surely contact his partner.

643
00:51:44,425 --> 00:51:47,925
And then you will catch him, right?

644
00:51:51,008 --> 00:51:52,633
Madam, fruits aren't allowed inside.

645
00:51:53,133 --> 00:51:54,383
Let him take it.

646
00:51:54,883 --> 00:51:55,883
- Okay.
- Thank you.

647
00:51:56,133 --> 00:51:57,133
Yadav.

648
00:52:16,425 --> 00:52:19,883
Thank you, sir.

649
00:52:20,383 --> 00:52:23,258
If you forgive me, I can get out of here.

650
00:52:23,758 --> 00:52:27,967
They say I've got only
one year left to live.

651
00:52:28,467 --> 00:52:29,467
My life's..

652
00:52:29,925 --> 00:52:33,633
My life's ruined.

653
00:52:34,133 --> 00:52:40,550
I feel terrible about what
happened to your family.

654
00:52:41,050 --> 00:52:44,508
I've heard all this 15 years ago.

655
00:52:45,008 --> 00:52:48,050
Tell me something new.

656
00:52:48,550 --> 00:52:50,008
Shall I?

657
00:52:50,508 --> 00:52:54,050
I feel so terrible about your family..

658
00:52:54,550 --> 00:52:57,030
The first thing I'll do after
getting out is meet my partner..

659
00:52:57,342 --> 00:52:59,092
Take my share of the loot.

660
00:52:59,592 --> 00:53:05,717
And have a good time with
Jhimli for 10 months.

661
00:53:06,217 --> 00:53:08,758
No, Liak.

662
00:53:09,258 --> 00:53:12,633
There's just one way to get out of here.

663
00:53:13,133 --> 00:53:14,453
Tell me the name of your partner.

664
00:53:14,842 --> 00:53:17,008
How can I tell you what I don't know?

665
00:53:17,508 --> 00:53:21,008
- I tried telling the police..
- You're going to die here.

666
00:53:24,592 --> 00:53:26,550
You have a family?

667
00:53:27,050 --> 00:53:28,842
A Daughter.

668
00:53:29,342 --> 00:53:32,842
- Don't you find this job tough?
- Yes.

669
00:53:36,883 --> 00:53:37,342
Raghu?

670
00:53:37,842 --> 00:53:39,042

Sir, I am Liak's mother.

687
00:55:23,675 --> 00:55:25,435
Forgive me, but I am not
signing any letter.

688
00:55:25,675 --> 00:55:27,800
- Sir..
- Sorry.

689
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:33,425
Sir, I know who was
Liak's partner in crime.

690
00:55:33,925 --> 00:55:34,925
Sir.

691
00:55:38,425 --> 00:55:42,383
I know... his partner's name.

692
00:55:42,883 --> 00:55:45,050
- Did Liak send you?
- No, sir.

693
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:49,092
He'll kill me if he finds out.

694
00:55:49,592 --> 00:55:52,883
Last week he called me from jail.

695
00:55:53,383 --> 00:55:56,050
He told me his partner's name..

696
00:55:56,550 --> 00:55:57,790
And asked me to contact him.

697
00:55:58,092 --> 00:56:01,717
I've got his phone number and address.

698
00:56:02,217 --> 00:56:04,342
Don't let my son die in jail.

699
00:56:04,842 --> 00:56:06,800
Come in.

700
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:09,175
- Forgive him.
- Come in.

701
00:56:09,675 --> 00:56:11,715
You know his partner's name
and address, don't you?

702
00:56:11,925 --> 00:56:15,425
- Yes, sir.
- Come... please sit.

703
00:56:20,967 --> 00:56:21,944
Sir.

704
00:56:21,968 --> 00:56:24,249
Sir, I have been blessed with a baby girl.
Sweets for you.

705
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:25,420
- Congrats.
- Thank you, sir.

706
00:56:25,883 --> 00:56:27,776
Sir, you've to come over
for the naming ceremony.

707
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:32,133
- Sorry, I am going on a break.
- Are you going home?

708
00:56:32,633 --> 00:56:33,633
Yes.

709
00:56:52,217 --> 00:56:54,800
On 27th May, 2000 Liak Tungekar..

710
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:58,967
And his missing accomplice murdered
my wife Misha and son Robin.

711
00:56:59,467 --> 00:57:01,008
During a bank heist.

712
00:57:01,508 --> 00:57:03,428
The court sentenced Liak
to 20 years in prison..

713
00:57:03,717 --> 00:57:05,633
Of which he has served 15.

714
00:57:06,133 --> 00:57:08,967
Last week I was informed that
Liak is suffering from cancer.

715
00:57:09,467 --> 00:57:10,483
I can never forgive him...

716
00:57:10,507 --> 00:57:13,425
the senseless deaths
of my wife and child...

717
00:57:13,925 --> 00:57:16,925
And yet, Liak dying in jail
won't give me any solace.

718
00:57:17,425 --> 00:57:21,967
I request the court to cut short
the remainder of Liak's sentence.

719
00:57:22,467 --> 00:57:23,547
I want him to be released..

720
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:26,508
So that he can receive treatment
and live the rest of his..

721
00:57:27,008 --> 00:57:30,508
Life with dignity.

722
00:57:34,633 --> 00:57:36,592
I am going... to the bus stop.

723
00:57:37,092 --> 00:57:38,883
And then straight to Bangkok.

724
00:57:39,383 --> 00:57:41,675
I'll get all the massages.
Thai... Sandwich... the works!

725
00:57:42,175 --> 00:57:43,276
Give him a good foot massage ok...

726
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:46,800
Do it correctly, okay?

727
00:58:05,050 --> 00:58:06,300
Yeah.

728
00:58:08,133 --> 00:58:12,925
But why did you break the legs?

729
00:58:13,425 --> 00:58:16,592
They're foreigners; They want
the entire roast chicken.

730
00:58:17,092 --> 00:58:17,592
Yeah.

731
00:58:18,092 --> 00:58:20,092
Good morning, sir. It's on the third floor.

732
00:58:20,592 --> 00:58:21,592
See you.

733
00:59:50,606 --> 00:59:51,606
Shit!

734
01:00:18,366 --> 01:00:19,802
Excuse me, do you need help.

735
01:00:19,826 --> 01:00:22,926
No, I am fine. Thanks.

736
01:00:25,092 --> 01:00:26,342
Okay.

737
01:00:35,759 --> 01:00:38,509
Listen... I said I don't need help.

738
01:00:39,009 --> 01:00:41,717
My husband's on his way to pick me up.

739
01:00:42,217 --> 01:00:45,176
You can... go.

740
01:00:45,676 --> 01:00:47,509
- Do you read the papers?
- What?

741
01:00:48,009 --> 01:00:49,467
This area isn't safe.

742
01:00:49,967 --> 01:00:53,884
Recently there's been a few
robberies and a murder.

743
01:00:54,384 --> 01:00:57,759
Don't worry, I'll wait here
until your husband arrives.

744
01:00:58,259 --> 01:01:03,092
No, no, no, I am fine. Really.

745
01:01:03,592 --> 01:01:05,467
If you wish, I'll wait by your car.

746
01:01:05,967 --> 01:01:07,759
You can take my car.

747
01:01:08,259 --> 01:01:11,759
There's a petrol pump up
ahead, you can get help.

748
01:01:19,426 --> 01:01:22,676
- Do you watch films?
- Sometimes.

749
01:01:23,176 --> 01:01:26,301
When a girl asks for a lift on
a deserted road at night...

750
01:01:26,801 --> 01:01:29,259
either the driver's a serial
killer, or the girl's a ghost.

751
01:01:29,759 --> 01:01:31,176
You think negative.

752
01:01:31,676 --> 01:01:33,217
It can be a romantic film too.

753
01:01:33,717 --> 01:01:37,926
<i>♪ I met a beautiful stranger.. ♪</i>

754
01:01:38,426 --> 01:01:40,259
Okay, okay...

755
01:01:40,759 --> 01:01:43,592
I've a big-tough husband,
and he has your number.

756
01:01:44,092 --> 01:01:46,509
- Really?
- Of course, I just messaged him.

757
01:01:47,009 --> 01:01:49,129
Whether you're a lover or a killer,
you'll be caught.

758
01:01:49,426 --> 01:01:51,842
- Already caught, madam.
- Oh, you're married.

759
01:01:52,342 --> 01:01:53,342
Thank God for that.

760
01:01:53,717 --> 01:01:55,842
I was really scared.

761
01:01:56,342 --> 01:01:57,467
Lovely.

762
01:01:57,967 --> 01:01:59,259
And he's so adorable.

763
01:01:59,759 --> 01:02:02,009
- What are their names?
- Misha. Robin.

764
01:02:02,509 --> 01:02:06,217
Oh... very cute.

765
01:02:06,717 --> 01:02:07,717
Was it a love-marriage?

766
01:02:08,134 --> 01:02:11,009
Oh... so sorry. I am just
returning from a wedding, so..

767
01:02:11,509 --> 01:02:12,925
That's the only thing on my mind.

768
01:02:12,949 --> 01:02:15,217
- You don't have to answer that at all.
- Love marriage.

769
01:02:15,717 --> 01:02:19,217
Ours was a love-marriage too.

770
01:02:24,467 --> 01:02:25,467
It's here?

771
01:02:25,759 --> 01:02:29,426
Yes, on the left.

772
01:02:29,926 --> 01:02:33,426
Thank you. Thank you so much,
I really appreciate it.

773
01:02:33,926 --> 01:02:38,967
- Coffee?
- Won't your husband be at home?

774
01:02:39,467 --> 01:02:41,134
Actually, we own a restaurant.

775
01:02:41,634 --> 01:02:42,777
- Konkan Queen.
- Is that yours?

776
01:02:42,801 --> 01:02:43,817
Yes, it's in Vimaan Nagar.

777
01:02:43,841 --> 01:02:45,551
It's the best sea food in Pune.

778
01:02:46,051 --> 01:02:48,027
- Why don't you bring Misha and Robin along?
- Yeah.

779
01:02:48,051 --> 01:02:49,384
Please come. Okay.

780
01:02:49,884 --> 01:02:51,217
- Kanchan.
- Raghu.

781
01:02:51,717 --> 01:02:55,217
Take care, Kanchan.

782
01:03:57,551 --> 01:03:58,842
- Hi.
- Surprise!

783
01:03:59,342 --> 01:04:01,009
Oh, my God. What a pleasant surprise.

784
01:04:01,509 --> 01:04:02,634
- Did you meet Harman?
- No.

785
01:04:03,134 --> 01:04:04,134
Hold on.

786
01:04:09,759 --> 01:04:11,217
This is Raghu... Harman.

787
01:04:11,717 --> 01:04:12,926
He dropped me home last night.

788
01:04:13,426 --> 01:04:14,717
Hello, Harman.

789
01:04:15,217 --> 01:04:15,634
Thank you.

790
01:04:16,134 --> 01:04:18,634
- Sit.
- Yeah.

791
01:04:19,134 --> 01:04:22,759
You didn't bring Misha and Robin along?

792
01:04:23,259 --> 01:04:25,217
- They are no more.
- What?

793
01:04:25,717 --> 01:04:31,009
Actually, they died 15 years
ago during a bank heist.

794
01:04:31,509 --> 01:04:31,842
I am so sorry.

795
01:04:32,342 --> 01:04:34,318
I didn't get the opportunity
to tell you last night.

796
01:04:34,342 --> 01:04:35,662
And you were already so stressed.

797
01:04:36,009 --> 01:04:37,409
I didn't want to bring up the past.

798
01:04:37,759 --> 01:04:40,176
Oh my God. I am really sorry.
What a tragedy.

799
01:04:40,676 --> 01:04:43,384
No, the real tragedy is
that it's been 15 years..

800
01:04:43,884 --> 01:04:47,384
And the murderer is still at large.

801
01:04:50,009 --> 01:04:52,676
I am very hungry.
What's the specialty here?

802
01:04:53,176 --> 01:04:56,676
I'll just get it. You'll love it.

803
01:05:01,134 --> 01:05:02,134
Cheers.

804
01:05:19,634 --> 01:05:22,967
Have we met before?

805
01:05:23,467 --> 01:05:25,551
You have met my wife and child.

806
01:05:26,051 --> 01:05:28,467
Main Street, Bank robbery.

807
01:05:28,967 --> 01:05:32,801
What rubbish.

808
01:05:33,301 --> 01:05:34,381
Nonsense.

809
01:05:36,926 --> 01:05:41,717
- I know everything, Harman.
- What do you know?

810
01:05:42,217 --> 01:05:43,467
You know nothing.

811
01:05:43,967 --> 01:05:46,728
If you know, why don't you go to the police?
What are you doing here?

812
01:05:46,967 --> 01:05:48,407
I wanted to get a good look at you..

813
01:05:48,634 --> 01:05:51,259
Before I go to the police.

814
01:05:51,759 --> 01:05:53,439
Anyway... Sit.

815
01:05:58,009 --> 01:05:58,986
What do you want?

816
01:05:59,010 --> 01:06:01,884
You need to eat this by hand,
for better taste.

817
01:06:02,384 --> 01:06:03,384
Thank you.

818
01:06:03,759 --> 01:06:06,134
By the way, your husband has
invited me home tomorrow..

819
01:06:06,634 --> 01:06:10,551
- For lunch.
- Oh, that's wonderful.

820
01:06:11,051 --> 01:06:12,509
I forgot the sauce.

821
01:06:13,009 --> 01:06:15,634
I'll be back in a bit. Okay.

822
01:06:16,134 --> 01:06:17,134
Sorry.

823
01:06:19,509 --> 01:06:20,926
She doesn't know anything.

824
01:06:21,426 --> 01:06:26,842
- Please don't involve my wife.
- See you tomorrow.

825
01:06:27,342 --> 01:06:28,422
At lunch.

826
01:06:34,717 --> 01:06:36,384
Where did he go?

827
01:06:36,884 --> 01:06:40,384
He got an urgent phone call.

828
01:06:58,717 --> 01:07:00,509
Hi, Raghu.

829
01:07:01,009 --> 01:07:03,509
Liak will be released tomorrow.

830
01:07:04,009 --> 01:07:06,384
I was thinking about...
meeting you personally..

831
01:07:06,884 --> 01:07:07,884
To say thank you.

832
01:07:08,092 --> 01:07:11,592
When can we meet?

833
01:07:23,092 --> 01:07:24,069
- Hello, Harman.
- Hi.

834
01:07:24,093 --> 01:07:25,412
Please sit.

835
01:07:30,051 --> 01:07:32,009
Lunch was a great idea, thank you.

836
01:07:32,509 --> 01:07:33,759
I am so sorry!

837
01:07:34,259 --> 01:07:35,676
I really am sorry.

838
01:07:36,176 --> 01:07:39,592
Harman told me everything last night.

839
01:07:40,092 --> 01:07:41,634
I don't..

840
01:07:42,134 --> 01:07:45,092
Look, I admit I was involved
in that bank robbery.

841
01:07:45,592 --> 01:07:48,176
But I didn't murder your wife and kid.

842
01:07:48,676 --> 01:07:49,884
I swear.

843
01:07:50,384 --> 01:07:51,926
Liak fired the gun.

844
01:07:52,426 --> 01:07:53,551
I was in the back seat.

845
01:07:54,051 --> 01:07:55,551
I didn't know that gun was loaded.

846
01:07:56,051 --> 01:07:58,551
Liak says the same thing.

847
01:07:59,051 --> 01:08:02,551
I am really sorry.

848
01:08:06,759 --> 01:08:08,759
Nice house.

849
01:08:09,259 --> 01:08:12,759
Misha would've really liked this house.

850
01:08:17,717 --> 01:08:19,259
Misha loved these things.

851
01:08:19,759 --> 01:08:23,176
Everywhere we went,
she collected these things.

852
01:08:23,676 --> 01:08:26,676
But never took them out.

853
01:08:27,176 --> 01:08:32,467
She would say that Robin might
break it, or... Pune's too dusty..

854
01:08:32,967 --> 01:08:35,176
She liked all this.

855
01:08:35,676 --> 01:08:40,217
What do you want from us?

856
01:08:40,717 --> 01:08:42,384
What can you give?

857
01:08:42,884 --> 01:08:43,884
Money.

858
01:08:45,342 --> 01:08:47,092
No.. No..

859
01:08:47,592 --> 01:08:48,759
Oh my God.

860
01:08:49,259 --> 01:08:51,634
Oh my God.

861
01:08:52,134 --> 01:08:53,467
No.. No.. No..

862
01:08:53,967 --> 01:08:54,967
Alright.

863
01:08:55,467 --> 01:08:56,801
You'll give me money?

864
01:08:57,301 --> 01:09:00,801
How much can you give?

865
01:09:09,092 --> 01:09:11,259
10 million. You have 20 seconds.

866
01:09:11,759 --> 01:09:14,134
Give me a better answer,
Or I'm calling the police.

867
01:09:14,634 --> 01:09:15,842
25 million.

868
01:09:16,342 --> 01:09:20,467
- I've Liak's share as well. You can take that too.
- Take everything.

869
01:09:20,967 --> 01:09:23,509
Everything. The hotel, house... everything.

870
01:09:24,009 --> 01:09:28,509
I... know Harman. He can never kill anyone.

871
01:09:29,009 --> 01:09:30,717
I am sorry. I am sorry.

872
01:09:31,217 --> 01:09:34,092
Forgive us, please.

873
01:09:34,592 --> 01:09:38,592
Harman. Kanchan loves you a lot.

874
01:09:39,092 --> 01:09:40,092
Apologize to her.

875
01:09:40,551 --> 01:09:44,676
Say "I am a murderer, Kanchan".

876
01:09:45,176 --> 01:09:49,801
- "Yet you want to save me. Thank you."
- Okay.

877
01:09:50,301 --> 01:09:52,301
Say it!

878
01:09:52,801 --> 01:09:53,801
Say it!

879
01:09:56,342 --> 01:09:58,759
Kanchan, I am a murderer.

880
01:09:59,259 --> 01:10:02,801
Yet you want to save me.

881
01:10:03,301 --> 01:10:04,501
Thank you.

882
01:10:09,134 --> 01:10:11,092
"I forgive you, Harman."

883
01:10:11,592 --> 01:10:12,592
Say it.

884
01:10:15,259 --> 01:10:16,592
I forgive you, Harman.

885
01:10:17,092 --> 01:10:19,384
"But in return." Say it.

886
01:10:19,884 --> 01:10:23,384
But in return... I want
to sleep with Raghu.

887
01:10:32,342 --> 01:10:33,801
Please stop..

888
01:10:34,301 --> 01:10:35,301
I am ready. I am ready.

889
01:10:35,801 --> 01:10:37,301
- I am ready. I am ready.
- Raghu...

890
01:10:37,801 --> 01:10:39,176
- Koko! Go away.
- I am ready.

891
01:10:39,676 --> 01:10:42,332
- Go away Koko. Have you lost your mind?
- Will you leave us alone then?

892
01:10:42,356 --> 01:10:44,259
- What are you saying?
- Just shut up!

893
01:10:44,759 --> 01:10:47,134
Do you want him to go to the police?

894
01:10:47,634 --> 01:10:49,134
Come, the bedroom's upstairs.

895
01:10:49,634 --> 01:10:50,884
Have you lost your mind?

896
01:10:51,384 --> 01:10:52,467
- Come on.
- Koko.

897
01:10:52,967 --> 01:10:55,384
- I'm ready to do anything you want.
- Koko.

898
01:10:55,884 --> 01:10:57,467
Just shut up!

899
01:10:57,967 --> 01:11:03,884
Now you... try and forget this!

900
01:11:04,384 --> 01:11:07,884
No... Koko!!

901
01:11:26,301 --> 01:11:29,801
Take your clothes off.

902
01:11:34,092 --> 01:11:37,592
Right here.

903
01:12:18,801 --> 01:12:20,676
What the hell is wrong with you?

904
01:12:21,176 --> 01:12:24,384
You're ready to sleep with
me to save a murderer?

905
01:12:24,884 --> 01:12:26,426
He killed a child.

906
01:12:26,926 --> 01:12:28,046
- He's a murderer.
- No, no..

907
01:12:28,509 --> 01:12:28,759
- He..
- No.

908
01:12:29,259 --> 01:12:31,967
Harman didn't kill Misha and Robin.

909
01:12:32,467 --> 01:12:35,967
I believe him, please trust me.

910
01:12:40,759 --> 01:12:42,009
Okay.

911
01:12:44,967 --> 01:12:48,467
Let's have some fun.

912
01:13:12,509 --> 01:13:15,884
If you fall down the stairs outside...

913
01:13:16,384 --> 01:13:19,426
- You'll hurt your leg, won't you?
- Yes.

914
01:13:19,926 --> 01:13:21,592
How will you scream?

915
01:13:22,092 --> 01:13:23,134
Scream?

916
01:13:23,634 --> 01:13:24,611
Scream.

917
01:13:24,635 --> 01:13:25,926
Louder.

918
01:13:26,426 --> 01:13:27,426
Louder.

919
01:13:29,467 --> 01:13:30,467
Louder.

920
01:13:38,717 --> 01:13:40,842
- Say my name.
- Raghu.

921
01:13:41,342 --> 01:13:42,467
Raghu. Raghu.

922
01:13:42,967 --> 01:13:44,467
Raghu.

923
01:13:44,967 --> 01:13:46,551
Scream. Scream. Scream.

924
01:13:47,051 --> 01:13:50,551
- Scream.
- Raghu.

925
01:13:53,342 --> 01:13:54,319
Yes, Kanchan!

926
01:13:54,343 --> 01:13:55,509
- Yes, Kanchan!
- Raghu.

927
01:13:55,967 --> 01:13:59,467
Yes, Kanchan!

928
01:14:01,967 --> 01:14:04,801
Liak is being released tomorrow.

929
01:14:05,301 --> 01:14:10,009
What was the agreement between you two?

930
01:14:10,509 --> 01:14:14,134
I have to keep his money
and passport ready.

931
01:14:14,634 --> 01:14:18,134
He said he'll call me once he's out.

932
01:14:22,092 --> 01:14:26,967
When Liak calls, you'll tell me, right?

933
01:14:27,467 --> 01:14:28,467
Yes.

934
01:14:30,009 --> 01:14:32,384
Lunch was good.

935
01:14:32,884 --> 01:14:36,384
I'll be back.

936
01:14:43,759 --> 01:14:46,092
Nothing happened.

937
01:14:46,592 --> 01:14:50,592
Nothing happened, Harman.

938
01:14:51,092 --> 01:14:54,592
He didn't even touch me.

939
01:14:55,092 --> 01:14:56,452
I think he's trying to torture us.

940
01:14:56,676 --> 01:15:00,842
He's completely insane.

941
01:15:01,342 --> 01:15:04,842
Nothing happened.

942
01:15:39,551 --> 01:15:41,051
Greetings, auntie.

943
01:15:41,551 --> 01:15:43,509
Greetings.

944
01:15:44,009 --> 01:15:45,176
- Greetings.
- Hello.

945
01:15:45,676 --> 01:15:47,384
Recognize me?

946
01:15:47,884 --> 01:15:51,009
- Hey, Liak.
- Wilson.

947
01:15:51,509 --> 01:15:55,842
Idiot, you became a priest.

948
01:15:56,342 --> 01:15:59,842
Drop in at the Church.

949
01:16:01,676 --> 01:16:03,384
You were supposed to come tomorrow.

950
01:16:03,884 --> 01:16:06,217
Fine, I'll come tomorrow.

951
01:16:06,717 --> 01:16:10,217
Come on in.

952
01:16:15,967 --> 01:16:19,342
I had prayed to Ajmer Sharif.

953
01:16:19,842 --> 01:16:24,176
Now that you're back, We must go...

954
01:16:24,676 --> 01:16:28,176
Who'll look after the tea shop?

955
01:16:48,842 --> 01:16:53,217
Pakya, get me some soda.

956
01:16:53,717 --> 01:16:54,801
Jhimli who?

957
01:16:55,301 --> 01:16:57,926
She was also called Shabnum.

958
01:16:58,426 --> 01:17:00,009
She worked here 15 years ago.

959
01:17:00,509 --> 01:17:03,509
This isn't Maratha Mandir?

960
01:17:04,009 --> 01:17:06,592
Want me instead?

961
01:17:07,092 --> 01:17:10,592
- Yes...
- No..

962
01:17:14,259 --> 01:17:15,259
You?

963
01:17:18,342 --> 01:17:18,509
When did they release you?

964
01:17:19,009 --> 01:17:20,009
Didn't you hear?

965
01:17:20,426 --> 01:17:21,842
- It was in the newspapers.
- What?

966
01:17:22,342 --> 01:17:24,092
I did some good deeds in jail..

967
01:17:24,592 --> 01:17:26,259
So, they released me early.

968
01:17:26,759 --> 01:17:30,259
Won't you invite me in?

969
01:17:35,259 --> 01:17:39,634
Did you break-out of jail?

970
01:17:40,134 --> 01:17:43,634
Ohhh... my veggies.

971
01:17:48,884 --> 01:17:50,217
Will you eat something?

972
01:17:50,717 --> 01:17:52,384
Nice flat.

973
01:17:52,884 --> 01:17:54,176
This is a classy pad. Wow.

974
01:17:54,676 --> 01:17:55,676
Who gave you the address?

975
01:17:56,009 --> 01:17:58,384
I went to the old haunt.

976
01:17:58,884 --> 01:18:00,009
Why did you go there?

977
01:18:00,509 --> 01:18:02,801
I went looking for you.

978
01:18:03,301 --> 01:18:05,217
How about a drink?

979
01:18:05,717 --> 01:18:08,842
- Do you drink so much?
- No, he gets it.

980
01:18:09,342 --> 01:18:12,676
He can't take it home.

981
01:18:13,176 --> 01:18:15,009
This is Patil sir's home.

982
01:18:15,509 --> 01:18:17,342
Lives in Jalna with his family.

983
01:18:17,842 --> 01:18:21,676
He comes here once a week.

984
01:18:22,176 --> 01:18:27,301
- Is Patil a... politician or gangster?
- He is loaded.

985
01:18:27,801 --> 01:18:31,009
Wants to be a politician.

986
01:18:31,509 --> 01:18:36,426
Jhimli, I needed to borrow
some money, I'll return it.

987
01:18:36,926 --> 01:18:37,903
How much?

988
01:18:37,927 --> 01:18:39,092
Whatever you can lend me.

989
01:18:39,592 --> 01:18:41,217
I'll return it with interest.

990
01:18:41,717 --> 01:18:43,676
Yeah.

991
01:18:44,176 --> 01:18:47,676
You cannot pay my interest.

992
01:19:09,301 --> 01:19:13,259
Tell me something..

993
01:19:13,759 --> 01:19:15,801
How is Patil as a person?

994
01:19:16,301 --> 01:19:17,437
He's fine. Didn't I tell you?

995
01:19:17,461 --> 01:19:18,461
You did?

996
01:19:23,134 --> 01:19:25,426
Does he love you?

997
01:19:25,926 --> 01:19:29,426
What do you care?

998
01:19:34,884 --> 01:19:36,926
Tell me.

999
01:19:37,426 --> 01:19:39,801
Does he love you like I do?

1000
01:19:40,301 --> 01:19:43,801
Do you love him?

1001
01:19:49,467 --> 01:19:50,467
Look...

1002
01:19:52,342 --> 01:19:56,884
once upon a time you and
I made an amazing couple.

1003
01:19:57,384 --> 01:19:59,592
I so looked forward to meeting you...

1004
01:20:00,092 --> 01:20:03,759
spending time with you.

1005
01:20:04,259 --> 01:20:09,217
And you do it all by going to jail.

1006
01:20:09,717 --> 01:20:13,217
Take this money and get lost.

1007
01:20:18,926 --> 01:20:23,217
You're right. Back then we were an item.

1008
01:20:23,717 --> 01:20:27,217
I'll return this money.

1009
01:20:31,551 --> 01:20:34,092
Enjoying?

1010
01:20:34,592 --> 01:20:35,912
I am. I am.

1011
01:20:38,926 --> 01:20:40,551
Will you come back again?

1012
01:20:41,051 --> 01:20:42,551
I will.

1013
01:20:43,051 --> 01:20:44,051
Advance booking.

1014
01:20:44,509 --> 01:20:45,486
Thank you.

1015
01:20:45,510 --> 01:20:49,134
Count the money.

1016
01:20:49,634 --> 01:20:53,134
Come now... get lost.

1017
01:21:02,259 --> 01:21:03,509
I'm going to Pune now.

1018
01:21:04,009 --> 01:21:05,676
You'll follow me.

1019
01:21:06,176 --> 01:21:07,656
Let's go together and share the fare.

1020
01:21:08,051 --> 01:21:09,592
We'll save some money too.

1021
01:21:10,092 --> 01:21:11,092
So?

1022
01:21:13,259 --> 01:21:14,699
Where were you? Where have you been?

1023
01:21:15,092 --> 01:21:18,092
I am not a kid to tell you everything.

1024
01:21:18,592 --> 01:21:20,842
It's very late, get some sleep.

1025
01:21:21,342 --> 01:21:23,134
If only you would let me sleep.

1026
01:21:23,634 --> 01:21:27,134
You're a real pain..

1027
01:21:46,176 --> 01:21:46,634
Hello.

1028
01:21:47,134 --> 01:21:50,634
- Harman's become a gentleman.
- Liak.

1029
01:21:55,592 --> 01:21:57,301
I heard that you own a restaurant now.

1030
01:21:57,801 --> 01:21:58,801
And you even got married.

1031
01:21:59,009 --> 01:22:00,384
Where are you calling from?

1032
01:22:00,884 --> 01:22:02,884
Your number can be tracked.
Whose number is this?

1033
01:22:03,384 --> 01:22:07,592
I didn't utter your name for 15 years.
I won't get you in trouble now.

1034
01:22:08,092 --> 01:22:11,759
Is my passport and money ready?

1035
01:22:12,259 --> 01:22:14,384
How much?

1036
01:22:14,884 --> 01:22:15,884
Say that again.

1037
01:22:16,217 --> 01:22:19,051
- 25 million.
- And passport?

1038
01:22:19,551 --> 01:22:21,467
That's ready too, I just need your photo.

1039
01:22:21,967 --> 01:22:24,842
Where do we meet? Won't you invite me home?

1040
01:22:25,342 --> 01:22:27,509
Introduce me to your wife?

1041
01:22:28,009 --> 01:22:29,092
Is she close-by?

1042
01:22:29,592 --> 01:22:33,092
Give her the phone.

1043
01:22:38,551 --> 01:22:42,092
- Hello.
- Hello, bhabhi I am Liak, Harman's friend.

1044
01:22:42,592 --> 01:22:45,008
I was in South Africa for 15 years.
I just returned to India.

1045
01:22:45,032 --> 01:22:46,842
- How are you?
- I am fine.

1046
01:22:47,342 --> 01:22:49,009
I've heard a lot about you.

1047
01:22:49,509 --> 01:22:53,009
Please come home someday.

1048
01:23:00,634 --> 01:23:04,134
10 o'clock, Bus Depot.

1049
01:23:10,717 --> 01:23:13,801
Call Raghu.

1050
01:23:14,301 --> 01:23:14,717
Let me think.

1051
01:23:15,217 --> 01:23:17,551
There's nothing to think. Call Raghu.

1052
01:23:18,051 --> 01:23:20,691
- You're concerned about Raghu a lot.
- I am concerned about Raghu?

1053
01:23:20,926 --> 01:23:21,926
Yeah.

1054
01:23:22,176 --> 01:23:23,842
Call him.

1055
01:23:24,342 --> 01:23:25,467
I am meeting Liak tomorrow.

1056
01:23:25,967 --> 01:23:26,944
Then I'll call Raghu.

1057
01:23:26,968 --> 01:23:28,634
Stupid!

1058
01:23:29,134 --> 01:23:30,830
- Whatever Liak is doing is for himself.
- Koko.

1059
01:23:30,854 --> 01:23:34,176
- Koko.
- Don't try to save him.

1060
01:23:34,676 --> 01:23:35,756
Damn you!

1061
01:23:38,592 --> 01:23:39,634
Raghu, Kanchan here.

1062
01:23:40,134 --> 01:23:46,009
Liak called. Harman wants to talk to you.

1063
01:23:46,509 --> 01:23:48,551
Talk to him!

1064
01:23:49,051 --> 01:23:49,551
Hello.

1065
01:23:50,051 --> 01:23:53,259
What did he say?

1066
01:23:53,759 --> 01:23:56,717
I am meeting him tomorrow
at 10 at the bus depot.

1067
01:23:57,217 --> 01:23:58,217
You will not meet him.

1068
01:23:58,676 --> 01:24:00,009
I will.

1069
01:24:00,509 --> 01:24:03,884
I'll collect his share of the
money from you. Meanwhile...

1070
01:24:04,384 --> 01:24:11,967
Book two tickets to Shirdi.
Atone for your sins.

1071
01:24:12,467 --> 01:24:13,667
It's okay.

1072
01:24:36,634 --> 01:24:38,467
It's a great deal, Raghu.

1073
01:24:38,967 --> 01:24:41,384
Two years in Europe. It's fantastic.

1074
01:24:41,884 --> 01:24:43,967
And you'll be working with the main agency.

1075
01:24:44,467 --> 01:24:46,203
- You'll get a great exposure.
- Superb exposure.

1076
01:24:46,227 --> 01:24:49,009
Fantastic. I am very happy.

1077
01:24:49,509 --> 01:24:51,259
- You look very happy.
- What?

1078
01:24:51,759 --> 01:24:52,176
What?

1079
01:24:52,676 --> 01:24:53,985
- What are you worried about?
- You?

1080
01:24:54,009 --> 01:24:55,569
How can I live without you for 2 years?

1081
01:24:55,926 --> 01:24:57,485
We can't meet, I can't see you.
How will we..

1082
01:24:57,509 --> 01:24:57,634
Relax.

1083
01:24:58,134 --> 01:24:59,926
It's okay. It's just two years.

1084
01:25:00,426 --> 01:25:01,551
In two years we'll know..

1085
01:25:02,051 --> 01:25:04,227
Whether we're really serious
about each other or not.

1086
01:25:04,251 --> 01:25:08,176
Who knows... you might find
a nice, sexy French girl.

1087
01:25:08,676 --> 01:25:10,717
You know a lot of girls
hit on me and stuff.

1088
01:25:11,217 --> 01:25:13,509
But I want you.. I love you..

1089
01:25:14,009 --> 01:25:16,926
No, I am not letting go. I am..

1090
01:25:17,426 --> 01:25:19,551
Listen...

1091
01:25:20,051 --> 01:25:25,634
- I have news for you.
- What?

1092
01:25:26,134 --> 01:25:27,842
- I am pregnant.
- Come on.

1093
01:25:28,342 --> 01:25:31,842
I am pregnant.

1094
01:25:34,384 --> 01:25:35,824
Why didn't you tell me this earlier?

1095
01:25:36,092 --> 01:25:39,551
- This is the first thing you should have said.
- You didn't ask.

1096
01:25:40,051 --> 01:25:43,217
Why are you worried? We have options.

1097
01:25:43,717 --> 01:25:46,259
No abortion.

1098
01:25:46,759 --> 01:25:48,342
Who's talking about abortion?

1099
01:25:48,842 --> 01:25:51,467
Let's get married.

1100
01:25:51,967 --> 01:25:53,967
- I am 22 and you're 21, Misha.
- So?

1101
01:25:54,467 --> 01:25:57,051
Together we're 43.

1102
01:25:57,551 --> 01:25:59,426
There is a tide in the affairs of men..

1103
01:25:59,926 --> 01:26:03,592
Which taken at the flood,
leads on to fortune.

1104
01:26:04,092 --> 01:26:07,717
Shakespeare.

1105
01:26:08,217 --> 01:26:09,717
Raghu.

1106
01:26:10,217 --> 01:26:12,634
I'll refuse the job
offer, let's have a baby.

1107
01:26:13,134 --> 01:26:14,111
Are... you..

1108
01:26:14,135 --> 01:26:15,717
- Let's have a baby.
- Really..

1109
01:26:16,217 --> 01:26:17,217
I want a baby now.

1110
01:26:17,551 --> 01:26:19,007
- We're going to have a baby.
- No, no.

1111
01:26:19,031 --> 01:26:20,318
- We're going to have a baby.
- Please.

1112
01:26:20,342 --> 01:26:21,622
I am going to have a baby, guys.

1113
01:26:21,816 --> 01:26:25,316
- I have done it.
- Stop.

1114
01:26:35,527 --> 01:26:39,485
I am in Pune.

1115
01:26:40,134 --> 01:26:43,676
Can we meet tomorrow for lunch?

1116
01:26:44,176 --> 01:26:45,176
Superb.

But I won't.

1133
01:27:58,759 --> 01:28:02,259
I understand.

1134
01:28:06,259 --> 01:28:09,092
You gave us a second chance.

1135
01:28:09,592 --> 01:28:10,592
Thank you.

1136
01:28:10,842 --> 01:28:12,842
Please sit. Would you like something?
Tea, coffee?

1137
01:28:13,342 --> 01:28:14,759
Harman will be back by 2 o'clock.

1138
01:28:15,259 --> 01:28:17,884
So... we've very little time. Lets go!

1139
01:28:18,384 --> 01:28:19,384
Where?

1140
01:28:19,634 --> 01:28:20,634
The bedroom.

1141
01:28:21,051 --> 01:28:24,551
Keep the wine in the fridge.

1142
01:28:48,509 --> 01:28:52,509
Go take a shower, and wear this.

1143
01:28:53,009 --> 01:28:54,009
Go.

1144
01:29:13,342 --> 01:29:15,426
Hello, Harman. Where are you?

1145
01:29:15,926 --> 01:29:18,801
He's here.

1146
01:29:19,301 --> 01:29:21,967
No, he's having tea. Everything's fine.

1147
01:29:22,467 --> 01:29:24,842
No, I'll handle it. I am fine.

1148
01:29:25,342 --> 01:29:26,542
Okay. Bye.

1149
01:30:50,967 --> 01:30:52,509
Kanchan.

1150
01:30:53,009 --> 01:30:56,176
- Where's Kanchan?
- Upstairs.

1151
01:30:56,676 --> 01:30:57,676
Money?

1152
01:31:02,467 --> 01:31:08,801
Passport... and money. Here you go.

1153
01:31:09,301 --> 01:31:11,384
Kanchan.

1154
01:31:11,884 --> 01:31:15,426
Where are you?

1155
01:31:15,926 --> 01:31:17,009
Koko.

1156
01:31:17,509 --> 01:31:17,926
Koko.

1157
01:31:18,426 --> 01:31:20,509
Koko. Koko.

1158
01:31:21,009 --> 01:31:22,676
Koko. Koko.

1159
01:31:23,176 --> 01:31:25,717
Koko. Koko.

1160
01:31:26,217 --> 01:31:27,676
She's alive. She's alive.

1161
01:31:28,176 --> 01:31:29,176
Oh God!

1162
01:31:32,467 --> 01:31:34,967
I'll call the ambulance. Ambulance.

1163
01:31:35,467 --> 01:31:36,676
The ambulance did come.

1164
01:31:37,176 --> 01:31:38,426
They even took her to the ICU.

1165
01:31:38,926 --> 01:31:42,717
The doctors did everything.

1166
01:31:43,217 --> 01:31:47,759
But she still died.

1167
01:31:48,259 --> 01:31:52,426
- Koko. Koko.
- Harman.

1168
01:31:52,926 --> 01:31:54,592
Koko.

1169
01:31:55,092 --> 01:31:55,509
Harman.

1170
01:31:56,009 --> 01:31:58,092
Koko. Koko.

1171
01:31:58,592 --> 01:32:04,967
Her eyes were open,
but she couldn't see me.

1172
01:32:05,467 --> 01:32:08,967
And she died.

1173
01:33:09,092 --> 01:33:10,509
- Hi.
- Hi, Shobha.

1174
01:33:11,009 --> 01:33:14,884
You're late, but I forgive you. Come.

1175
01:33:15,384 --> 01:33:16,634
Come.

1176
01:33:20,759 --> 01:33:23,092
- So she's Natasha.
- Yes.

1177
01:33:23,592 --> 01:33:27,092
She studies in a hostel.
Just went back yesterday.

1178
01:33:30,509 --> 01:33:33,217
And husband?

1179
01:33:33,717 --> 01:33:34,797
Divorced.

1180
01:33:42,967 --> 01:33:45,634
I talked to Liak, he was happy.

1181
01:33:46,134 --> 01:33:47,384
He's getting good treatment.

1182
01:33:47,884 --> 01:33:50,842
- All because of you.
- Because of you.

1183
01:33:51,342 --> 01:33:53,592
Not just Liak, you saved me as well.

1184
01:33:54,092 --> 01:33:56,926
For the first time in 15
years, I am out on a date.

1185
01:33:57,426 --> 01:34:00,926
And I am... happy.

1186
01:34:01,426 --> 01:34:02,426
Thank you.

1187
01:34:02,634 --> 01:34:06,134
I am happy too.

1188
01:34:12,092 --> 01:34:14,176
Do you always play these kiddie games..

1189
01:34:14,676 --> 01:34:16,884
Or, are you interested
in something else too?

1190
01:34:17,384 --> 01:34:21,676
My daughter plays this. So we always
learn two new words every day.

1191
01:34:22,176 --> 01:34:25,426
That's why we play this.

1192
01:34:25,926 --> 01:34:29,426
Would you like to play with me?

1193
01:34:32,384 --> 01:34:34,509
- What's that?
- What?

1194
01:34:35,009 --> 01:34:38,801
- This?
- What?

1195
01:34:39,301 --> 01:34:40,501
New shirt.

1196
01:34:50,634 --> 01:34:54,134
Shall I draw the curtains
or we move to the bedroom?

Hello.

1236
01:38:10,801 --> 01:38:13,051
Kind attention..

1237
01:38:13,551 --> 01:38:17,051
If any undeclared or suspicious
object found under the seat..

1238
01:38:33,759 --> 01:38:37,259
Hello, Liak.

1239
01:38:38,676 --> 01:38:40,134
What are you doing?

1240
01:38:40,634 --> 01:38:43,884
Just wanted to know how you're doing.

1241
01:38:44,384 --> 01:38:45,592
How are you?

1242
01:38:46,092 --> 01:38:47,342
Okay.

1243
01:38:51,926 --> 01:38:55,426
Are you waiting for someone?

1244
01:38:57,926 --> 01:38:58,926
No.

1245
01:39:03,926 --> 01:39:07,426
- Your friend's not coming.
- What friend?

1246
01:39:37,759 --> 01:39:39,134
Where's Harman?

1247
01:39:39,634 --> 01:39:42,134
He's gone to Shirdi with the missus.

1248
01:39:42,634 --> 01:39:42,967
Shirdi?

1249
01:39:43,467 --> 01:39:44,467
Yes.

1250
01:39:44,926 --> 01:39:47,759
Liak's been visiting Konkan Queen
Restaurant for the past few days.

1251
01:39:48,259 --> 01:39:51,384
Yesterday he went there twice.

1252
01:39:51,884 --> 01:39:53,676
Is the food good?

1253
01:39:54,176 --> 01:39:59,092
It's spicy... Tasty!

1254
01:39:59,592 --> 01:40:01,717
You're bound to get a promotion.
Send Kadam.

1255
01:40:02,217 --> 01:40:03,697
Sir, they've been missing for 5 days.

1256
01:40:04,134 --> 01:40:05,318
Their mobiles are switched off too.

1257
01:40:05,342 --> 01:40:07,592
They booked a room at the
Sun N Sand hotel, Shirdi.

1258
01:40:08,092 --> 01:40:09,132
But they never checked in.

1259
01:40:09,342 --> 01:40:12,842
The car's missing, and
the house locked too.

1260
01:40:16,759 --> 01:40:19,259
Why do you visit Konkan Queen so often?

1261
01:40:19,759 --> 01:40:22,009
Their prawns are really good.

1262
01:40:22,509 --> 01:40:25,509
You travel 12 kilometers
for their sea-food.

1263
01:40:26,009 --> 01:40:29,509
You're quite the food buff.

1264
01:40:33,217 --> 01:40:36,717
Why did you evade my man
at the cinema hall that day?

1265
01:40:42,967 --> 01:40:45,634
Did you come here?

1266
01:40:46,134 --> 01:40:49,926
I went to get some weed. I am ill.

1267
01:40:50,426 --> 01:40:54,551
Your people follow me around,
no one sells me the stuff.

1268
01:40:55,051 --> 01:40:59,051
What happened here?

1269
01:40:59,551 --> 01:41:02,842
What do you think?

1270
01:41:03,342 --> 01:41:05,634
I feel..

1271
01:41:06,134 --> 01:41:07,134
Hold on.

1272
01:41:11,051 --> 01:41:12,301
Stop.

1273
01:41:14,342 --> 01:41:17,676
What's he doing here?

1274
01:41:18,176 --> 01:41:19,801
I gave Mrs Harman a lift once.

1275
01:41:20,301 --> 01:41:24,384
And she invited me to the restaurant.

1276
01:41:24,884 --> 01:41:26,509
Good homely food.

1277
01:41:27,009 --> 01:41:30,051
Liak was praising the food as well.

1278
01:41:30,551 --> 01:41:31,967
What do you want to say?

1279
01:41:32,467 --> 01:41:36,217
15 years ago, Harman
worked in a small garage.

1280
01:41:36,717 --> 01:41:39,259
Salary, only 2000.

1281
01:41:39,759 --> 01:41:41,119
But suddenly he hit some jackpot..

1282
01:41:41,384 --> 01:41:43,926
And now owns a posh restaurant.

1283
01:41:44,426 --> 01:41:48,134
So you mean... Harman is Liak's partner.

1284
01:41:48,634 --> 01:41:52,134
Congratulations, sir.
Finally you found him.

1285
01:41:56,551 --> 01:42:00,051
Found him? Not really.

1286
01:42:02,301 --> 01:42:06,134
The couple's been missing since the 5th.

1287
01:42:06,634 --> 01:42:07,634
So?

1288
01:42:09,009 --> 01:42:11,217
You were in Pune on the 5th, right?

1289
01:42:11,717 --> 01:42:13,051
Yes.

1290
01:42:13,551 --> 01:42:17,842
Where were you?

1291
01:42:18,342 --> 01:42:19,926
I was on a lunch date.

1292
01:42:20,426 --> 01:42:22,176
With Shobha.

1293
01:42:22,676 --> 01:42:25,384
At her home.

1294
01:42:25,884 --> 01:42:27,467
How long?

1295
01:42:27,967 --> 01:42:29,217
8 pm.

1296
01:42:30,842 --> 01:42:32,092
8 pm.

1297
01:42:36,926 --> 01:42:39,926
8 pm is my dinner time.

1298
01:42:40,426 --> 01:42:42,134
See you.

1299
01:42:42,634 --> 01:42:43,714
Bye, sir.

1300
01:42:49,926 --> 01:42:54,551
Did you tell anyone about Harman?

1301
01:42:55,051 --> 01:42:59,717
I never told anyone.

1302
01:43:00,217 --> 01:43:04,426
Be honest, and I won't harm you.

1303
01:43:04,926 --> 01:43:08,426
I said I didn't tell anyone...

1304
01:43:11,426 --> 01:43:12,634
Yes, I did.

1305
01:43:13,134 --> 01:43:15,134
I told Raghav.

1306
01:43:15,634 --> 01:43:17,842
And that's the reason you're out here.

1307
01:43:18,342 --> 01:43:20,592
You didn't do a thing for last 14 years.

1308
01:43:21,092 --> 01:43:24,592
And now you're threatening your mother.

1309
01:43:34,842 --> 01:43:37,967
What did you tell the inspector?
We had sex?

1310
01:43:38,467 --> 01:43:42,092
All I said that when I
left you were asleep.

1311
01:43:42,592 --> 01:43:43,634
What for?

1312
01:43:44,134 --> 01:43:46,551
You know he asked me such absurd questions.

1313
01:43:47,051 --> 01:43:49,652
- No one ever dared to speak to me like that..
- This is a police investigation.

1314
01:43:49,676 --> 01:43:52,592
I will have to answer all their questions.

1315
01:43:53,092 --> 01:43:56,051
I don't believe this.

1316
01:43:56,551 --> 01:44:00,009
I thought there was something between us.

1317
01:44:00,509 --> 01:44:04,051
- I really liked you.
- Maybe I didn't like you.

1318
01:44:04,551 --> 01:44:07,051
You sympathize with the
criminals in jail, don't you?

1319
01:44:07,551 --> 01:44:15,134
But what about the people
whose lives they ruined?

1320
01:44:15,634 --> 01:44:17,509
You used me, right?

1321
01:44:18,009 --> 01:44:20,217
Maybe the inspector's right.

1322
01:44:20,717 --> 01:44:22,176
You are involved in some murder.

1323
01:44:22,676 --> 01:44:24,009
He might arrest me.

1324
01:44:24,509 --> 01:44:25,926
Put me in jail.

1325
01:44:26,426 --> 01:44:28,676
Then you'll come visit me. Hold my hands.

1326
01:44:29,176 --> 01:44:31,092
Relieve my pain.

1327
01:44:31,592 --> 01:44:34,467
Sympathize with me.

1328
01:44:34,967 --> 01:44:36,847
And we can even have sex
in the doctor's cabin.

1329
01:44:37,134 --> 01:44:38,334
How dare..

1330
01:45:20,842 --> 01:45:26,217
Where's the money? Where's the money?

1331
01:45:26,717 --> 01:45:30,217
Where's my money?

1332
01:47:15,176 --> 01:47:17,926
Where's my money?

1333
01:47:18,426 --> 01:47:19,626
My friend?

1334
01:47:23,759 --> 01:47:27,426
I killed Harman and his wife.

1335
01:47:27,926 --> 01:47:30,676
You killed?

1336
01:47:31,176 --> 01:47:32,592
How did you kill them?

1337
01:47:33,092 --> 01:47:34,884
With a hammer.

1338
01:47:35,384 --> 01:47:40,051
In their own bedroom.

1339
01:47:40,551 --> 01:47:44,051
Do you want to know how?
How I did it? Do you want to hear?

1340
01:47:48,717 --> 01:47:51,259
First I covered the room with plastic.

1341
01:47:51,759 --> 01:47:54,134
When his wife stepped out after a shower..

1342
01:47:54,634 --> 01:47:56,217
I severed a blow to her head.

1343
01:47:56,717 --> 01:47:58,926
She fell unconscious.

1344
01:47:59,426 --> 01:48:04,134
Next, when Harman returned
with the money, I killed him too.

1345
01:48:04,634 --> 01:48:09,259
You really killed them?

1346
01:48:09,759 --> 01:48:14,384
Your friend, whose name
you didn't utter for 15 years..

1347
01:48:14,884 --> 01:48:19,634
Was ready to give me
your share of the money.

1348
01:48:20,134 --> 01:48:27,926
And his wife was ready to
sleep with me... to save him.

1349
01:48:28,426 --> 01:48:32,009
Are you telling the truth?

1350
01:48:32,509 --> 01:48:36,092
I buried them in Khadakvasla sector 3.

1351
01:48:36,592 --> 01:48:40,092
And you will never find that money.

1352
01:48:45,259 --> 01:48:48,676
- And now you're going to kill me too.
- You're already dead.

1353
01:48:49,176 --> 01:48:52,676
You're just going to rot
for few more months.

1354
01:49:27,134 --> 01:49:30,634
Harman didn't kill your wife, I did.

1355
01:49:35,926 --> 01:49:38,801
I was confused. I went crazy for a moment.

1356
01:49:39,301 --> 01:49:41,141
Your kid fell out and
your wife was screaming.

1357
01:49:41,634 --> 01:49:45,134
Suddenly I pulled out the gun and shot her.

1358
01:49:45,634 --> 01:49:49,134
I had blown a fuse.

1359
01:49:52,134 --> 01:49:54,259
But you had a cool mind.

1360
01:49:54,759 --> 01:49:57,926
You murdered two people... with a hammer.

1361
01:49:58,426 --> 01:50:01,092
Innocent people.

1362
01:50:01,592 --> 01:50:06,259
What is the difference..
Between you and me.

1363
01:50:06,759 --> 01:50:08,926
You've gone crazy.

1364
01:50:09,426 --> 01:50:12,926
Get yourself treated.

1365
01:50:49,217 --> 01:50:50,426
What happened to you?

1366
01:50:50,926 --> 01:50:54,842
What happened?

1367
01:50:55,342 --> 01:50:56,342
Show me.

1368
01:50:56,717 --> 01:50:58,592
Your face is completely swollen.

1369
01:50:59,092 --> 01:51:01,259
You're back to your old ways, right?

1370
01:51:01,759 --> 01:51:03,551
What are you looking at?

1371
01:51:04,051 --> 01:51:06,259
Jhimli.

1372
01:51:06,759 --> 01:51:09,717
I am going to die.

1373
01:51:10,217 --> 01:51:11,217
Huh?

1374
01:51:14,592 --> 01:51:17,717
That's why I was released from jail.
I've got cancer.

1375
01:51:18,217 --> 01:51:21,717
I've just one year to live.

1376
01:51:24,801 --> 01:51:25,259
Yes.

1377
01:51:25,759 --> 01:51:28,717
I was scared to know.

1378
01:51:29,217 --> 01:51:31,301
When I was released, I
thought I'll get my share..

1379
01:51:31,801 --> 01:51:36,551
Because I didn't utter my
partner's name for 15 years.

1380
01:51:37,051 --> 01:51:44,217
And we'll travel, have fun for
10 months with that money.

1381
01:51:44,717 --> 01:51:47,342
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

1382
01:51:47,842 --> 01:51:49,092
I wanted to surprise you.

1383
01:51:49,592 --> 01:51:50,792
<i>♪ Jhimli.. ♪</i>

1384
01:51:55,801 --> 01:51:57,509
Okay, madam... I'll change this.

1385
01:51:58,009 --> 01:52:01,842
- Chicken noodles, right?
- Hey... stop.

1386
01:52:02,342 --> 01:52:03,551
Who are you?

1387
01:52:04,051 --> 01:52:08,592
Sameer. From Uncle's Kitchen.

1388
01:52:09,092 --> 01:52:10,092
Sameer.

1389
01:52:13,801 --> 01:52:15,092
How's Tony?

1390
01:52:15,592 --> 01:52:18,134
- He's fine, okay.
- Okay?

1391
01:52:18,634 --> 01:52:20,154
- Give him my regards, alright?
- Okay.

1392
01:52:20,467 --> 01:52:23,176
- Tell him I was missing him.
- Fine.

1393
01:52:23,676 --> 01:52:26,717
Tony died a month ago.

1394
01:52:27,217 --> 01:52:29,592
Who is he?

1395
01:52:30,092 --> 01:52:31,801
- You misunderstand, sir..
- Shut up.

1396
01:52:32,301 --> 01:52:35,842
He's a friend, we're
meeting after a long time.

1397
01:52:36,342 --> 01:52:38,634
Your friend calls himself a delivery boy..

1398
01:52:39,134 --> 01:52:41,759
And walks out with the
parcel, and you just watch.

1399
01:52:42,259 --> 01:52:44,967
You think I am a fool.

1400
01:52:45,467 --> 01:52:47,342
What are you staring at?

1401
01:52:47,842 --> 01:52:50,342
Are you back to whoring again?

1402
01:52:50,842 --> 01:52:52,426
- Why you..
- Liak! Liak!

1403
01:52:52,926 --> 01:52:53,926
Stop it.

1404
01:52:54,342 --> 01:52:55,342
Keep it down.

1405
01:52:55,842 --> 01:52:57,509
Liak, let go. Liak! Get lost.

1406
01:52:58,009 --> 01:53:00,801
Get out. Go.

1407
01:53:01,301 --> 01:53:03,217
Hey... Go inside!

1408
01:53:03,717 --> 01:53:04,917
Go inside!

1409
01:53:18,051 --> 01:53:19,301
Hey..

1410
01:53:21,467 --> 01:53:24,259
Wait. Wait.

1411
01:53:24,759 --> 01:53:26,217
Are you okay?

1412
01:53:26,717 --> 01:53:28,384
I told him about your cancer.

1413
01:53:28,884 --> 01:53:30,134
Here.

1414
01:53:32,551 --> 01:53:33,551
I don't want it. Keep it.

1415
01:53:34,009 --> 01:53:35,592
Keep it, it's for your treatment.

1416
01:53:36,092 --> 01:53:37,693
I'm getting free treatment
from the government.

1417
01:53:37,717 --> 01:53:38,717
Don't worry. Keep it.

1418
01:53:39,134 --> 01:53:41,009
I'm sure you have other expenses.

1419
01:53:41,509 --> 01:53:45,467
Yeah, I do... if you come along.

1420
01:53:45,967 --> 01:53:47,592
Will you?

1421
01:53:48,092 --> 01:53:50,842
I... can't come now.

1422
01:53:51,342 --> 01:53:53,467
He'll be here till Monday.

1423
01:53:53,967 --> 01:53:57,467
After that I...

1424
01:54:03,259 --> 01:54:06,884
Say something dirty.

1425
01:54:07,384 --> 01:54:09,176
What was it?

1426
01:54:09,676 --> 01:54:10,676
If..

1427
01:54:11,051 --> 01:54:14,551
If you bite I'll slap you tight.

1428
01:54:39,092 --> 01:54:43,176
Keep the money.

1429
01:54:43,676 --> 01:54:46,009
I was supposed to get 25 million.

1430
01:54:46,509 --> 01:54:49,509
But Raghu killed my partner and his wife.

1431
01:54:50,009 --> 01:54:51,209
Now watch what I do to him...

1432
01:54:51,467 --> 01:54:55,842
Don't do anything. Wait..

1433
01:54:56,342 --> 01:54:58,509
I committed a murder.

1434
01:54:59,009 --> 01:55:00,842
I am a convicted killer.

1435
01:55:01,342 --> 01:55:04,842
If you ever hit her again,
I will kill you. Goodnight.

1436
01:55:37,759 --> 01:55:40,092
Where are you going?

1437
01:55:40,592 --> 01:55:42,051
Cleaning my house.

1438
01:55:42,551 --> 01:55:44,967
What brings you here?

1439
01:55:45,467 --> 01:55:48,967
I'd like a cup of tea.

1440
01:55:53,509 --> 01:55:57,842
You didn't tell me that you
went to Harman's home too.

1441
01:55:58,342 --> 01:56:00,509
Fingerprints. Perfect match.

1442
01:56:01,009 --> 01:56:02,717
They invited me for lunch.

1443
01:56:03,217 --> 01:56:06,717
You get a lot of invitations for lunch.

1444
01:56:13,051 --> 01:56:15,384
- Where's the money?
- What money?

1445
01:56:15,884 --> 01:56:17,884
Don't play that game with me.

1446
01:56:18,384 --> 01:56:20,759
Liak's share of money.

1447
01:56:21,259 --> 01:56:23,842
From the bank robbery.

1448
01:56:24,342 --> 01:56:27,301
You're clearly visible in the
CC camera at Aundh signal.

1449
01:56:27,801 --> 01:56:29,759
In Harman's car.

1450
01:56:30,259 --> 01:56:33,759
You murdered Harman and his wife.

1451
01:56:42,217 --> 01:56:44,342
What will you prove in the court?

1452
01:56:44,842 --> 01:56:47,301
That I, whose wife and kid were killed..

1453
01:56:47,801 --> 01:56:52,051
First pardoned Liak, and
then murdered his partner.

1454
01:56:52,551 --> 01:56:55,217
For money?

1455
01:56:55,717 --> 01:56:56,717
Sugar?

1456
01:57:00,759 --> 01:57:02,426
You might escape death sentence.

1457
01:57:02,926 --> 01:57:06,801
But jail term is guaranteed.

1458
01:57:07,301 --> 01:57:09,967
Give me the money...

1459
01:57:10,467 --> 01:57:13,009
I'll erase all evidence.

1460
01:57:13,509 --> 01:57:15,134
Or else..

1461
01:57:15,634 --> 01:57:19,134
Looking for your retirement fund.

1462
01:57:23,467 --> 01:57:26,759
Call it what you may.

1463
01:57:27,259 --> 01:57:29,509
I'm retiring on Monday.

1464
01:57:30,009 --> 01:57:33,509
You have until Monday, 11 o'clock.

1465
01:58:13,176 --> 01:58:16,801
These days I've no clue
about your whereabouts.

1466
01:58:17,301 --> 01:58:21,759
You're just like your father.

1467
01:58:22,259 --> 01:58:25,759
Go have your dinner,

1468
01:58:37,551 --> 01:58:43,426
You always curse my father.

1469
01:58:43,926 --> 01:58:47,509
There must be something good about him.

1470
01:58:48,009 --> 01:58:49,009
Tell me.

1471
01:58:52,884 --> 01:58:53,884
What do I say?

1472
01:58:54,384 --> 01:58:58,009
There must be something good about him.

1473
01:58:58,509 --> 01:59:02,467
Why are you trying to stir up the past.

1474
01:59:02,967 --> 01:59:05,426
Forget it.

1475
01:59:05,926 --> 01:59:07,126
Forget it.

1476
01:59:20,342 --> 01:59:23,384
I specifically said a
bouquet worth 500 rupees...

1477
01:59:23,884 --> 01:59:25,592
What's going on? What's all this?

1478
01:59:26,092 --> 01:59:28,926
Sir, it's your send-off today.

1479
01:59:29,426 --> 01:59:31,051
Good.

1480
01:59:31,551 --> 01:59:33,342
Is it done?

1481
01:59:33,842 --> 01:59:36,676
Liak, listen.

1482
01:59:37,176 --> 01:59:39,092
Go back to your stall. Stop following me.

1483
01:59:39,592 --> 01:59:42,259
- Get back to the stall.
- Listen.

1484
01:59:42,759 --> 01:59:44,009
Liak.

1485
01:59:49,676 --> 01:59:52,967
If anyone asks if there's
something good about your son..

1486
01:59:53,467 --> 01:59:55,551
So you will tell them, won't you?

1487
01:59:56,051 --> 01:59:57,251
Please do.

1488
01:59:59,842 --> 02:00:01,884
Yes, sir.

1489
02:00:02,384 --> 02:00:04,551
My last day at work today.

1490
02:00:05,051 --> 02:00:07,176
- What have you decided?
- You won't get the money.

1491
02:00:07,676 --> 02:00:08,985
Congratulations for your retirement.

1492
02:00:09,009 --> 02:00:10,259
Don't be smart.

1493
02:00:10,759 --> 02:00:15,509
- I am coming there.
- Do what you want.

1494
02:00:16,009 --> 02:00:16,986
Where's my driver?

1495
02:00:17,010 --> 02:00:19,426
Sir, he's gone home to fetch your family.

1496
02:00:19,926 --> 02:00:22,009
- Come on, get the car.
- Sir, please don't go.

1497
02:00:22,509 --> 02:00:26,009
It's a small program. I'll be back soon.

1498
02:00:29,342 --> 02:00:33,467
I killed Harman and his wife.

1499
02:00:33,967 --> 02:00:34,967
What?

1500
02:00:35,384 --> 02:00:36,884
I killed those two.

1501
02:00:37,384 --> 02:00:41,426
I barged in their bedroom.

1502
02:00:41,926 --> 02:00:43,926
Covered the floor with plastic..

1503
02:00:44,426 --> 02:00:47,051
And hammered them to death.
They're both dead.

1504
02:00:47,551 --> 02:00:50,759
He said he won't give me my share.

1505
02:00:51,259 --> 02:00:52,967
He refused to recognize me.

1506
02:00:53,467 --> 02:00:59,092
The bodies are at Khadakvasla sector 3.

1507
02:00:59,592 --> 02:01:01,092
I know you didn't commit the murders.

1508
02:01:01,592 --> 02:01:04,842
What's your game?

1509
02:01:05,342 --> 02:01:06,342
Tell me.

1510
02:01:08,759 --> 02:01:12,259
Say you didn't kill them.

1511
02:01:14,884 --> 02:01:18,384
Say you didn't kill them.

1512
02:01:20,634 --> 02:01:23,842
Say you didn't kill them!

1513
02:01:24,342 --> 02:01:26,342
You didn't kill them!

1514
02:01:26,842 --> 02:01:29,509
Say you didn't kill them! Say it!

1515
02:01:30,009 --> 02:01:31,509
Say you didn't kill them!

1516
02:01:32,009 --> 02:01:35,009
You didn't kill them!

1517
02:01:35,509 --> 02:01:38,134
Say you didn't kill them!

1518
02:01:38,634 --> 02:01:39,634
Please move back.

1519
02:01:39,926 --> 02:01:41,717
Please move back.

1520
02:01:42,217 --> 02:01:44,467
Sir, you finally solved
a 15 year old case...

1521
02:01:44,967 --> 02:01:47,487
On the day of your retirement.
How do you feel? Please tell us.

1522
02:01:47,967 --> 02:01:48,051
Feeling good.

1523
02:01:48,551 --> 02:01:50,527
It's a historic day for you, sir.
How do you feel?

1524
02:01:50,551 --> 02:01:51,592
Was Liak taken to jail?

1525
02:01:51,842 --> 02:01:54,051
How will you recover the stolen money?

1526
02:01:54,551 --> 02:01:57,509
By selling Konkan Queen, or
do you have another option?

1527
02:01:58,009 --> 02:02:00,051
How long will he be sentenced to now?

1528
02:02:00,551 --> 02:02:01,551
Please sir... please.

1529
02:02:02,009 --> 02:02:04,634
Please tell us... please..

1530
02:02:05,134 --> 02:02:06,384
Sir..

1531
02:02:16,509 --> 02:02:20,009
Pick that up, take it.

1532
02:02:28,051 --> 02:02:29,634
Pawan, I asked you to get cigarettes.

1533
02:02:30,134 --> 02:02:33,634
- I've got it.
- Did you?

1534
02:02:41,217 --> 02:02:44,717
I had a great time in Bangkok.

1535
02:02:47,717 --> 02:02:51,217
He committed two murders.

1536
02:03:06,259 --> 02:03:07,676
You didn't go today either.

1537
02:03:08,176 --> 02:03:11,009
I've told you many times. Chemo
will help you relieve the pain.

1538
02:03:11,509 --> 02:03:12,759
And what happened last night?

1539
02:03:13,259 --> 02:03:14,592
You fainted again, didn't you?

1540
02:03:15,092 --> 02:03:19,259
No, it was just.. I pretend to be in pain.

1541
02:03:19,759 --> 02:03:23,467
So they give me some weed.

1542
02:03:23,967 --> 02:03:25,247
Why are you working on a Sunday?

1543
02:03:25,634 --> 02:03:27,301
Nobody else is.

1544
02:03:27,801 --> 02:03:30,634
I make one chair in four days.

1545
02:03:31,134 --> 02:03:38,134
And outside it sells for... 3000 rupees.

1546
02:03:38,634 --> 02:03:43,509
You're good at it, keep this one for me.

1547
02:03:44,009 --> 02:03:47,509
Will you get me a discount?

1548
02:04:18,259 --> 02:04:20,134
Your wife and kid's killer is dead.

1549
02:04:20,634 --> 02:04:22,426
I know.

1550
02:04:22,926 --> 02:04:26,467
So you must know... why he turned
himself over to the police?

1551
02:04:26,967 --> 02:04:31,384
Took the blame for your crimes.

1552
02:04:31,884 --> 02:04:35,509
To give you a second chance.

1553
02:04:36,009 --> 02:04:37,489
Everyone doesn't get a second chance.

1554
02:04:37,884 --> 02:04:40,176
Liak didn't get it, I didn't.

1555
02:04:40,676 --> 02:04:42,301
But you did.

1556
02:04:42,801 --> 02:04:46,301
Don't waste it.

1557
02:04:49,676 --> 02:04:52,592
And anyway...

1558
02:04:53,092 --> 02:04:55,384
you got your revenge.

1559
02:04:55,884 --> 02:04:56,884
