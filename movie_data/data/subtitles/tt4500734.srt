1
00:01:34,638 --> 00:01:37,539
These statues are made
from some kind of sand.

2
00:01:37,975 --> 00:01:39,500
If we try to move them.

3
00:01:39,743 --> 00:01:41,507
"They will turn into million pieces.

4
00:01:42,146 --> 00:01:43,614
The statue made from Bhairo..

5
00:01:43,681 --> 00:01:45,115
...we're looking for
that panicular one..

6
00:01:45,182 --> 00:01:47,276
"Which is wonh millions of dollars.

7
00:01:47,551 --> 00:01:49,485
It's over 300 years old.

8
00:01:49,553 --> 00:01:51,749
Mr. Samar, if you can

What are these Englishmen saying?

14

They're saying the same thing, Vikram.

15
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:12,541
They want the same unique
statue made by Bhairo.

16
00:02:12,977 --> 00:02:14,274
I've been trying to tell you.

17
00:02:14,345 --> 00:02:15,403
Stop being so stubborn.

18
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:17,641
You won't find that statue now.
- Brother Samar!

19
00:02:18,449 --> 00:02:20,611
No need to enlighten me.

20
00:02:21,552 --> 00:02:24,647
Big jobs require more time.

21
00:02:25,322 --> 00:02:30,351
That statue will be found,
and I will find it.

22
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:43,573
"Crazy.."

23
00:02:43,641 --> 00:02:45,541

Where are you going? - This way.

00:02:49,313 --> 00:02:56,219
"What's this restlessness?"

27
00:02:57,187 --> 00:02:59,519
"Maybe..l'm about to lose my heart."

28
00:03:00,124 --> 00:03:02,183

00:03:55,779 --> 00:03:59,716
"My eyes wonder..where's my destiny."

42
00:03:59,783 --> 00:04:03,378

"Your crazy lover..calls out to you."

50
00:04:50,467 --> 00:04:59,205
"It's your wish..whether
you come or not."

51
00:06:24,294 --> 00:06:26,388
"Fair boys."

52
00:06:42,179 --> 00:06:43,874
Good evening, Ladies and Gentlemen!

She's so hot!

81
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:19,505
I never thought you'll
be able to get Meera for my show.

82
00:08:19,576 --> 00:08:23,479
Nothing is impossible
for the king of fashion.

83
00:08:24,548 --> 00:08:28,781
"My beautiful face..glitters
like the moon."

84

My rustic look.."

91
00:08:53,577 --> 00:08:59,380
"My rustic look..floored

92
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:07,614

103
00:09:28,445 --> 00:09:30,243
Yes. He's cancelled
that and given it to us.

104
00:09:30,313 --> 00:09:31,576
Amazing. - I know.

105

Yeah right. - Where is she?

109
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,488
She must be in her makeup room.

110
00:09:53,136 --> 00:09:53,830
This way.

111
00:09:54,705 --> 00:09:57,572
Meera, lwould like

00:10:02,913 --> 00:10:04,642
Andi showed me your
pictures on his phone.

115
00:10:04,815 --> 00:10:05,907
What a memory.

116
00:10:06,917 --> 00:10:08,282
And what a figure.

117
00:10:08,852 --> 00:10:10,843
You're looking really
hot in that shon skin, Meera?

118
00:10:12,122 --> 00:10:12,884
You know, babes.

119
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:18,193
In the glamour industry,
the shoncut to success.

120
00:10:20,397 --> 00:10:22,559
Is shon skin! - Oh.

121

I think you know very
well to the fashion industry.

122
00:10:25,535 --> 00:10:27,526
Why don't you clearly
say that I am a b***

123
00:10:27,804 --> 00:10:31,934
Oh..supermodel from
Milan and such attitude.

124
00:10:32,242 --> 00:10:33,835
Meera from Milan, later.

125
00:10:34,411 --> 00:10:38,507

00:10:40,417 --> 00:10:42,613

00:10:49,793 --> 00:10:52,763
But imagine, sand dunes, camels.

130
00:10:53,296 --> 00:10:56,459
Extravagant, amazing, stunning India.

131
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,590
For your campaign.

132
00:10:57,701 --> 00:10:58,862
It's going to be the best campaign.

133
00:10:58,935 --> 00:11:00,926
...and no one would've
seen this before.

134
00:11:01,171 --> 00:11:02,229
I am telling you.

135
00:11:02,372 --> 00:11:03,669
Thank God I found you.

136
00:11:05,275 --> 00:11:06,936
Otherwise, in panies like this.

137
00:11:08,612 --> 00:11:11,707
I normally find pervens
who rape me with their eyes.

138
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:15,408
Come, Rads dear. - Where?

139
00:11:15,952 --> 00:11:17,784
Let's go pany, come on.

140
00:11:22,826 --> 00:11:25,227
Meera. - Come on.

141
00:11:25,295 --> 00:11:26,421

Let's have some beer. - Beer.

143
00:11:30,967 --> 00:11:32,628
Come on, Candy. - Coming, coming.

144
00:11:32,702 --> 00:11:33,692
I'm coming.

145
00:11:39,609 --> 00:11:40,599
I am drunk.

146
00:11:41,011 --> 00:11:42,775
I think I am drunk. - Yeah.

147
00:11:43,013 --> 00:11:45,607
Because you're already
four beers down.

148
00:11:46,283 --> 00:11:47,478
Four beers?

149
00:11:48,251 --> 00:11:49,446
But I have a question

150
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:53,984
Why didn't I drink
the founh one directly?

151
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:58,853
Why did I drink one, two and three?
- Because.

152
00:11:58,929 --> 00:12:03,594
Before four, comes three, two and one.

153
00:12:06,403 --> 00:12:09,805
My rustic look..

154
00:12:10,774 --> 00:12:12,037
One more question.

155
00:12:13,076 --> 00:12:14,840
It's an amazing song.

156
00:12:15,478 --> 00:12:17,469
Who made it? - My cousin.

157
00:12:17,547 --> 00:12:18,605
He lives in India.

158
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:21,841
He makes songs for
all of Andi's shows.

159
00:12:21,985 --> 00:12:23,976
Oh..lndia.

161
00:12:27,691 --> 00:12:29,420
What's his name? - Karan.

162
00:12:30,861 --> 00:12:32,056
Oooh!

163
00:12:34,297 --> 00:12:36,425
Hi, Radhika. - Hi, Karan. How are you?

164
00:12:36,499 --> 00:12:37,557
All is well, how are you?

165
00:12:37,734 --> 00:12:40,829
Your song..made my life.

166
00:12:41,471 --> 00:12:44,702
I am telling you, I got so
many compliments for this last show.

167
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:47,506
A supermodel has become
a big fan of yours.

168
00:12:47,644 --> 00:12:48,702
Do one thing, let everyone hear this.

169
00:12:48,778 --> 00:12:50,268
I'll put the phone on speaker. Okay.

170
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,380

Is the jingle ready? - Yes.

180
00:13:15,772 --> 00:13:17,706
The producer's coming
in the evening to hear it.

181
00:13:17,774 --> 00:13:18,468
Hear it.

182
00:13:25,882 --> 00:13:26,815
Stand straight.

183
00:13:29,719 --> 00:13:31,483
Superb..now put your
hand on the shoulder.

184
00:13:35,792 --> 00:13:36,884
Keep changing.

185
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,291
Very good.

186
00:13:43,533 --> 00:13:44,932
Nice smile.

187
00:13:47,904 --> 00:13:49,030
Don't hold the candy.

188
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:53,342
Hold it.

189
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:54,775
Hold it on your eye.

190
00:14:05,922 --> 00:14:07,856
Okay, girls, that's lovely.

191
00:14:08,024 --> 00:14:10,015
Very well done with the setup.

192
00:14:10,427 --> 00:14:11,394
Okay, Meera, now quickly.

193
00:14:11,461 --> 00:14:12,394
Next change. Okay.

194
00:14:12,462 --> 00:14:12,928
Come on, quickly.

195
00:14:12,996 --> 00:14:14,054
Come on, girls. Quickly.

196
00:14:14,297 --> 00:14:15,458
Fine, I'll be right back.

197
00:14:26,409 --> 00:14:27,604
Oh my, God!

198
00:14:30,313 --> 00:14:31,974
Help! Someone help me!

199
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:35,449
Help me.

200
00:14:36,419 --> 00:14:39,582
Please on the lights.

201
00:14:41,758 --> 00:14:42,884
Someone please help me.

202
00:14:43,727 --> 00:14:45,024
I can't breathe.

203
00:14:50,667 --> 00:14:52,965
Help! Help me!

204
00:14:56,706 --> 00:14:58,037
Meera.

205
00:14:59,442 --> 00:15:00,534
Meera.

206
00:15:01,978 --> 00:15:03,639
Oh my, God.
Meera.

207
00:15:03,913 --> 00:15:05,847
Meera, are you okay.

208
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:10,176
Megan, just take her details.

209
00:15:10,487 --> 00:15:12,581
And get back to me. - Okay.

210
00:15:12,889 --> 00:15:14,687
Take care. Bye.

211
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,528
How is she, doctor? - She's fine now.

212
00:15:19,696 --> 00:15:21,494
These are anti-depressant tablets.

213
00:15:21,631 --> 00:15:22,928
She needs to take
it morning and evening.

214
00:15:24,901 --> 00:15:26,767
But she should consult a psychiatrist.

215
00:15:27,003 --> 00:15:30,564
She isn't sick,
just some fear..which is in her mind.

216
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:32,606
Fear? What fear?

217
00:15:32,842 --> 00:15:34,810
I think she's claustrophobic.

218
00:15:34,878 --> 00:15:37,438
She feels scared in closed,
dark spaces.

219
00:15:37,547 --> 00:15:40,278
If there's a sudden power-cut,
or if the liffs stuck.

220
00:15:40,617 --> 00:15:42,551
...she can suffer
a fatal attack as well.

221
00:15:43,653 --> 00:15:46,554
But there must be a reason
for her fear. - Of course.

222
00:15:46,723 --> 00:15:47,918
But she didn't tell me.

223
00:15:48,425 --> 00:15:51,326
You're her friend, you can help her.

224
00:15:51,795 --> 00:15:52,523
0K8'!-

225
00:15:52,962 --> 00:15:53,793
Thank you, doctor.

226
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:58,527
When I was 10, I and my
parents werat travelling by plane.

227
00:15:59,836 --> 00:16:01,235
The plane crashed.

228
00:16:02,505 --> 00:16:06,305
I and an air-hostess
were the sole-survivors.

229
00:16:07,844 --> 00:16:12,509
Since then..l'm scared
of dark and closed places.

230
00:16:14,451 --> 00:16:15,941
Oh my, God. Meera.

231
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,890
But why didn't you
tell the doctor about this?

232
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:25,456
I've told so many doctors.

233
00:16:25,662 --> 00:16:27,960
...that now I've lost the
interest of telling anyone else.

234
00:16:28,565 --> 00:16:29,623
And second.

235
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:35,160
They give me anti-depressant tablets.

236
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,864
"Which I already have.

237
00:16:39,409 --> 00:16:41,275
And. .third.

238
00:16:42,512 --> 00:16:43,877
That doctor wasn't my friend.

239
00:16:50,253 --> 00:16:51,243
Who is it? - Andi.

240
00:16:51,688 --> 00:16:52,712
Hi, Andi.

241
00:16:52,789 --> 00:16:54,314
How are you?

242
00:16:54,524 --> 00:16:55,548
I'm good. With Rads.

243
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:56,456
Girl time.

244
00:16:56,526 --> 00:16:58,255
But actually I need your passport

245
00:16:58,328 --> 00:17:00,387
What is he saying? - Passport? Why?

246
00:17:00,563 --> 00:17:01,894
For a visa.

247
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:04,597
But, Andi, where are we going?

248
00:17:04,667 --> 00:17:06,692
We're going to India, like I told you.

249
00:17:06,936 --> 00:17:09,701
You know, Rajasthamphoto-shoot.

250
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:13,002
But, Andi.. - No ifs or buts.

251
00:17:13,243 --> 00:17:14,574
Send me your passpon quickly.

252
00:17:14,711 --> 00:17:16,201
We need to leave next week.

253
00:17:16,446 --> 00:17:17,845
Andi, I can't do this.

254
00:17:17,981 --> 00:17:19,779
Let's be serious now.

255
00:17:19,883 --> 00:17:22,250
I'm sending my assistant,
you send your passport

256
00:17:22,552 --> 00:17:24,543
Andi, I am serious. Don't push me.

257
00:17:24,687 --> 00:17:26,416
Even/thing's locked, the deal is done.

258
00:17:27,223 --> 00:17:28,452
Hire some other model.

259
00:17:28,691 --> 00:17:29,487
Meera.

260
00:17:30,026 --> 00:17:31,619
Look.. - I am sorry.

261
00:17:31,728 --> 00:17:32,820
Hello. - I can't do it.

262
00:17:32,996 --> 00:17:34,657
Meera? Hello.

263
00:17:34,764 --> 00:17:35,731
What happened?

264
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:37,890
You know how Andi can be?

265
00:17:38,268 --> 00:17:39,565
He's a bit crazy. - Yes.

266
00:17:39,636 --> 00:17:40,364
Let's go.

267
00:17:41,604 --> 00:17:42,901
Oh my, God!

268
00:17:43,406 --> 00:17:46,569
I didn't know Meera had
such a painful backstory.

269
00:17:46,843 --> 00:17:48,333
Because she cannot fly.

270
00:17:48,912 --> 00:17:51,279
She's scared. She gets panic attacks.

271
00:17:51,381 --> 00:17:52,644
I'll be ruined.

272
00:17:53,049 --> 00:17:54,574
This Smith. He..

273
00:17:54,651 --> 00:17:55,743
He will sue me!

274
00:17:56,286 --> 00:17:57,412
Andi, take a breath.

275
00:17:58,555 --> 00:17:59,522
Look, Andi.

276
00:18:00,557 --> 00:18:04,516
If you have a fear in your heart
you should face it.

277
00:18:04,594 --> 00:18:05,755
Face our fears

278
00:18:05,895 --> 00:18:06,794
I see.

279
00:18:06,863 --> 00:18:10,493
You want me to go to Smith,
face him and say..

280
00:18:10,567 --> 00:18:11,898
"Meera is not available."

281
00:18:12,135 --> 00:18:14,297
I didn't mean you, I meant Meera.

282
00:18:14,437 --> 00:18:15,370
Don't do any1hing.

283
00:18:15,538 --> 00:18:16,733
I'll handle every1hing, okay.

284
00:18:16,839 --> 00:18:17,738
Oh, great!

285
00:18:17,807 --> 00:18:19,104
Look, I'm going to India.

286
00:18:19,175 --> 00:18:20,165
I've to arrange every1hing.

287
00:18:20,243 --> 00:18:21,472
I've to get the locations locked.

288
00:18:21,544 --> 00:18:23,239
You get her there by hook,
or by crook.

289
00:18:23,313 --> 00:18:25,611
I'll do it.
I said I'll do it. Just calm down.

290
00:18:25,815 --> 00:18:26,782
Karan. - Yeah.

291
00:18:26,849 --> 00:18:27,475
Here.

292
00:18:28,151 --> 00:18:29,141
I've copied this.

293
00:18:29,419 --> 00:18:30,614
Clean-up the sound by tomorrow.

294
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:32,117
Fine, you can do that.

295
00:18:32,388 --> 00:18:33,253
But let me hear first.

296
00:18:33,356 --> 00:18:34,152
I might get a new idea.

297
00:18:34,224 --> 00:18:34,588
Yeah, play it.

298
00:18:34,657 --> 00:18:36,557
Stop messing around.

299
00:18:36,626 --> 00:18:38,856
Let's just watch
the match now. Please.

300
00:18:39,128 --> 00:18:41,256
Yeah, they're all sons
of Messi here. Right.

301
00:18:41,464 --> 00:18:42,522
Let's watch the match.

302
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:44,328
Fine then, let's watch the match.

303
00:18:44,467 --> 00:18:45,298
Thank you.

304
00:18:47,804 --> 00:18:48,896
What's that?

305
00:18:52,642 --> 00:18:55,509
Guys. Look what I found.

306
00:18:59,282 --> 00:19:01,216
Do you know what this is?

307
00:19:02,185 --> 00:19:02,947
What?

308
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:06,354
Lemon and chilly. - Ohh!

309
00:19:06,723 --> 00:19:08,213
It protects the house.

310
00:19:08,524 --> 00:19:10,424
He's gone crazy. - Correct.

311
00:19:10,493 --> 00:19:11,927
Stop joking all of you.

312
00:19:11,995 --> 00:19:13,394
You don't know.

313
00:19:13,563 --> 00:19:15,292
It keeps evil spirits out of our home.

314
00:19:15,365 --> 00:19:16,662
Yeah, just like I'm
going to throw this out.

315
00:19:16,733 --> 00:19:17,791
What are you doing?

316
00:19:17,867 --> 00:19:20,666
I'll slap you silly.

317
00:19:20,737 --> 00:19:22,762
And hang you at the door.

318
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:23,772
Look.. - Shut up.

319
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,535
Listen, the second
half's going to begin.

320
00:19:25,608 --> 00:19:26,666
Switch on the game.

321
00:19:26,743 --> 00:19:28,438
Such a bore.

322
00:21:07,009 --> 00:21:15,781
"Without you..my heart's restless."

323
00:21:15,918 --> 00:21:19,377
"Come back to me, beloved."

324
00:21:20,757 --> 00:21:21,815
Leela.

325
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:23,619
"Without you..my heart's restless."

326
00:21:24,127 --> 00:21:28,462
Leela's statue will be unique.

327
00:21:42,445 --> 00:21:44,345
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. Thank you.

328
00:21:44,414 --> 00:21:46,678
He's riding the bike, I'll tell him.

329
00:21:46,749 --> 00:21:48,217
Thank you, thank you.

330
00:21:48,818 --> 00:21:52,846
Karan, Harpal really loved
the jingle we made for his ad.

331
00:21:52,922 --> 00:21:55,584
He's coming in the evening,
with a cheque.

332
00:21:55,925 --> 00:21:56,858
Karan.

333
00:21:57,226 --> 00:21:59,354
Karan. Are you listening?

334
00:22:00,463 --> 00:22:04,832
Rajiv, did you hear the
record I gave you for cleanup?

335
00:22:05,468 --> 00:22:06,799
Yes. - One that we found in the truck.

336
00:22:07,236 --> 00:22:07,828
Yes, I did.

337
00:22:07,904 --> 00:22:09,201
I cleaned up the sound.

338
00:22:10,373 --> 00:22:12,171
Did you feel anything
while listening to it?

339
00:22:12,408 --> 00:22:15,378
Feel? It's amazing.

340
00:22:15,678 --> 00:22:17,510
I even made it my ringtone.

341
00:22:17,647 --> 00:22:18,739
Did you hear it? - No!

342
00:22:20,516 --> 00:22:21,506
I didn't hear it.

343
00:22:21,651 --> 00:22:23,210
Karan, it's a fantastic song, Karan.

344
00:22:23,286 --> 00:22:24,583
We'll make a great remix of it.

345
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:42,534
"L'm in a party mood."

346
00:22:42,605 --> 00:22:44,300
"Take me shopping dude."

347
00:22:44,373 --> 00:22:46,171
"Give me Dollars or Pounds."

348
00:22:46,242 --> 00:22:47,801
"Oh my love, don't be rude."

349
00:22:47,877 --> 00:22:49,641
"l'm in a party mood."

350
00:22:49,712 --> 00:22:51,441
"Take me shopping dude."

351
00:22:51,514 --> 00:22:53,209
"Give me Dollars or Pounds."

352
00:22:53,282 --> 00:22:55,376
"Oh my love, don't be rude."

353
00:22:55,485 --> 00:22:57,317
"Rude. ."

354
00:22:57,386 --> 00:22:58,876
"Rude. ."

355
00:22:59,121 --> 00:23:00,714
"One, two, three, four.."

356
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:02,519
"My arms are on your waist."

357
00:23:02,592 --> 00:23:04,321
"My hands are being naughty."

358
00:23:04,393 --> 00:23:06,122
"Let's not go back home."

359
00:23:06,195 --> 00:23:07,754
"One, two, three, four.."

360
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:09,559
"My arms on your waist."

361
00:23:09,632 --> 00:23:11,430
"My hands are being naughty."

362
00:23:11,501 --> 00:23:13,526
"Let's not go back home."

363
00:23:14,103 --> 00:23:16,572
I've heard that a themed
restaurant just opened up.

364
00:23:16,639 --> 00:23:18,630
And you know what,
it looks like an airplane.

365
00:23:18,708 --> 00:23:20,233
Plane? - Plane!

366
00:23:20,409 --> 00:23:22,104
But it's a restaurant, right?
- Exactly.

367
00:23:23,779 --> 00:23:25,873
Shall we party in the evening?

368
00:23:27,183 --> 00:23:30,517

Cheers.

371
00:23:34,757 --> 00:23:36,486
One more, one more.

372
00:23:36,893 --> 00:23:38,520
I finished it.

373
00:23:39,395 --> 00:23:39,918
Yeah!

374
00:23:40,162 --> 00:23:41,288
We should get one more.

375
00:23:41,497 --> 00:23:43,158
No, I think you've had enough.

376
00:23:43,633 --> 00:23:45,397
No, no, cheating.

377
00:23:48,638 --> 00:23:50,333
One more! One more!

378
00:23:50,473 --> 00:23:52,237

Hi, girls.
How are you? - How is everybody?

384
00:24:22,905 --> 00:24:24,669
'My rustic look..'

385
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:26,538
"Fair boys."

386
00:24:28,444 --> 00:24:30,310
But don't drink too
much on the flight, okay?

387
00:24:30,379 --> 00:24:31,505
Rads!

388
00:24:32,315 --> 00:24:34,283

You're safe, okay.

Meera, l..want to confess something.

436
00:26:30,166 --> 00:26:34,399
We're on a flight heading to India.

437
00:26:35,371 --> 00:26:37,772
But look, don't.

438
00:26:49,251 --> 00:26:53,916

Meera, we're in India. Jaisalmer.

445
00:27:11,407 --> 00:27:13,876
Rads!

446
00:27:14,243 --> 00:27:17,008
Just for a contract,
you both put my life at risk.

447
00:27:17,246 --> 00:27:19,442
Meera, I was only
trying to help you out.

448
00:27:19,515 --> 00:27:21,779
Like this? By getting me drunk.

449
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:23,474
What if I had woken up?

450
00:27:23,619 --> 00:27:24,882
I could've gotten a stroke!

451
00:27:26,021 --> 00:27:28,820
It's not your help, Radhika.
It's stupidity!

452
00:27:29,692 --> 00:27:32,787
What if..l had a panic-attack!

453
00:27:33,229 --> 00:27:35,994
No one could've helped me.
Not you or you.

454
00:27:36,232 --> 00:27:37,791
You would've watched me die,
that's it.

455
00:27:38,934 --> 00:27:41,403
I want to go, right now!

456
00:27:42,271 --> 00:27:42,863
B'! Plane?

457
00:27:44,507 --> 00:27:45,440
Shut up, Andi.

458
00:27:47,476 --> 00:27:48,841
I want to go, now.

459
00:27:48,911 --> 00:27:50,037
Meera, calm down.

460
00:27:50,479 --> 00:27:52,311
Okay. I am sorry.

461
00:27:52,414 --> 00:27:54,382
I didn't think I was
doing anything wrong.

462
00:27:55,484 --> 00:27:56,747
I swear on God!

463
00:27:58,387 --> 00:28:02,051
Look..we'll do as you say. Okay.

464
00:28:02,391 --> 00:28:04,587
But we need some time
to arrange every1hing.

465
00:28:04,727 --> 00:28:05,990
Please, understand.

466
00:28:06,762 --> 00:28:08,560
Meera. Meera.

467
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:30,750
Meera!

468
00:29:00,883 --> 00:29:02,180
Andi, I'm completely famished.

469
00:29:02,251 --> 00:29:03,980
Can we stop somewhere to eat?
- Yeah, yeah.

470
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:04,948
There's an eatery close-by.

471
00:29:05,187 --> 00:29:06,416
Driver, let's go to the eatery.

472
00:29:16,699 --> 00:29:18,258
Would you like to eat something?

473
00:29:18,801 --> 00:29:19,563
Some tea or coffee?

474
00:29:19,635 --> 00:29:21,160
Okay, girls,
we're going to be eating here.

475
00:29:21,237 --> 00:29:22,295
Just be careful of the water.

476
00:29:22,371 --> 00:29:23,497
Just have packaged water, okay.

477
00:29:23,572 --> 00:29:24,403
Quickly. Quickly.

478
00:29:24,473 --> 00:29:25,838
Don't you make that face at me!

479
00:29:26,242 --> 00:29:29,610
Meera, it would be really
nice if you eat something.

480
00:29:29,678 --> 00:29:30,543
Okay, never mind.

481
00:29:30,613 --> 00:29:31,637
You don't have to.. Okay.

482
00:29:31,847 --> 00:29:33,372
What are we going to do? - Just relax.

483
00:29:33,582 --> 00:29:34,811
She's furious.
- It's okay, just relax.

484
00:29:34,884 --> 00:29:35,749
She won't do any1hing.

485
00:29:35,818 --> 00:29:37,377
Stop, calm down. - Oh my, God.

486
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:38,145
Have some water.

487
00:29:55,638 --> 00:29:57,037
Forget that, Andi.

488
00:29:57,206 --> 00:29:59,573
Think about how you're going
to send Meera back tomorrow.

489
00:29:59,808 --> 00:30:02,140
That's what worries me, Rads.

490
00:30:03,345 --> 00:30:04,471
I'm telling you, Andi.

491
00:30:05,347 --> 00:30:07,611
If Meera goes, I go too. - What?

492
00:30:07,716 --> 00:30:09,081
What about our friendship?
- I don't know.

493
00:30:09,151 --> 00:30:10,710
What about us?
- I've said what I've said, Andi.

494
00:30:10,786 --> 00:30:12,413
Who will do the shoot? - I don't know.

495
00:30:12,488 --> 00:30:13,751
You can't do this to me.

496
00:30:28,404 --> 00:30:29,462
What are they doing?

497
00:30:29,605 --> 00:30:32,336
Madam, that's an age-old game..

498
00:30:32,408 --> 00:30:34,342
"Which the girls of
Rajasthan have been playing.

499
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:51,593
I'm completely famished.

500
00:30:51,994 --> 00:30:53,393
What did you eat?

501
00:30:54,997 --> 00:30:55,987
"Daal-Baati"!

502
00:30:56,198 --> 00:30:57,359
"Daal-Baati"?

503
00:30:58,167 --> 00:30:59,566
Never heard of it before.

504
00:31:00,035 --> 00:31:04,302
But..l'm sure it'll be nice.
Just like every1hing here.

505
00:31:06,141 --> 00:31:07,131
Andi!

506
00:31:07,309 --> 00:31:08,435
Tomorrow.

507
00:31:09,044 --> 00:31:10,170
What time?

508
00:31:12,381 --> 00:31:13,473
Is the call time?

509
00:31:16,218 --> 00:31:17,014
Andi.

510
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:18,712
Hey, Radhika, welcome to India.

We're here for another 20-25 days.

Take him to the hospital.

Are you all at the police station?

534
00:32:29,425 --> 00:32:30,449
Are they filing a case?

535
00:32:30,592 --> 00:32:31,525

00:33:05,961 --> 00:33:06,928
Stop Leela.

545
00:33:07,162 --> 00:33:08,323
Leela!

546
00:33:08,397 --> 00:33:11,298
'Leela's statue will be unique.'

547
00:33:16,972 --> 00:33:18,701
'Angel in the form of human.'

548
00:33:18,774 --> 00:33:19,969
Leela..belongs to Shravan.

549
00:33:22,444 --> 00:33:23,934
Leela!

550
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,538
'Come with me.'

551
00:33:25,981 --> 00:33:30,179
Leela's statue will be unique.

552
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:31,980
'Beautiful looks.'

553
00:33:32,287 --> 00:33:33,618
Excuse me. What happened?

554
00:33:34,857 --> 00:33:36,552
Only Shravan.

555
00:33:39,361 --> 00:33:41,329
My name's Leela. Leela.

556
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:43,760
Leela!

557
00:33:45,634 --> 00:33:47,659
Karan. - Leela!

558
00:33:47,736 --> 00:33:48,965
Kumar, get some water quickly.

559
00:33:50,706 --> 00:33:51,798
Karan.

560
00:33:52,307 --> 00:33:53,206
Sit.

561
00:33:53,809 --> 00:33:55,004
Karan, what happened?

562
00:33:55,377 --> 00:33:55,969
Karan.

563
00:33:56,645 --> 00:33:57,407
Karan.

564
00:33:57,846 --> 00:33:58,836
Are you okay?

565
00:33:59,615 --> 00:34:00,582
What happened?

566
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:02,376
Madam.

567
00:34:02,551 --> 00:34:04,019
Are you okay?

568
00:34:11,693 --> 00:34:12,626
Take your medicines.

569
00:34:21,403 --> 00:34:22,427
Who is Leela?

570
00:34:24,373 --> 00:34:25,465
I don't know.

571
00:34:25,841 --> 00:34:26,808
You don't know?

572
00:34:27,209 --> 00:34:28,370
So..where did you get that name?

573
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:30,171
Since the day I
arrived in this house.

574
00:34:30,612 --> 00:34:32,376
...l've been seeing strange dreams.

575
00:34:33,615 --> 00:34:34,480
What dreams?

576
00:34:35,684 --> 00:34:36,480
I don't know.

577
00:34:36,585 --> 00:34:37,609
Since the day I moved in here..

578
00:34:37,819 --> 00:34:40,220
...l've been hearing strange sounds.

579
00:34:40,289 --> 00:34:41,984
And I see the same dream all the time.

580
00:34:42,391 --> 00:34:44,917
Rajiv, I've grown
so tired of all this.

581
00:34:45,661 --> 00:34:48,790
Karan, somethings wrong.

582
00:34:49,398 --> 00:34:50,627
Somethings definitely wrong.

583
00:34:50,933 --> 00:34:51,900
We need to do something.

584
00:34:53,335 --> 00:34:56,737
'Sanskrit chants'

585
00:34:56,939 --> 00:35:01,536
'Sanskrit chants'

586
00:35:02,311 --> 00:35:06,373
'Sanskrit chants'

587
00:35:06,648 --> 00:35:07,672
Hey, Karan.

588
00:35:07,883 --> 00:35:09,476
This house is definitely haunted.

589
00:35:11,486 --> 00:35:13,420
There are no ghosts
or spirits in this house.

590
00:35:14,456 --> 00:35:16,515
What about female spirits?

591
00:35:16,892 --> 00:35:19,361
Like I said..he was
talking about some Leela.

592
00:35:20,862 --> 00:35:22,796
No, it's not what you think.

593
00:35:23,265 --> 00:35:26,496
But my dreams. What's all that?

594
00:35:26,568 --> 00:35:28,696
I can't tell you about that.

595
00:35:29,538 --> 00:35:31,973
But whatever it is, it's not good.

596
00:35:34,276 --> 00:35:36,244
You two come see my Guru.

597
00:35:37,112 --> 00:35:40,548
He can chalk out your problems,
and also find a solution.

598
00:35:41,283 --> 00:35:42,478
Your Guru..

599
00:35:43,518 --> 00:35:45,282
Have you heard about 'Nadi-Shashtra'?

600
00:35:45,354 --> 00:35:46,378
Yes, I have.

601
00:35:46,488 --> 00:35:47,717
Something written on old leaves..

602
00:35:47,789 --> 00:35:49,382
They are scripts.

603
00:35:50,559 --> 00:35:53,426
It contains all the details
of every human being..

604
00:35:53,729 --> 00:35:56,824
...from the time of
his birth until his death.

605
00:35:57,165 --> 00:35:58,826
Like..palmistry or astrology.

606
00:35:59,067 --> 00:36:01,832
'Nadi-Shashtra is
no ordinary astrology.

607
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:06,701
4000 years ago,
the great sage Agustya invented this.

608
00:36:06,842 --> 00:36:09,402
'Nadi-Shashtra' doesn't
make assumptions.

609
00:36:09,711 --> 00:36:12,442
In fact, it tells you the truth.

610
00:36:12,514 --> 00:36:14,642
So, let's go there now. - No.

611
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:16,779
We can't go there now.

612
00:36:17,519 --> 00:36:20,545
Today I will only take
his thumb impression.

613
00:36:20,689 --> 00:36:22,555
You can come see me four days later.

614
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:29,858
Until then, may Lord
protect you from all troubles.

615
00:36:30,365 --> 00:36:31,457
Hail Lord.

616
00:36:58,393 --> 00:37:01,693
"L have forsaken my throne for you."

617
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:05,562
"Come rule my heart."

618
00:37:07,336 --> 00:37:10,601
"O beloved.."

619
00:37:10,672 --> 00:37:14,631
"My beloved."

620
00:37:16,144 --> 00:37:18,909
"..your glamorous eyes."

621
00:37:20,182 --> 00:37:22,344
"..your glamorous eyes."

622
00:37:23,285 --> 00:37:26,846
"They're now my best friends."

623
00:37:27,255 --> 00:37:29,553
"..your glamorous eyes."

624
00:37:30,359 --> 00:37:33,351
"O beloved.."

625
00:37:33,729 --> 00:37:37,359
"My beloved.."

626
00:37:37,432 --> 00:37:40,834
"..your glamorous eyes."

627
00:37:41,436 --> 00:37:43,632
"..your glamorous eyes."

628
00:37:44,539 --> 00:37:46,633
"They're now my best friends."

629
00:37:48,343 --> 00:37:49,936
"..your glamorous eyes."

630
00:37:59,354 --> 00:38:01,288
Okay, I think we're done
with this angle now. - Okay.

631
00:38:01,356 --> 00:38:02,687
Okay. We'll stan with this one.

632
00:38:02,758 --> 00:38:05,591
It's just thatihose flags. - Flags..

633
00:38:06,061 --> 00:38:07,586
Listen, Andi.

634
00:38:08,563 --> 00:38:09,530
No!

635
00:38:13,635 --> 00:38:16,969
"My veil..flies in the breeze."

636
00:38:17,038 --> 00:38:21,373
"And my beloved runs after it."

637
00:38:23,645 --> 00:38:26,876
"Listen to the call of my heart."

638
00:38:26,948 --> 00:38:30,578
"Don't humiliate my love."

639
00:38:30,652 --> 00:38:37,820
"My hear1's..only for you."

640
00:38:38,293 --> 00:38:40,955
"..your glamorous eyes."

641
00:38:41,363 --> 00:38:44,799
"O beloved.."

642
00:38:44,866 --> 00:38:48,325
"My beloved."

643
00:38:48,437 --> 00:38:52,396
"..your glamorous eyes."

644
00:38:52,474 --> 00:38:55,466
"..your glamorous eyes."

645
00:38:55,544 --> 00:38:59,071
"They're now my best friends."

646
00:38:59,514 --> 00:39:01,482
"..your glamorous eyes."

647
00:39:03,351 --> 00:39:04,876
Hey, what's going on here?

648
00:39:05,854 --> 00:39:06,480
Who is he?

649
00:39:06,555 --> 00:39:08,319
Who are these people?
- Greetings, brother.

650
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:09,084
Greetings.

651
00:39:09,391 --> 00:39:10,324
They are shooting here.

652
00:39:10,392 --> 00:39:11,416
They are from abroad.

653
00:39:11,493 --> 00:39:13,621
Who gave them permission
to shoot here?

654
00:39:13,695 --> 00:39:16,892
We've permission, from the Police.

655
00:39:16,965 --> 00:39:18,729
This place doesn't
belong to the police.

656
00:39:18,867 --> 00:39:19,766
Oh my, God.

657
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:22,128
Flags?

658
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:23,496
Who took the flags out?

659
00:39:23,572 --> 00:39:25,062
Wha..what?

660
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:26,505
What's he saying?

661
00:39:26,842 --> 00:39:29,573
He means flags. - Flags?

662
00:39:30,512 --> 00:39:31,809
We took them out.

663
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:34,440
It was interfering with our shot,
ruining it.

664
00:39:34,649 --> 00:39:35,980
Ruining your shot?

665
00:39:36,485 --> 00:39:38,044
What have you done?

666
00:39:38,119 --> 00:39:40,417
Bhoop Singh, come quickly.

667
00:39:40,522 --> 00:39:41,455
Boop Singh?

668
00:39:41,523 --> 00:39:43,651
Sir.. Sir, I tried telling you before.

669
00:39:43,725 --> 00:39:44,817
This area belongs to the Prince.

670
00:39:54,736 --> 00:39:56,067
Move.

671
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:00,066
Oh my, God!

672
00:40:16,691 --> 00:40:17,658
Who are these people?

673
00:40:17,726 --> 00:40:19,319
Sir. - What are they doing on my land?

674
00:40:19,394 --> 00:40:20,384
Sir..they are foreigners.

675
00:40:20,462 --> 00:40:21,554
They claim to be shooting here.

676
00:40:21,796 --> 00:40:23,662
And they say that they've

679
00:40:31,506 --> 00:40:32,496
Let them shoot.

680
00:40:32,574 --> 00:40:33,769
They're guests of Rajasthan.

681
00:40:33,909 --> 00:40:34,569
Okay sir.

682
00:40:50,492 --> 00:40:52,460

00:40:54,429 --> 00:40:55,828
And now dinner invitation.

00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:06,836
"Welcome to my country."

686
00:41:09,444 --> 00:41:10,775
I am Maan Singh.

687
00:41:11,346 --> 00:41:13,940
"Khamba Ghani"! - What?

688
00:41:14,015 --> 00:41:16,643
I say "Goodnight".

689
00:41:16,851 --> 00:41:18,478
Why is he saying goodnight?

690
00:41:18,753 --> 00:41:19,948
Should we go back?

691
00:41:20,021 --> 00:41:21,489
Please..welcome.

692
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:23,719
Follow me. Yes.

693
00:41:24,693 --> 00:41:26,127
By the way, what does the Prince do?

694
00:41:26,361 --> 00:41:27,851
Ma'am, he's the Prince.

695
00:41:28,029 --> 00:41:30,521
He doesn't have the
need to do any1hing.

696
00:41:30,932 --> 00:41:35,369
He just returned from
London few months ago.

697
00:41:35,637 --> 00:41:38,334
And his family? - Here they are.

698
00:41:38,773 --> 00:41:40,605
The Prince's mother and father.

699
00:41:40,675 --> 00:41:44,373
They passed away when
the Prince was just a kid.

700
00:41:44,479 --> 00:41:45,571
Anyway, let it be.

701
00:41:45,647 --> 00:41:46,842
I'll show you something else.

702
00:41:46,915 --> 00:41:47,939
Come. - Let's go.

703
00:41:48,883 --> 00:41:50,442
Come, come.

Rads, see this.

705
00:42:01,696 --> 00:42:03,164
It's just a chest, Andi.

706
00:42:03,398 --> 00:42:04,388
Come on, let's go.

707
00:42:04,599 --> 00:42:05,157
H9'!-

00:42:10,872 --> 00:42:13,842
Don't touch..by this hand.

709
00:42:14,376 --> 00:42:17,971
It's forbidden to touch anything here.

710
00:42:19,581 --> 00:42:21,379
Oh my, God! - Wow!

711
00:42:21,549 --> 00:42:25,679
Look at this beautiful
'Deewan-e-khaas' (Hall).

712
00:42:28,890 --> 00:42:29,948
It's so nice.

713
00:42:30,825 --> 00:42:32,452
See that fountain. - Stunning.

714
00:42:32,527 --> 00:42:33,824
Oh, I could live here.

729
00:43:28,683 --> 00:43:30,913
Foreign language

730
00:43:31,386 --> 00:43:35,016
Foreign language

731
00:43:36,458 --> 00:43:39,758
Foreign language

732
00:43:40,428 --> 00:43:41,623
You speak French.

733
00:43:41,696 --> 00:43:42,993
Just a little.

734
00:43:44,132 --> 00:43:45,600
I know little French.

735
00:43:45,867 --> 00:43:46,800
It's not difficult.

736
00:43:57,712 --> 00:44:01,546
Guys, our Prince knows all languages.

737
00:44:01,616 --> 00:44:04,677
What's that? - I mean languages.

738
00:44:04,753 --> 00:44:05,982
What language do you know?

739
00:44:06,287 --> 00:44:14,388
I knows..Hindi, English,
Punjabi, Bengali, Portuguese, etc.

740
00:44:14,696 --> 00:44:15,993
What language is that?

741
00:44:16,498 --> 00:44:21,527
It's my common language.

742
00:44:33,815 --> 00:44:36,113
The food was good. - A bit spicy.

743
00:44:36,384 --> 00:44:38,443
You liked the food.

744
00:44:38,887 --> 00:44:43,017
Now..take mine. - What is that?

745
00:44:43,091 --> 00:44:44,525
'Paan' (betel-leaf)!

746
00:44:44,659 --> 00:44:46,388
Pick it up slowly.

747
00:44:46,628 --> 00:44:49,563
Put it in your mouth. Chew it.

748
00:44:49,731 --> 00:44:52,132
And..suck it.

749
00:44:55,436 --> 00:44:56,699
That's my great grandfather.

750
00:44:57,872 --> 00:44:59,362
He built this palace.

751
00:45:00,675 --> 00:45:02,109
He fought many battles
in his lifetime.

752
00:45:03,044 --> 00:45:04,443
He was a great warrior.

753
00:45:05,947 --> 00:45:08,917
But you seem a little different.

754
00:45:09,751 --> 00:45:11,549
There's a huge Buddha in your palace.

755
00:45:13,121 --> 00:45:14,714
Buddha gives me peace.

756
00:45:15,089 --> 00:45:17,080
And you know, he was also a prince.

757
00:45:18,593 --> 00:45:19,492
True.

758
00:45:19,727 --> 00:45:24,130
But he also gave up his kingdom,
and lived as a poor man.

759
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:28,770
Even I was quite poor once. - Really?

760
00:45:29,737 --> 00:45:30,795
Just kidding.

761
00:45:32,841 --> 00:45:34,935
Wow! What a collection?

762
00:45:35,109 --> 00:45:35,905
Great.

763
00:45:36,477 --> 00:45:37,638
Did your dad love reading books?

764
00:45:37,712 --> 00:45:39,840
Yeah, dad loved reading.

765
00:45:40,415 --> 00:45:42,144
I heard about your parents.

766
00:45:43,785 --> 00:45:45,150
God can't be so rude.

767
00:45:45,887 --> 00:45:47,981
I believe, when Lord takes
something away from you..

768
00:45:48,056 --> 00:45:51,959
...he empties both your hands,
to give you something better.

769
00:45:52,827 --> 00:45:54,556
I am sad about my parent's demise.

770
00:45:54,696 --> 00:45:57,188
But you can't spend your
life surrounded by grief.

771
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:00,065
You can be overwhelmed by grief..

772
00:46:00,435 --> 00:46:02,403
"But you shouldn't
let it be permanent.

773
00:46:02,570 --> 00:46:04,038
We should always throw it away.

774
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:06,098
Right.

775
00:46:07,141 --> 00:46:08,540
It's beautiful.

776
00:46:10,879 --> 00:46:11,710
Beautiful, right?

777
00:46:11,813 --> 00:46:12,712
Yes.

778
00:46:12,947 --> 00:46:16,713
It'll be just fantastic
if we can shoot here. - I know.

779
00:46:16,985 --> 00:46:18,475
But what about Maan Singh?

780
00:46:18,753 --> 00:46:20,118
He doesn't even let us touch any1hing.

781
00:46:20,588 --> 00:46:21,885
Will he allow us to shoot here?

782
00:46:22,924 --> 00:46:23,652
So what do we do?

783
00:46:29,697 --> 00:46:31,028
I have an idea.

784
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:32,999
Meera!

785
00:46:34,802 --> 00:46:35,860
You're most welcome.

786
00:46:36,004 --> 00:46:37,028
And the pleasure was mine.

787
00:46:37,705 --> 00:46:39,833
Meera, don't you
have something to say?

788
00:46:40,508 --> 00:46:41,100
Andi. - Rads?

789
00:46:41,342 --> 00:46:41,672
What?

790
00:46:41,943 --> 00:46:43,604
Yeah, Meera, l..

791
00:46:44,579 --> 00:46:45,569
Yes, Meera?

792
00:46:47,815 --> 00:46:52,548
ActuallyRads and Andi
loved your palace. - Yeah.

793
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:56,318
Didn't you like it?
- Yes, I loved it too.

794
00:46:56,524 --> 00:47:00,859
But we're here to shoot,
and they were thinking.

795
00:47:00,929 --> 00:47:01,623
Be my guest.

796
00:47:01,829 --> 00:47:02,694
It's all yours.

797
00:47:03,131 --> 00:47:04,963
Every1hing will be just the way it is.

798
00:47:05,033 --> 00:47:05,898
We won't.

799
00:47:06,668 --> 00:47:07,726
I'll see you tomorrow.

800
00:47:09,604 --> 00:47:19,537
"When the Lord sees you with me?"

801
00:47:19,614 --> 00:47:22,413
Your highness, shall we? - Let's go.

802
00:47:24,118 --> 00:47:33,391
"When the Lord sees you with me."

803
00:47:33,795 --> 00:47:37,095
"He must be wondering.."

804
00:47:37,165 --> 00:47:44,663
"..how could He give
me such a valuable thing."

805
00:47:45,039 --> 00:47:47,064
"You're amazing."

806
00:47:47,542 --> 00:47:49,567
"There are no words to describe you."

807
00:47:49,877 --> 00:47:52,141
"You've descended from the sky."

808
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:54,439
"That's all I would say."

809
00:47:54,749 --> 00:47:59,152
"lf someone still
asks..who or what you are."

810
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:04,456
"l would just scatter
colors in the air."

811
00:48:04,592 --> 00:48:06,720
"..scatter colors in the air."

812
00:48:07,729 --> 00:48:16,865
"When the Lord sees you with me?"

813
00:48:17,538 --> 00:48:20,701
Mr. Lawyer,
if this case proceeds like this.

814
00:48:20,775 --> 00:48:22,140
"Then it will never end.

815
00:48:22,510 --> 00:48:26,174
Your highness, please see
Vikram once and talk to him.

816
00:48:26,481 --> 00:48:28,210
That's the lawyer's
suggestion as well.

817
00:48:29,450 --> 00:48:31,009
What does brother Vikram want?

818
00:48:32,053 --> 00:48:32,986
Talk to him.

819
00:48:33,087 --> 00:48:33,781
Yes, your highness.

820
00:48:49,804 --> 00:48:58,474
"The land..you set foot on."

821
00:48:59,514 --> 00:49:07,786
"The touch of your
feet..turns it into heaven."

822
00:49:08,990 --> 00:49:11,618
"All the adornment in the world.."

823
00:49:11,692 --> 00:49:13,558
"..seem faded compared to you."

824
00:49:13,861 --> 00:49:18,389
"Not just me,
even the Angels are crazy about you."

825
00:49:18,733 --> 00:49:23,295
"You're the breeze in summer,
the sunlight in winter."

826
00:49:23,671 --> 00:49:29,940
"All the weathers owe to you."

827
00:49:31,779 --> 00:49:40,881
"When the Lord sees your attitude."

828
00:49:41,556 --> 00:49:44,821
"He must be wondering.."

829
00:49:44,892 --> 00:49:51,798
"..how could He give
me such a valuable thing."

830
00:50:02,477 --> 00:50:03,672
Meera, your tablets.

831
00:50:03,878 --> 00:50:05,073
I completely forgot them.

832
00:50:05,513 --> 00:50:06,776
I know why.

833
00:50:06,848 --> 00:50:08,942
Some things are best forgotten.

834
00:50:09,117 --> 00:50:10,881
You were right.

835
00:50:10,952 --> 00:50:15,753
Sorrows can be overwhelming,
but they can't be permanent.

836
00:50:15,823 --> 00:50:18,588
But I also said.. You
should always throw it away.

837
00:50:19,594 --> 00:50:20,459
Okay!

838
00:50:23,099 --> 00:50:24,999
Rajiv.

839
00:50:26,135 --> 00:50:27,569
Where's the priest?

840
00:50:29,639 --> 00:50:31,630
Guru's been waiting for you.

841
00:50:32,308 --> 00:50:35,573
Come. Every1hing will be fine.

842
00:50:41,317 --> 00:50:42,284
Guru..

843
00:50:43,252 --> 00:50:45,050
Guru, please help me.

844
00:50:45,888 --> 00:50:48,323
Since I shifted in this house,
not a moment of peace.

845
00:50:50,994 --> 00:50:52,257
I know..

846
00:50:53,062 --> 00:50:55,292
It's because you didn't
shift in the house alone.

847
00:50:56,232 --> 00:51:00,260
You brought some
unwanted memories along.

848
00:51:02,138 --> 00:51:04,106
Memories? - Yes, memories.

849
00:51:04,707 --> 00:51:06,197
Of your past life.

850
00:51:08,044 --> 00:51:12,277
Past life? - Yes.

851
00:51:13,950 --> 00:51:18,251
You're a pan of a 300
year old incomplete story.

852
00:51:19,022 --> 00:51:22,686
And you've been bestowed
this life to complete it.

853
00:51:27,296 --> 00:51:28,730
Guru, what's the story?

854
00:51:30,033 --> 00:51:32,161
To know that, I tried to find..

855
00:51:32,869 --> 00:51:35,668
"The 'Nadi-patra' of your past life.

856
00:51:36,305 --> 00:51:38,205
But I couldn't find it.

857
00:51:38,708 --> 00:51:41,837
And without it the
solution of your problem.

858
00:51:43,579 --> 00:51:46,014
What is that?

859
00:51:47,150 --> 00:51:48,345
Is not there.

860
00:51:52,655 --> 00:51:56,751
But according to your star-sign,
your binh time"

861
00:51:57,126 --> 00:52:02,087
...your stars and constellations,
we've found..

862
00:52:02,398 --> 00:52:06,198
...few pages,
which coincides with another woman.

863
00:52:07,103 --> 00:52:10,129
And her name..was Leela!

864
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:12,965
Guru, that's the
name he keeps repeating.

865
00:52:13,076 --> 00:52:16,102
That's the name he
thinks about in his dreams.

866
00:52:16,179 --> 00:52:19,672
He will, because it's
an indication from Lord..

867
00:52:20,083 --> 00:52:22,415
...that destiny has
to complete a full circle.

868
00:52:22,852 --> 00:52:27,756
And until it's not complete,
it will keep tormenting you.

869
00:52:27,924 --> 00:52:32,885
That 300 year old threat..has
now turned into a catastrophe.

870
00:52:34,330 --> 00:52:36,731
Guru, what's the solution?

871
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:39,064
You mean there's no way.

872
00:52:39,769 --> 00:52:40,793
There is.

873
00:52:42,038 --> 00:52:46,236
There is one way..which
can take you to your destiny.

874
00:52:46,909 --> 00:52:48,343
The way of Leela.

875
00:52:48,911 --> 00:52:51,278
Your story is connected with Leela.

876
00:52:51,647 --> 00:52:53,809
So using Leela as base.

877
00:52:55,184 --> 00:52:58,347
...l'll try to show
you the story of Leela.

878
00:53:08,831 --> 00:53:14,235
O Lord..today I am going against
the norms of 'Nadi-Shashtra'.

879
00:53:16,606 --> 00:53:18,973
Only to help this boy.

880
00:53:21,210 --> 00:53:23,474
Forgive me, Lord.

881
00:53:25,214 --> 00:53:26,773
Forgive me.

882
00:53:37,727 --> 00:53:45,157
'Sanskrit chants'

883
00:53:46,869 --> 00:53:52,205
'Sanskrit chants'

884
00:54:42,692 --> 00:54:43,818
Don't move, boy.

885
00:54:43,893 --> 00:54:45,224
Or I'll stab you right now.

886
00:54:47,096 --> 00:54:49,861
What are you looking at, my tormentor.

887
00:54:50,866 --> 00:54:55,565
You'll have to pay the price
of looking at Leela with your life.

888
00:54:57,974 --> 00:54:59,874
I will behead you.

889
00:55:00,209 --> 00:55:02,610
My head's always
bowed before you, Leela.

890
00:55:03,613 --> 00:55:08,210
Behead me, or don't. I don't care.

891
00:55:10,086 --> 00:55:11,576
That's my only regret.

892
00:55:11,654 --> 00:55:13,179
You never stop me.

893
00:55:13,256 --> 00:55:15,691
You don't care for me.

894
00:55:17,860 --> 00:55:20,329
Stupid girl, aren't you ashamed.

895
00:55:20,663 --> 00:55:24,031
Those who feel ashamed,
curse their fate.

896
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:27,602
If I had felt ashamed,
I wouldn't have fallen in love.

897
00:55:27,670 --> 00:55:32,540
And since I'm in love,
there's bound to be fire.

898
00:55:32,875 --> 00:55:35,674
Take my hand, marry me.

899
00:55:38,714 --> 00:55:39,545
No, Leela.

900
00:55:44,887 --> 00:55:45,718
Shravan.

901
00:55:46,922 --> 00:55:49,914
I don't even have a
small home to offer you.

902
00:55:53,029 --> 00:55:58,331
I feel..that my poverty
might ruin all your desires.

903
00:56:01,003 --> 00:56:02,994
Your hean is my home.

904
00:56:04,373 --> 00:56:06,364
You're my king. My king.

905
00:56:08,911 --> 00:56:11,141
According to our customs.

906
00:56:11,380 --> 00:56:13,314
...Lord Vishwakarma will
be worshiped two days later.

907
00:56:13,382 --> 00:56:17,717
And this time, famous sculptor Mr. Bhairao
will also attend the veneration.

908
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:22,517
Glory to Mr. Bhairao!

909
00:56:22,725 --> 00:56:25,854
Glory to Mr. Bhairao!

910
00:56:43,679 --> 00:56:48,412
"My wrists jingle..like
the golden bangles."

911
00:56:50,953 --> 00:56:55,948
"As I stretchedmy counyard echoed."

912
00:56:57,893 --> 00:57:01,329
"My fragrance makes
the flowers blossom."

913
00:57:01,731 --> 00:57:05,190
"The moon shines its
moonlight in my lane."

914
00:57:05,735 --> 00:57:11,902
"My anklets are tinkling
and conveying."

915
00:57:11,974 --> 00:57:19,244
"O drummer, your drums.."

916
00:57:19,315 --> 00:57:26,688
"O drummer, your drums are thumping,"

917
00:57:26,756 --> 00:57:30,021
"The drums are thumping."

918
00:57:30,359 --> 00:57:37,823
"O drummer, your drums are thumping,"

919
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:41,837
"The drums are thumping."

920
00:57:46,275 --> 00:57:49,267
Glory to Mr. Bhairao!

921
00:58:12,401 --> 00:58:16,099
"L've adorned my eyes with Kohl."

922
00:58:16,172 --> 00:58:19,472
"l've laced my tresses with flowers."

923
00:58:23,446 --> 00:58:27,178
"l've adorned my eyes with Kohl."

924
00:58:27,249 --> 00:58:30,082
"l've laced my tresses with flowers."

925
00:58:30,152 --> 00:58:33,782
"The dot on my forehead claims."

926
00:58:33,856 --> 00:58:37,053
"..l've stolen my own slumber."

927
00:58:38,027 --> 00:58:44,194
"My anklets are tinkling
and conveying."

928
00:58:44,266 --> 00:58:51,468
"O drummer, your drums are thumping,"

929
00:58:51,540 --> 00:58:55,204
"The drums are thumping."

930
00:58:55,277 --> 00:59:02,479
"O drummer, your drums are thumping,"

931
00:59:02,551 --> 00:59:07,318
"The drums are thumping."

932
00:59:19,602 --> 00:59:26,201
"O drummer, your drums are thumping,"

933
00:59:26,275 --> 00:59:29,438
"The drums are thumping."

934
00:59:29,512 --> 00:59:32,846
"The drums are thumping."

935
00:59:32,915 --> 00:59:37,079
"The drums are thumping."

936
00:59:41,924 --> 00:59:44,154
Give it here.

937
00:59:44,527 --> 00:59:46,393
Hit it like this.

938
00:59:49,565 --> 00:59:51,090
Here. - Okay, Bhairo sir.

939
01:00:00,843 --> 01:00:01,901
Look, Bhairo sir.

940
01:00:02,144 --> 01:00:03,339
I made an effon.

941
01:00:05,915 --> 01:00:06,780
Beautiful.

942
01:00:07,917 --> 01:00:09,009
Very beautiful.

943
01:00:10,886 --> 01:00:12,752
But it lacks inspiration.

944
01:00:14,290 --> 01:00:16,349
And all efforts are
vain without inspiration.

945
01:00:19,161 --> 01:00:20,890
That girl at the veneration yesterday.

946
01:00:22,097 --> 01:00:23,087
Leela?

947
01:00:23,766 --> 01:00:24,324
She's a camel.

948
01:00:24,567 --> 01:00:26,262
Jumping around in the desen all day.

949
01:00:26,335 --> 01:00:27,666
Nothing more.

950
01:00:28,270 --> 01:00:29,066
Leela.

951
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:32,269
Bring her here.

952
01:00:33,676 --> 01:00:35,144
I will make a statue of her.

953
01:00:36,278 --> 01:00:38,975
Bhairo sir,
you..will make Leela's statue.

954
01:00:40,182 --> 01:00:42,082
It's been so long since
you last made a statue.

955
01:00:43,052 --> 01:00:45,578
You even refused our queen.

956
01:00:45,654 --> 01:00:48,589
And Leela.. - Like I said.

957
01:00:49,725 --> 01:00:53,320
To make a statue..one
needs inspiration.

958
01:00:54,797 --> 01:00:56,196
Go. - I get it.

959
01:00:56,899 --> 01:00:57,923
I'll go call her.

960
01:01:01,036 --> 01:01:03,334
Leela. - Shravan.

961
01:01:03,706 --> 01:01:05,105
You didn't go to Bhairo
sir's place today,

962
01:01:05,174 --> 01:01:06,335
That's where I am coming from.

963
01:01:06,642 --> 01:01:08,076
And look what I made.

964
01:01:08,243 --> 01:01:09,108
Statue.

965
01:01:09,645 --> 01:01:11,807
Even Bhairo sir praised me.

966
01:01:12,648 --> 01:01:16,414
Soon you'll be a renowned
sculptor like Bhairo.

967
01:01:16,752 --> 01:01:20,279
If I can be half of what he is,
I can stan making some money.

968
01:01:20,923 --> 01:01:22,857
Then I'll marry you
and bring you home.

969
01:01:23,325 --> 01:01:25,054
And provide you with a square meal.

970
01:01:25,661 --> 01:01:27,095
But listen. - Yes.

971
01:01:27,162 --> 01:01:30,962
Bhairo sir wants to make
a statue of you. - What?

972
01:01:31,100 --> 01:01:33,626
Bhairo sir wants
to make a statue of you.

973
01:01:34,003 --> 01:01:35,630
I don't want to get any statue made.

974
01:01:35,704 --> 01:01:37,229
Give it to me. - Here, uncle.

975
01:01:37,706 --> 01:01:39,401
Leela, don't be a fool.

976
01:01:40,009 --> 01:01:42,205
You know what a famous
sculptor Bhairo sir is.

977
01:01:42,411 --> 01:01:44,072
And if someone makes
a statue of you in Rajasthan.

978
01:01:44,146 --> 01:01:45,910
...it will create a stir all over.

979
01:01:46,348 --> 01:01:47,941
I understand all that.

980
01:01:48,651 --> 01:01:50,312
Go tell Bhairo.

981
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:53,814
My name's Leela. Leela.

982
01:01:54,923 --> 01:01:56,413
Leela, you don't understand.

983
01:01:56,825 --> 01:01:58,350
Destiny's trying to make you famous.

984
01:01:58,427 --> 01:01:59,952
...and you're refusing.

985
01:02:00,095 --> 01:02:01,654
Bhairo sir is a nice man.

986
01:02:02,231 --> 01:02:04,393
And..l'll be there too.

987
01:02:05,434 --> 01:02:10,270
Okay, since you're insisting so much,
then okay.

988
01:02:11,073 --> 01:02:15,237
Come on, make my statue.
- That's more like it.

989
01:02:15,678 --> 01:02:18,375
Then let's go meet
Bhairo sir tomorrow.

990
01:02:18,781 --> 01:02:19,339
Fine.

991
01:02:20,883 --> 01:02:23,375
Now you come with me. - Where?

992
01:02:24,086 --> 01:02:25,178
Leela.

993
01:03:49,139 --> 01:03:49,731
I am right here.

994
01:03:51,875 --> 01:03:54,003
I'll be there with you.

995
01:03:56,813 --> 01:03:57,905
Bhairo sir..Leela.

996
01:04:01,084 --> 01:04:02,984
An angel in human form.

997
01:04:06,289 --> 01:04:08,917
You're more beautiful
than my imagination.

998
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:12,091
Bhairo isn't God.

999
01:04:14,164 --> 01:04:17,691
But I'll sculpt a statue of you..

1000
01:04:19,469 --> 01:04:22,336
"Which will make
you immortal in history.

1001
01:04:24,174 --> 01:04:25,369
Come with me.

1002
01:04:26,242 --> 01:04:27,175
Come on.

1003
01:04:34,984 --> 01:04:36,179
What is this place?

1004
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:38,719
This is Bhairo sir's chamber.

1005
01:04:40,690 --> 01:04:42,818
Even I got to see this place,
only because of you.

1006
01:04:44,494 --> 01:04:47,691
And you know,
Bhairo sir made this entire chamber.

1007
01:04:47,764 --> 01:04:50,699
...from sand and jute.

1008
01:04:53,937 --> 01:04:55,063
Come.

1009
01:05:07,650 --> 01:05:08,674
Come. - Go on.

1010
01:05:08,785 --> 01:05:09,946
Come on. - I said go.

1011
01:05:17,927 --> 01:05:19,622
Go, sit.

1012
01:05:35,745 --> 01:05:36,837
Sit.

1013
01:05:41,584 --> 01:05:43,109
Bhairo sir, that's your seat.

1014
01:05:45,121 --> 01:05:47,055
From today it belongs
to my inspiration.

1015
01:05:47,257 --> 01:05:51,160
Shravan, I will carve
Leela's statue in a sandstone.

1016
01:05:51,327 --> 01:05:53,261
But sir, that's a rare stone.

1017
01:05:53,763 --> 01:05:54,855
And hard too.

1018
01:05:55,598 --> 01:05:58,192
Leela's statue will be unique.

1019
01:06:00,970 --> 01:06:03,166
I want solitude to make this statue.

1020
01:06:03,773 --> 01:06:04,569
Yes, Bhairo sir.

1021
01:06:04,741 --> 01:06:07,039
And until this statue isn't ready..

1022
01:06:07,844 --> 01:06:11,838
...you'll be my chief assistant,
and tutor all the other students.

1023
01:06:12,315 --> 01:06:13,646
Yes, Bhairo sir.

1024
01:06:14,183 --> 01:06:15,981
May Lord Vishwakarma bless you.

1025
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:20,712
I'll start sculpting the statue today.

1026
01:06:21,291 --> 01:06:22,349
Wait.

1027
01:06:32,035 --> 01:06:33,059
Chief assistant.

1028
01:06:34,304 --> 01:06:36,204
You said you'll stay with me.

1029
01:06:36,706 --> 01:06:39,300
Leela..l'll go crazy.

1030
01:06:39,442 --> 01:06:41,069
You don't know what's
happening with me.

1031
01:06:41,945 --> 01:06:42,810
Let me go.

1032
01:06:43,313 --> 01:06:44,212
What do I understand?

1033
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:45,247
Stupid girl.

1034
01:06:45,682 --> 01:06:47,377
Firstly Bhairo sir
is making your statue.

1035
01:06:47,750 --> 01:06:50,276
And he also made
me his chief assistant.

1036
01:06:50,353 --> 01:06:51,218
Understand?

1037
01:06:51,387 --> 01:06:54,015
That means you won't be here with me?

1038
01:06:54,290 --> 01:06:57,157
Leela..you don't understand
what will happen.

1039
01:06:57,460 --> 01:06:58,825
...if I become the chief assistant.

1040
01:06:58,895 --> 01:07:01,865
Then no one can stop
us from getting married.

1041
01:07:03,399 --> 01:07:04,924
Marriage? - Yes.

1042
01:07:05,101 --> 01:07:07,035
And don't worry, I'm right here.

1043
01:07:07,904 --> 01:07:10,032
And Bhairo sir needs
solitude to make the statue.

1044
01:07:10,473 --> 01:07:11,702
Understand.

1045
01:07:12,308 --> 01:07:13,969
Come on now, go and sit.

1046
01:07:14,143 --> 01:07:15,804
Go. Go on.

1047
01:07:16,012 --> 01:07:18,106
And listen..return on time.

1048
01:07:39,302 --> 01:07:42,033
There is no human being or animal.

1049
01:07:43,706 --> 01:07:47,404
No God..or the devil.

1050
01:07:48,845 --> 01:07:50,506
There's no Bhairo..

1051
01:07:52,448 --> 01:07:53,506
...or Leela!

1052
01:07:55,118 --> 01:07:56,847
Just an anist.

1053
01:07:58,521 --> 01:08:00,182
...and his inspiration.

1054
01:08:00,723 --> 01:08:03,215
Until they don't become one..

1055
01:08:03,559 --> 01:08:07,496
"Their Dream's won't become on.

1056
01:08:10,366 --> 01:08:12,232
An desires sacrifice.

1057
01:08:13,603 --> 01:08:16,834
Surrender yourself to me.

1058
01:08:18,241 --> 01:08:22,542
Because history was always
created from total surrender.

1059
01:08:23,246 --> 01:08:27,706
'Then no one can stop
us from getting married.'

1060
01:08:31,721 --> 01:08:41,722
"My fair beloved..

1061
01:08:42,498 --> 01:08:49,370
...welcome to my country."

1062
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:53,810
"My nights are restless."

1063
01:08:53,876 --> 01:08:58,211
"The days torment me as well."

1064
01:08:58,281 --> 01:09:02,514
"Come back to me..beloved."

1065
01:09:02,585 --> 01:09:08,456
"Without you..my heart's restless."

1066
01:09:08,524 --> 01:09:10,788
"Without you.."

1067
01:09:11,627 --> 01:09:14,392
"Come back to me, beloved."

1068
01:09:14,464 --> 01:09:20,267
"Without you..my heart's restless."

1069
01:09:20,436 --> 01:09:23,303
"Without you.."

1070
01:09:33,416 --> 01:09:39,321
"The weathers are not the same."

1071
01:09:39,455 --> 01:09:44,825
"Even the rains feel different."

1072
01:09:49,632 --> 01:09:53,296
Beautiful looks..and
an amazing voice too.

1073
01:09:53,836 --> 01:09:55,201
You sing well.

1074
01:09:56,939 --> 01:09:59,772
Here. Wear these clothes.

1075
01:10:16,259 --> 01:10:17,351
Sing.

1076
01:10:21,197 --> 01:10:26,692
"The weathers are not the same."

1077
01:10:27,170 --> 01:10:32,506
"Even the rains feel different."

1078
01:10:32,942 --> 01:10:38,881
"The weathers are not the same."

1079
01:10:38,948 --> 01:10:43,715
"Even the rains feel different."

1080
01:10:43,786 --> 01:10:50,658
"Like the dried river..

1081
01:10:50,726 --> 01:10:55,357
...my destiny calls
out to you beloved."

1082
01:10:55,431 --> 01:11:01,427
"Without you..my heart's restless."

1083
01:11:01,504 --> 01:11:04,166
"Without you.."

1084
01:11:04,373 --> 01:11:07,172
"Come back to me, beloved."

1085
01:11:07,243 --> 01:11:12,977
"Without you..my heart's restless."

1086
01:11:13,216 --> 01:11:15,810
"Without you.."

1087
01:11:16,352 --> 01:11:18,878
"Without you..my heart's restless."

1088
01:11:19,322 --> 01:11:21,848
"Beloved.."

1089
01:11:22,291 --> 01:11:27,627
"Come back to me, beloved."

1090
01:11:28,431 --> 01:11:32,800
"Come back to me, beloved."

1091
01:11:34,337 --> 01:11:40,572
"Come back to me, beloved."

1092
01:11:45,815 --> 01:11:51,686
"Without you..my heart's restless."

1093
01:11:51,754 --> 01:11:56,590
"Come back to me, beloved."

1094
01:11:57,660 --> 01:12:02,723
"Come back to me, beloved."

1095
01:12:03,833 --> 01:12:10,398
"Come back to me, beloved."

1096
01:12:12,441 --> 01:12:13,806
What happened, Bhairo sir?

1097
01:12:17,980 --> 01:12:19,277
Be patient.

1098
01:12:26,022 --> 01:12:27,751
Bhairo said, be patient.

1099
01:12:28,491 --> 01:12:34,919
No, Bhairo didn't tell her that,
it was the Destiny.

1100
01:12:36,866 --> 01:12:38,834
And this wait will be over..

1101
01:12:39,468 --> 01:12:43,666
...at the same place where
this story was left incomplete.

1102
01:12:43,906 --> 01:12:45,897
Whether you want it or not.

1103
01:12:47,443 --> 01:12:49,537
But destiny will take
you to the same place.

1104
01:12:49,879 --> 01:12:53,838
...where you'll be at
a similar twist of the story.

1105
01:12:54,016 --> 01:12:57,543
And the decision you take now..

1106
01:12:57,720 --> 01:12:59,620
...will decide your fate.

1107
01:13:00,856 --> 01:13:04,850
But getting to that twist,
won't be easy.

1108
01:13:05,728 --> 01:13:09,062
There will be many
obstructions on this path.

1109
01:13:09,365 --> 01:13:10,730
"Which will be a
matter of life and death.

1110
01:13:12,868 --> 01:13:17,362
Either they'll take your life,
or give their life.

1111
01:13:31,154 --> 01:13:34,749
King Harshvardhan staned
this Polo Tournament.

1112
01:13:35,225 --> 01:13:41,130
And since then, every year this
tournament is organized in his honor.

1113
01:13:41,197 --> 01:13:44,326
Doesn't your Prince play Polo? - No.

1114
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:48,166
He likes watching, not playing.

1115
01:13:48,371 --> 01:13:52,239
Actually the prince
has no greed for the trophy.

1116
01:13:52,408 --> 01:13:54,342
That reminds me, we're hungry.

1117
01:13:54,611 --> 01:13:56,511
Can we eat? - Yes, of course.

1118
01:13:56,579 --> 01:13:57,569
I am hungry too.

1119
01:13:57,647 --> 01:13:58,910
You speak so much,
and don't listen at all.

1120
01:13:59,182 --> 01:14:00,809
I'll show you where
dinner's been served.

1121
01:14:00,884 --> 01:14:02,716
Come, follow me.

1122
01:14:03,286 --> 01:14:06,483
Let's go eat. - No, you guys go ahead.

1123
01:14:06,623 --> 01:14:07,749
I'll wait for Ranveer.

1124
01:14:08,124 --> 01:14:09,353
Okay, I'll get you a drink.

1125
01:14:10,160 --> 01:14:11,150
Come, Rads.

1126
01:14:11,461 --> 01:14:12,553
See you. - Bye.

1127
01:14:20,203 --> 01:14:21,466
Congrats.

1128
01:14:22,505 --> 01:14:22,937
Thank you.

1129
01:14:23,173 --> 01:14:25,437
Vikram sir, you won the match again.

1130
01:14:25,675 --> 01:14:26,642
Congrats.

1131
01:14:26,743 --> 01:14:29,405
Vikram's born to be a winner.

1132
01:14:30,346 --> 01:14:35,443
And there's no victory in this world,
that won't bow before Vikram.

1133
01:14:39,455 --> 01:14:40,752
No, thank you.

1134
01:14:43,259 --> 01:14:47,662
Where did this butterfly
come from in this desert?

1135
01:14:56,906 --> 01:14:59,273
Hello, beautiful.

1136
01:15:00,577 --> 01:15:02,671
Hi. Congratulations, Mr. Vikram.

1137
01:15:02,979 --> 01:15:07,917
First time it felt
so amazing hearing my name.

1138
01:15:08,852 --> 01:15:14,655
You congratulated me,
my efforts didn't go in vain.

1139
01:15:15,291 --> 01:15:17,555
You play really well.

1140
01:15:18,695 --> 01:15:22,290
That's the only think I
learned to do best, Baby Doll.

1141
01:15:25,468 --> 01:15:29,462
Whether it's someone
honor..or the Polo ball.

1142
01:15:29,906 --> 01:15:34,605
By the way, where are you from?
- London.

1143
01:15:34,744 --> 01:15:39,978
Wow! This is my first close
encounter with a dame from London.

1144
01:15:41,284 --> 01:15:44,254
Otherwise,
I only see them on the internet.

1145
01:15:46,422 --> 01:15:51,258
I'm sure every pan of
your body must be fair, right?

1146
01:15:52,028 --> 01:15:55,589
Whether every pan of
the body is fair or not.

1147
01:15:56,232 --> 01:15:57,563
"But the heart.

1148
01:15:58,935 --> 01:15:59,959
...should be.

1149
01:16:04,674 --> 01:16:05,664
Madam.

1150
01:16:06,876 --> 01:16:12,007
Why don't you come to my
manor one evening, for dinner?

1151
01:16:12,782 --> 01:16:15,808
You'll love the food.

1152
01:16:16,853 --> 01:16:20,380
I swear,
we'll leave only after breakfast.

1153
01:16:21,691 --> 01:16:23,455
Ranveer, you?

1154
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:30,431
I was wondering only a
Rajput could stop Vikram's hand.

1155
01:16:31,367 --> 01:16:34,997
Don't you see,
I am busy at the moment.

1156
01:16:35,505 --> 01:16:37,371
We'll talk later.

1157
01:16:37,540 --> 01:16:39,872
Brother Vikram, behave yourself.

1158
01:16:40,643 --> 01:16:42,372
Meera is a guest.

1159
01:16:42,845 --> 01:16:46,008
I am not humiliating her.

1160
01:16:47,383 --> 01:16:50,353
I am only inviting
her over for dinner.

1161
01:16:50,720 --> 01:16:54,315
There are cenain manners to invite
someone for dinner, brother Vikram.

1162
01:16:55,325 --> 01:16:57,589
Vikram has his own ways.

1163
01:16:58,461 --> 01:17:01,055
He doesn't need to learn from anyone.

1164
01:17:01,864 --> 01:17:05,494
Wild animals never
learn any1hing, brother.

1165
01:17:05,668 --> 01:17:08,399
Ranveer.. - And they die like a dog.

1166
01:17:08,604 --> 01:17:09,901
Please.. - No, Vikram.

1167
01:17:10,006 --> 01:17:11,496
Don'tstar1 an argument here.

1168
01:17:11,908 --> 01:17:14,707
Or else it will affect the case.

1169
01:17:14,844 --> 01:17:18,405
Calm down. - Come. Come.

1170
01:17:18,614 --> 01:17:19,479
Come away.

1171
01:17:19,615 --> 01:17:23,108
Bajje..open the champagne.

1172
01:17:23,553 --> 01:17:25,749
I've been victorious today.

1173
01:17:32,729 --> 01:17:34,060
What are you thinking?

1174
01:17:34,364 --> 01:17:35,957
There's such a huge difference
between you and Vikram.

1175
01:17:37,033 --> 01:17:38,831
Doesn't seem like
you two are brothers.

1176
01:17:39,502 --> 01:17:42,995
Meera..Vikram was a bit
spoilt from the beginning.

1177
01:17:43,406 --> 01:17:48,401
After uncle and aunt's death,
he crossed all limits.

1178
01:17:48,578 --> 01:17:49,943
I am sorry.

1179
01:17:50,646 --> 01:17:53,411
But even you lost your parents
when you were quite young.

1180
01:17:53,750 --> 01:17:55,548
And you're a Rajput too.

1181
01:17:55,718 --> 01:17:59,985
But Vikram and you..are
completely different.

1182
01:18:00,523 --> 01:18:01,820
It's the difference in our thoughts.

1183
01:18:02,925 --> 01:18:05,019
For him, respect is
something to be taken.

1184
01:18:06,062 --> 01:18:07,826
...and I believe it should be given.

1185
01:18:08,031 --> 01:18:09,499
He feels proud in
displaying his strength.

1186
01:18:09,565 --> 01:18:10,999
...while I like being sober.

1187
01:18:14,637 --> 01:18:19,973
I know, because you believe
in love and affection.

1188
01:18:22,879 --> 01:18:24,369
I always believed in love..

1189
01:18:25,715 --> 01:18:27,979
"But now I've an unwavering faith.

1190
01:18:29,085 --> 01:18:30,883
Meaning. I didn't get it?

1191
01:18:33,689 --> 01:18:37,455
Look, Meera..l don't
like Misting words.

1192
01:18:44,901 --> 01:18:45,697
Will you marry me?

1193
01:18:45,835 --> 01:18:54,937
"When the Lord sees you with me."

1194
01:18:58,781 --> 01:19:01,512
The Lord kept my hands empty..

1195
01:19:02,418 --> 01:19:03,544
...SO..

1196
01:19:05,021 --> 01:19:05,920
...he could give me something better.

1197
01:19:06,055 --> 01:19:09,457
"He must be wondering.."

1198
01:19:09,559 --> 01:19:15,521
"..how could He give
me such a valuable thing."

1199
01:20:24,233 --> 01:20:28,693
"Your beloveds courtyard."

1200
01:20:28,804 --> 01:20:33,139
"You're now his queen.
Your beloved's courtyard."

1201
01:20:33,209 --> 01:20:37,612
"Your beloveds courtyard."

1202
01:20:37,747 --> 01:20:42,150
"You're now his queen.
Your beloved's courtyard."

1203
01:20:42,218 --> 01:20:46,621
"Your beloveds courtyard."

1204
01:20:46,822 --> 01:20:51,020
"You're now his queen.
Your beloved's courtyard."

1205
01:21:03,573 --> 01:21:05,735
"He's the most handsome and dashing."

1206
01:21:05,808 --> 01:21:08,004
"He took my heart."

1207
01:21:08,077 --> 01:21:12,310
"He stole my slumber..and
gave me dreams."

1208
01:21:21,591 --> 01:21:23,685
"He's the most handsome and dashing."

1209
01:21:23,759 --> 01:21:25,887
"He took my heart."

1210
01:21:25,962 --> 01:21:29,956
"He stole my slumber..and
gave me dreams."

1211
01:21:30,032 --> 01:21:34,299
"Now my eyes..keep saying.."

1212
01:21:34,604 --> 01:21:39,166
"No matter how much one
stops me..l will love him."

1213
01:21:39,242 --> 01:21:41,609
"My beloveds a superstar."

1214
01:21:41,677 --> 01:21:43,771
"My beloveds a superstar."

1215
01:21:43,846 --> 01:21:45,871
"l am a big fan of him."

1216
01:21:45,948 --> 01:21:48,144
"My beloveds a superstar."

1217
01:21:48,217 --> 01:21:50,242
"My beloveds a superstar."

1218
01:21:50,386 --> 01:21:52,718
"My beloveds a superstar."

1219
01:21:52,788 --> 01:21:54,882
"l am a big fan of him."

1220
01:21:54,957 --> 01:21:57,187
"My beloveds a superstar."

1221
01:22:25,221 --> 01:22:29,556
"Last night when he proposed
to me in a filmy style."

1222
01:22:29,625 --> 01:22:33,687
"l didn't look left or right,
just gave him my heart."

1223
01:22:33,796 --> 01:22:35,560
"Rumors spread everywhere."

1224
01:22:35,631 --> 01:22:37,793
"And photos were
published in the papers."

1225
01:22:37,867 --> 01:22:42,532
"l don't care..l'm with a star."

1226
01:22:42,672 --> 01:22:47,234
"My beloveds a superstar."

1227
01:22:47,310 --> 01:22:49,335
"l am a big fan of him."

1228
01:22:49,412 --> 01:22:51,676
"My beloveds a superstar."

1229
01:23:04,660 --> 01:23:05,718
Thanks, Rads.

1230
01:23:06,062 --> 01:23:07,621
You brought me to India.

1231
01:23:08,531 --> 01:23:14,664
And because of you,
I found a life-partner like Ranveer.

1232
01:23:14,970 --> 01:23:17,667
No, Meera, it was your destiny.

1233
01:23:18,474 --> 01:23:22,468
I hope there are no
more sorrows in your life.

1234
01:23:23,079 --> 01:23:25,309
You keep smiling all the time.

1235
01:23:25,481 --> 01:23:28,678
And problems stay miles away.

1236
01:23:30,453 --> 01:23:31,079
Thank you.

1237
01:23:32,288 --> 01:23:33,847
You know, I am going back today.

1238
01:23:34,590 --> 01:23:36,922
Oh, you giving back.

1239
01:23:36,992 --> 01:23:39,927
No, it's going back. - Okay.

1240
01:23:40,496 --> 01:23:44,455
So you want to know
what's in this box. - Yes.

1241
01:23:44,734 --> 01:23:46,532
So open it. - What?

1242
01:23:47,470 --> 01:23:48,995
The box?

1243
01:23:54,477 --> 01:23:58,607
Lollipop? - I've got diabetes.

1244
01:23:58,781 --> 01:24:01,614
And no one lets me eat sweets.

1245
01:24:01,784 --> 01:24:05,687
S0..l Side it. - Hide it?

1246
01:24:05,821 --> 01:24:06,845
Yes exactly.

1247
01:24:11,660 --> 01:24:14,322
Suck on this, you'll love it.

1248
01:24:15,765 --> 01:24:18,063
Rads, we're getting late. Come on.

1249
01:24:18,634 --> 01:24:20,068
Disgusting!

1250
01:24:21,837 --> 01:24:25,102
He's behaving like he
never sucked on one of these.

1251
01:24:41,991 --> 01:24:42,958
What's this, brother Vikram?

1252
01:24:43,025 --> 01:24:45,790
What were you doing
for 25 years in London?

1253
01:24:46,462 --> 01:24:48,089
Can't you read?

1254
01:24:49,064 --> 01:24:50,828
It's a stay-order from the coun.

1255
01:24:51,100 --> 01:24:52,932
Can I ask the meaning of this?

1256
01:24:53,102 --> 01:24:54,536
Look, Ranveer.

1257
01:24:55,137 --> 01:24:57,504
Bhairo Viraj doesn't
only belong to you.

1258
01:24:58,407 --> 01:25:00,102
I've a right to it too.

1259
01:25:00,643 --> 01:25:02,509
You'll make decisions on your own..

1260
01:25:02,845 --> 01:25:05,041
...and turn it over to the government.

1261
01:25:05,681 --> 01:25:08,707
And expect me to watch quietly.

1262
01:25:09,885 --> 01:25:11,114
Look, brother Vikram.

1263
01:25:11,420 --> 01:25:13,946
Its best to handover Bhairo
Viraj to the archeological depanment.

1264
01:25:15,024 --> 01:25:16,992
Otherwise this heritage
will be reduced to dust.

1265
01:25:17,426 --> 01:25:18,416
Then so be it.

1266
01:25:18,727 --> 01:25:19,990
It belongs to me.

1267
01:25:20,429 --> 01:25:22,022
If you act stubborn like uncle..

1268
01:25:23,399 --> 01:25:25,925
"Then you too will
be ruined just like him.

1269
01:25:26,535 --> 01:25:28,833
We've been fighting
this case for 25 years.

1270
01:25:29,205 --> 01:25:30,866
What did you and uncle gain from it?

1271
01:25:31,106 --> 01:25:32,835
Even your manor is mongaged.

1272
01:25:34,477 --> 01:25:35,842
Take your stay order back.

1273
01:25:35,911 --> 01:25:37,879
And I'll split the
compensation money with you.

1274
01:25:39,582 --> 01:25:42,813
I never even took
half-day from school.

1275
01:25:43,519 --> 01:25:45,453
How can I accept half compensation?

1276
01:25:46,856 --> 01:25:49,484
Bhairo Viraj will solely be mine.

1277
01:25:49,725 --> 01:25:51,557
Or it will be no one's.

1278
01:25:51,794 --> 01:25:53,159
That's not possible, brother.

1279
01:25:54,530 --> 01:25:59,934
Ranveer Singh, let's settle this
matter calmly, while we still can.

1280
01:26:01,904 --> 01:26:05,033
Otherwise..the Rajpufs
have a history.

1281
01:26:05,774 --> 01:26:12,146
...of solving matter of land,
women and money by using might.

1282
01:26:14,083 --> 01:26:17,576
Those who are scared of the present,
talk about the past.

1283
01:26:19,021 --> 01:26:20,819
Rajpufs don't turn pages of history.

1284
01:26:20,890 --> 01:26:21,982
"They change time.

1285
01:26:22,157 --> 01:26:27,061
Fine, we'll decide
when I'm holding a gun.

1286
01:26:30,833 --> 01:26:34,201
Don't try to scare me, brother.

1287
01:26:34,570 --> 01:26:38,029
No bullet has the strength
to pierce Ranveer Singh's body.

1288
01:26:39,208 --> 01:26:40,505
And as far as your stay order goes.

1289
01:26:40,576 --> 01:26:41,975
...l'll get it cancelled in a month.

1290
01:26:42,745 --> 01:26:46,272
Ranveer Singh,you might have..

1291
01:26:46,615 --> 01:26:50,574
...to pay dearly for this.

1292
01:26:51,153 --> 01:26:53,087
I will pay whatever the price is,
brother.

1293
01:26:53,589 --> 01:26:55,785
You and uncle think
about paying your dues.

1294
01:26:58,928 --> 01:27:02,023
Vikram, if Ranveer Singh's
willing to pay few millions.

1295
01:27:02,097 --> 01:27:03,587
...give Bhairo Virajna to him.

1296
01:27:03,766 --> 01:27:06,098
At least you can repay some
of your dues. - Brother Samar.

1297
01:27:08,537 --> 01:27:10,232
I am not a beggar.

1298
01:27:14,143 --> 01:27:18,011
My father spent all his
life in finding this statue.

1299
01:27:19,715 --> 01:27:21,240
I Will find it.

1300
01:27:22,184 --> 01:27:26,018
And it'll get me at least a billion.

1301
01:28:44,700 --> 01:28:45,826
Petrol prices have increased.

1302
01:28:45,901 --> 01:28:46,993
Good days haven't arrived yet.

1303
01:28:47,069 --> 01:28:49,333
Go find another car. - Okay.

1304
01:28:49,405 --> 01:28:50,702
600..

1305
01:28:50,973 --> 01:28:52,873
Brother, come here.

1306
01:28:53,342 --> 01:28:54,707
Will you take me to Bhairo Virajna?

1307
01:28:54,843 --> 01:28:56,675
Why walk? It's so hot.

1308
01:28:56,745 --> 01:28:57,371
I have a car.

1309
01:28:57,746 --> 01:28:59,214
1000 for A/C, 700 for normal.

1310
01:28:59,281 --> 01:29:00,407
If you like it, take a seat.

1311
01:29:00,883 --> 01:29:01,406
Let's go.

1312
01:29:01,650 --> 01:29:04,347
Come. - But..you do
know Bhairo Virajna.

1313
01:29:04,420 --> 01:29:06,081
What are you saying?

1314
01:29:06,255 --> 01:29:08,952
There's no place in Rajasthan
that Basant doesn't know.

1315
01:29:09,425 --> 01:29:12,258
Jaipur's Hawa Mahal,
Udaipur Lake, Kota's marble..

1316
01:29:12,327 --> 01:29:13,954
Shall we? - Come on.

1317
01:29:17,966 --> 01:29:21,334
What is Bhairo Virajna?

1318
01:29:21,704 --> 01:29:23,172
'Viral-na' means "Home".

1319
01:29:23,372 --> 01:29:24,635
It's believed that
many hundred years ago..

1320
01:29:24,707 --> 01:29:27,005
...some guy called Bhairo lived there.

1321
01:29:27,342 --> 01:29:30,312
Since then the place
is known by this name.

1322
01:29:30,379 --> 01:29:32,279
Do you have a life insurance?

1323
01:29:33,882 --> 01:29:34,781
What?

1324
01:29:34,917 --> 01:29:39,184
Because once you go in,
you can't come out? - Why?

1325
01:29:39,888 --> 01:29:41,788
Dead bodies don't walk.

1326
01:29:44,326 --> 01:29:48,422
There's a dispute between Prince
Vikram Singh and Ranveer Singh.

1327
01:29:48,997 --> 01:29:51,466
Going there means inviting your death.

1328
01:29:52,134 --> 01:29:53,329
If Ranveer Singh gets hold of you..

1329
01:29:53,402 --> 01:29:54,801
...you can apologies
and save your life.

1330
01:29:55,003 --> 01:29:59,668
But if Vikram Singh gets you,
then..you're dead for sure.

1331
01:30:04,279 --> 01:30:06,475
Brother, here's Bhairo Virajna.

1332
01:30:06,915 --> 01:30:08,974
By the way,
my advice is that you don't go in.

1333
01:30:09,118 --> 01:30:10,176
Goodbye.

1334
01:30:43,152 --> 01:30:44,916
'Angel in the form of human.'

1335
01:30:49,458 --> 01:30:52,155
'What place is this?
- Bhairo sir's chamber.'

1336
01:31:27,663 --> 01:31:29,495
Bhairo!

1337
01:31:43,245 --> 01:31:44,735
Be patient.

1338
01:31:52,621 --> 01:31:56,615
I've heard that Bhairo sir's
going to sculpt his best statue.

1339
01:31:56,725 --> 01:32:00,059
We all know that,
one keeps the statue of Lord..

1340
01:32:00,128 --> 01:32:02,654
...in front of the main entrance.

1341
01:32:02,731 --> 01:32:04,096
Tomorrow is a no-moon night.

1342
01:32:04,733 --> 01:32:06,701
We need to see why Bhairo sir..

1343
01:32:06,768 --> 01:32:09,738
...wants to establish Leela's
statue at his main entrance?

1344
01:32:11,240 --> 01:32:12,036
Leela.

1345
01:32:13,508 --> 01:32:14,202
Come on.

1346
01:32:14,643 --> 01:32:15,974
Leela.. - It'll be fine.

1347
01:32:17,045 --> 01:32:19,912
Look..my statue.

1348
01:32:22,918 --> 01:32:25,717
Leela..the entire village
will see your statue tomorrow.

1349
01:32:25,787 --> 01:32:27,152
They will all be so happy.

1350
01:32:27,623 --> 01:32:29,250
I don't care about the villagers..

1351
01:32:30,559 --> 01:32:31,651
...only you.

1352
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:34,952
Shravan, you wanted
my statue to be sculpted.

1353
01:32:35,964 --> 01:32:40,800
So I want you to see it first.

1354
01:32:42,804 --> 01:32:43,999
I wish that too.

1355
01:32:44,139 --> 01:32:45,664
So, don't suppress your desire.

1356
01:32:45,908 --> 01:32:47,774
Come with me.
- Leela, you don't understand.

1357
01:32:47,843 --> 01:32:48,776
Don't be crazy.

1358
01:32:49,144 --> 01:32:51,340
Leela, Bhairo sir sculpted
that statue himself.

1359
01:32:52,180 --> 01:32:54,342
Don't deprive him of his right.

1360
01:32:54,583 --> 01:32:56,608
But only you have a right on me.

1361
01:32:56,818 --> 01:32:57,842
Only you!

1362
01:33:00,055 --> 01:33:01,614
Come on. - Leela.

1363
01:33:01,857 --> 01:33:03,120
Leela..listen.

1364
01:33:04,760 --> 01:33:05,989
Leela.. - Let go.

1365
01:33:06,161 --> 01:33:08,027
Leela..listen to me.

1366
01:33:08,196 --> 01:33:09,322
Have you gone crazy?

1367
01:33:10,032 --> 01:33:11,727
Leela.. - Let me go.

1368
01:33:12,167 --> 01:33:12,998
Leela.

1369
01:33:18,407 --> 01:33:20,375
Bhairo sir..

1370
01:33:20,842 --> 01:33:22,105
Bhairo sir..l..

1371
01:33:23,078 --> 01:33:27,447
She brought me here.
- Yes, Bhairo sir.

1372
01:33:30,452 --> 01:33:33,114
With these hands I taught to sculpt.

1373
01:33:34,656 --> 01:33:36,784
"But now I'll use them to punish you.

1374
01:33:38,627 --> 01:33:39,423
Shravan.

1375
01:33:40,829 --> 01:33:42,388
Leela belongs to me.

1376
01:33:42,864 --> 01:33:45,561
Her statue, her body..

1377
01:33:46,635 --> 01:33:49,468
...her complexion, beauty, youth, soul.

1378
01:33:49,571 --> 01:33:51,096
They all belong to me.

1379
01:33:52,107 --> 01:33:53,131
Only me.

1380
01:33:54,509 --> 01:33:57,479
How dare you.. - Bhairo!

1381
01:34:01,817 --> 01:34:04,843
How dare you raise
your hands on my Shravan?

1382
01:34:05,587 --> 01:34:07,555
He's my husband!

1383
01:34:08,190 --> 01:34:11,888
I will not spare anyone
who dares to touch him.

1384
01:34:13,862 --> 01:34:16,024
I came here are your inspiration.

1385
01:34:16,698 --> 01:34:19,998
But you thought I was your wife.

1386
01:34:21,837 --> 01:34:23,931
Leela..belongs to Shravan.

1387
01:34:24,172 --> 01:34:25,606
Only Shravan.

1388
01:34:27,776 --> 01:34:29,210
Let's go. Come on.

1389
01:34:32,647 --> 01:34:34,638
Leela.. - Let's go. Come on.

1390
01:34:43,425 --> 01:34:44,893
Shravan. - Leela, move aside.

1391
01:34:47,796 --> 01:34:50,060
No Bhairo. - Move aside.

1392
01:35:25,867 --> 01:35:26,993
Leela!

1393
01:35:32,507 --> 01:35:33,474
Come on.

1394
01:35:34,943 --> 01:35:36,433
Shravan.

1395
01:35:46,354 --> 01:35:48,015
Look. Look.

1396
01:35:48,657 --> 01:35:50,853
I respected you like Goddess.

1397
01:35:51,693 --> 01:35:53,092
Wanted to give you a high place.

1398
01:35:53,161 --> 01:35:56,028
But you..lost all respect in my eyes.

1399
01:35:56,865 --> 01:35:59,960
Your love, made me see
the highest peak of my an.

1400
01:36:00,735 --> 01:36:02,100
But now..

1401
01:36:03,472 --> 01:36:06,066
I'll show you the
depths of my hatred!

1402
01:36:07,109 --> 01:36:08,042
Come on.

1403
01:36:11,146 --> 01:36:12,375
Go!

1404
01:36:30,832 --> 01:36:32,163
Catch him.

1405
01:36:32,934 --> 01:36:34,595
Who are you?

1406
01:36:34,669 --> 01:36:35,932
Let me go.

1407
01:36:39,608 --> 01:36:43,977
Stand up, man. Don't just lie there.

1408
01:36:46,882 --> 01:36:49,249
Who are you? - Karan.

1409
01:36:56,024 --> 01:36:58,959
Lower your eyes while talking to me.

1410
01:36:59,194 --> 01:37:01,060
Or else I'll gouge them out.

1411
01:37:01,296 --> 01:37:02,320
Who are you?

1412
01:37:03,064 --> 01:37:04,327
And what are you doing here?

1413
01:37:05,133 --> 01:37:06,897
I liked the place, so I came in.

1414
01:37:07,135 --> 01:37:12,733
RascaLif you like some girl,
will you barge in her home too?

1415
01:37:14,376 --> 01:37:15,969
What are you doing in Jaisalmer?

1416
01:37:16,077 --> 01:37:20,947
I have a friend. Ranveer Singh.

1417
01:37:22,083 --> 01:37:23,175
Ranveer Singh?

1418
01:37:25,320 --> 01:37:26,810
You're Ranveer Singh's friend.

1419
01:37:26,888 --> 01:37:29,653
You were spying on me? - No, Vikram.

1420
01:37:29,891 --> 01:37:30,983
Don't beat him here.

1421
01:37:31,226 --> 01:37:32,853
Take him to Ranveer Singh's manor.

1422
01:37:33,094 --> 01:37:34,994
Absolutely right, brother Samar.

1423
01:37:35,363 --> 01:37:38,264
And then I'll also get
a glimpse of that London girl.

1424
01:37:38,833 --> 01:37:41,063
Vikram, she's your sister-in-law.

1425
01:37:41,269 --> 01:37:43,795
I don't have any
ill intentions for her.

1426
01:37:43,905 --> 01:37:47,341
All I want is a little
space near her feet.

1427
01:37:48,710 --> 01:37:51,111
I'll show you my hospitality
at your friend's place.

1428
01:37:51,179 --> 01:37:51,941
Come on.

1429
01:37:57,285 --> 01:37:58,616
Ranveer!

1430
01:37:59,187 --> 01:38:00,814
Ranveer Singh!

1431
01:38:03,792 --> 01:38:05,157
What happened, brother Vikram?

1432
01:38:29,050 --> 01:38:31,781
I've a gift for you.

1433
01:38:32,721 --> 01:38:36,658
Your friend was taking
a stroll around Bhairo Virajna.

1434
01:38:37,192 --> 01:38:41,527
Didn't you explain him,
that the place is prohibited?

1435
01:38:42,163 --> 01:38:44,598
One only warns his friends.

1436
01:38:45,066 --> 01:38:47,125
I never saw him before today.

1437
01:38:48,637 --> 01:38:49,695
What?

1438
01:38:51,206 --> 01:38:55,268
He's not your friend?
- No. I don't know him.

1439
01:38:55,877 --> 01:39:00,713
You dare lie to Vikram!
You dare lie to Vikram!

1440
01:39:03,318 --> 01:39:05,753
Bhairo Virajna isn't
your father's property!

1441
01:39:05,920 --> 01:39:08,321
Why did you go to Bhairo Virajna?
- Ranveer, what's going on here?

1442
01:39:08,723 --> 01:39:10,691
Tell me.

1443
01:39:11,226 --> 01:39:13,718
Tell me.

1444
01:39:15,130 --> 01:39:15,926
Tell me.

1445
01:39:15,997 --> 01:39:16,862
Stop it!

1446
01:40:13,521 --> 01:40:15,819
You? - Yes.

1447
01:40:18,193 --> 01:40:19,752
You recognized me?

1448
01:40:20,128 --> 01:40:21,061
Yes.

1449
01:40:23,064 --> 01:40:24,054
Karan, right?

1450
01:40:29,537 --> 01:40:33,098
Ranveer, I thought he's your friend.

1451
01:40:34,209 --> 01:40:37,804
But he turned out
to be your wife's buddy.

1452
01:40:40,548 --> 01:40:41,140
Yes.

1453
01:40:41,950 --> 01:40:44,749
He's my friend Radhika's brother.

1454
01:40:46,588 --> 01:40:47,851
Now you can go.

1455
01:40:48,456 --> 01:40:50,652
See you, sister-in-law.

1456
01:40:53,795 --> 01:40:56,059
You've really lucky!

1457
01:40:57,031 --> 01:40:57,930
Let's go.

1458
01:41:00,602 --> 01:41:01,569
Meera.

1459
01:41:02,170 --> 01:41:03,194
Shall we go in?

1460
01:41:04,839 --> 01:41:05,738
Shall we?

1461
01:41:07,509 --> 01:41:08,635
Come on.

1462
01:41:10,678 --> 01:41:11,474
Let's go.

1463
01:41:18,920 --> 01:41:20,081
Relax.

1464
01:41:22,290 --> 01:41:24,782
How are you feeling now?
- Much better.

1465
01:41:25,660 --> 01:41:27,685
A Rajpufs used you as a punching bag.

1466
01:41:28,096 --> 01:41:29,962
Only Rum can cure this pain.

1467
01:41:31,166 --> 01:41:31,997
Thanks.

1468
01:41:32,901 --> 01:41:34,300
What were you doing in Bhairo Virajna?

1469
01:41:43,344 --> 01:41:45,108
I'm making a music
album on Rajasthani music.

1470
01:41:45,380 --> 01:41:47,815
So I went there looking for something.

1471
01:41:48,116 --> 01:41:50,380
I think you're looking
for something special.

1472
01:41:57,459 --> 01:41:58,449
Excuse me.

1473
01:41:58,893 --> 01:41:59,689
Yes, Mr. Puneet.

1474
01:41:59,761 --> 01:42:01,320
Where are you?
We are waiting for you?

1475
01:42:01,429 --> 01:42:03,090
I'm on my way, sir. - Okay, come.

1476
01:42:03,698 --> 01:42:04,722
0K8'!-

1477
01:42:05,633 --> 01:42:06,725
Excuse me. I've to go.

1478
01:42:06,801 --> 01:42:07,927
I'll see you later.

1479
01:42:13,508 --> 01:42:16,341
Hi, Radhika, Meera here.

1480
01:42:16,411 --> 01:42:17,845
Hi, Meera, how are you?

1481
01:42:17,912 --> 01:42:20,142
I've a good news for you.

1482
01:42:20,748 --> 01:42:22,739
Good news, so soon! Wow!

1483
01:42:22,817 --> 01:42:25,582
Shut up, I didn't mean that.

1484
01:42:25,854 --> 01:42:27,948
So? - Your brother Karan is here.

1485
01:42:28,957 --> 01:42:29,788
Karan?

1486
01:42:30,058 --> 01:42:31,992
Here, talk to her. It's Rads.

1487
01:42:32,093 --> 01:42:32,787
Yeah!

1488
01:42:34,496 --> 01:42:35,486
Hi, Radhika.

1489
01:42:35,830 --> 01:42:37,559
What are you doing in Jaisalmer?

1490
01:42:37,899 --> 01:42:39,128
Fate brought me here.

1491
01:42:39,734 --> 01:42:42,101
Amazing..couldn't
you come a bit earlier.

1492
01:42:42,504 --> 01:42:43,630
Even I would've met you.

1493
01:42:43,805 --> 01:42:45,864
Life had come to
a standstill back then.

1494
01:42:49,410 --> 01:42:50,969
And when it caught up pace.

1495
01:42:51,846 --> 01:42:54,907
...l found myself in front of Meera.

1496
01:42:55,149 --> 01:42:58,551
You're sounding like
a philosopher now.

1497
01:42:59,187 --> 01:43:00,586
I'm a bit confused.

1498
01:43:01,723 --> 01:43:02,952
How did Meera recognize me?

1499
01:43:03,091 --> 01:43:04,081
What do you mean by how?

1500
01:43:04,425 --> 01:43:05,984
She has a very sharp memory.

1501
01:43:06,094 --> 01:43:08,426
I showed her your photo once.

1502
01:43:08,796 --> 01:43:10,127
Karan, now I have to go.

1503
01:43:10,465 --> 01:43:12,433
But if you need any1hing,
feel free to ask Meera.

1504
01:43:12,634 --> 01:43:14,625
Okay? - Yeah, bye.

1505
01:43:14,836 --> 01:43:16,167
Take care, bye.

1506
01:43:18,006 --> 01:43:18,564
Thanks.

1507
01:43:18,673 --> 01:43:19,868
Every1hing okay? - Yeah.

1508
01:43:21,476 --> 01:43:24,935
By the way,
you didn't attend my wedding.

1509
01:43:25,079 --> 01:43:26,478
And now you're suddenly here.

1510
01:43:27,682 --> 01:43:30,208
Actually,
I came here looking for someone.

1511
01:43:31,586 --> 01:43:33,748
Some chapters from my
past are still incomplete.

1512
01:43:35,623 --> 01:43:36,590
...and I'm here to complete them.

1513
01:43:36,724 --> 01:43:38,658
But..aren't you a musician?

1514
01:43:39,427 --> 01:43:43,762
Yes. - So..what's all this
about books..pages..etcetera..

1515
01:43:47,669 --> 01:43:48,864
Meera..

1516
01:43:50,471 --> 01:43:51,529
How do I tell you?

1517
01:43:52,040 --> 01:43:53,599
L.. - Forget it.

1518
01:43:53,741 --> 01:43:56,369
Eat your food and
take some rest. Okay?

1519
01:43:57,679 --> 01:44:02,048
And then we'll talk about
your..incomplete chapters, later..

1520
01:44:02,350 --> 01:44:02,976
Okay?

1521
01:44:03,985 --> 01:44:05,009
0K8'!-

1522
01:44:11,993 --> 01:44:13,927
'How will destiny come full circle?'

1523
01:44:15,964 --> 01:44:16,897
'I don't know.'

1524
01:44:16,965 --> 01:44:18,865
'How will I get to that point?'

1525
01:44:19,968 --> 01:44:22,437
'I wonder if Meera remembers any1hing,
like I do.'

1526
01:44:23,905 --> 01:44:27,739
'I still don't know who's Bhairo,
where he is.'

1527
01:44:36,050 --> 01:44:37,984
'I'll have to talk to Meera.'

1528
01:45:11,085 --> 01:45:14,020
Maan Singh..look..

1529
01:45:14,155 --> 01:45:18,683
Actually, I can explain this.

1530
01:45:18,793 --> 01:45:21,592
I didn't know that was Meera's room.

1531
01:45:21,696 --> 01:45:24,825
Maan Singh, it's not like you think.

1532
01:45:25,400 --> 01:45:26,868
Please believe me.

1533
01:45:27,035 --> 01:45:29,936
I was actually heading
towards the kitchen.

1534
01:45:44,886 --> 01:45:46,650
Karan sir, get some rest.

1535
01:45:47,021 --> 01:45:48,420
This happens with him every day.

1536
01:45:48,756 --> 01:45:51,123
Maan Singh sir suffers
from sleep-walking.

1537
01:46:11,045 --> 01:46:12,035
Leela!

1538
01:46:18,553 --> 01:46:19,486
Yes?

1539
01:46:19,687 --> 01:46:21,985
Come fast in breakfast.

1540
01:46:22,223 --> 01:46:23,019
What?

1541
01:46:23,091 --> 01:46:27,255
Brother, come down for breakfast.
- Coming.

1542
01:46:30,498 --> 01:46:31,966
Leela!

1543
01:47:20,982 --> 01:47:22,882
Good morning, Karan. - Good morning.

1544
01:47:23,718 --> 01:47:24,776
Had a nice sleep?

1545
01:47:27,388 --> 01:47:29,914
Actually, Leela.. - Not Leela.

1546
01:47:30,191 --> 01:47:33,320
It's Meera Ranveer Singh.

1547
01:47:35,129 --> 01:47:35,925
Meera.

1548
01:47:38,232 --> 01:47:40,132
I don't know whether
I should tell you this or not.

1549
01:47:41,035 --> 01:47:42,594
What happened?

1550
01:47:44,138 --> 01:47:46,300
Recently I've been
getting some weird dreams.

1551
01:47:46,941 --> 01:47:48,340
I see faces.

1552
01:47:49,177 --> 01:47:50,667
I hear some names.

1553
01:47:52,847 --> 01:47:55,145
I feel as if that
name's calling out to me.

1554
01:47:59,854 --> 01:48:02,755
Has this ever happened
with you? - Yes.

1555
01:48:03,324 --> 01:48:04,723
It happens with me often.

1556
01:48:04,959 --> 01:48:07,860
Even l..can hear voices.

1557
01:48:08,696 --> 01:48:11,757
But..l don't see anyone.

1558
01:48:12,767 --> 01:48:14,166
How long has this been happening?

1559
01:48:14,735 --> 01:48:15,725
Every time"

1560
01:48:17,205 --> 01:48:20,175
...when I talk on the phone.

1561
01:48:20,241 --> 01:48:21,231
Get it?

1562
01:48:21,776 --> 01:48:23,676
Oh, come on, Meera, this is serious.

1563
01:48:24,011 --> 01:48:27,208
The story that began 300
years ago in Bhairo Virajna..

1564
01:48:27,715 --> 01:48:29,410
...l still see it in my dreams.

1565
01:48:29,917 --> 01:48:31,248
And the strange pan is..

1566
01:48:32,954 --> 01:48:33,853
What?

1567
01:48:34,121 --> 01:48:35,452
I see you.

1568
01:48:36,324 --> 01:48:38,053
And in the form of Leela.

1569
01:48:39,293 --> 01:48:40,351
Oh really?

1570
01:48:40,962 --> 01:48:43,192
Good morning. - Morning.

1571
01:48:44,832 --> 01:48:45,731
Hi.

1572
01:48:47,869 --> 01:48:50,167
So, Mr. Magician, how was your night?

1573
01:48:50,671 --> 01:48:52,730
He's talking about some weird dreams.

1574
01:48:53,708 --> 01:48:55,369
Dreams? What dreams?

1575
01:48:55,977 --> 01:48:59,106
It's..it's just like that.

1576
01:48:59,180 --> 01:49:00,272
Nothing serious.

1577
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:06,853
Sir.

1578
01:49:17,899 --> 01:49:19,128
Sugar?

1579
01:49:22,870 --> 01:49:24,065
Karan? - Yes?

1580
01:49:24,171 --> 01:49:25,366
Sugar?

1581
01:49:25,439 --> 01:49:26,429
Two.. - Okay.

1582
01:49:31,512 --> 01:49:32,877
What happened, Ranveer?

1583
01:49:33,347 --> 01:49:34,906
Tomorrow there's a veneration
of Vishwakarma in the village.

1584
01:49:36,317 --> 01:49:37,910
We've been celebrating
this veneration.

1585
01:49:37,985 --> 01:49:39,350
...in a grand way
for hundreds of years.

1586
01:49:39,787 --> 01:49:42,256
And this year the villagers
want you to attend it too.

1587
01:49:42,757 --> 01:49:43,781
How sweet.

1588
01:49:44,325 --> 01:49:45,520
Why don't you join us too?

1589
01:50:41,682 --> 01:50:43,116
I want to talk to you.

1590
01:50:44,085 --> 01:50:46,383
What? - I want to talk to you.

1591
01:50:47,722 --> 01:50:49,622
Come with me. Come.

1592
01:50:55,062 --> 01:50:57,827
Leela.. - My name is Meera!

1593
01:50:57,898 --> 01:50:59,024
Not Leela.

1594
01:50:59,100 --> 01:51:00,158
In this lifetime.

1595
01:51:00,401 --> 01:51:02,495
But in your previous birth,
you were Leela.

1596
01:51:02,636 --> 01:51:03,660
And I was Shravan.

1597
01:51:03,738 --> 01:51:06,833
And that Ranveer, he was Bhairo.

1598
01:51:07,508 --> 01:51:08,907
Bhairo? - Yes.

1599
01:51:09,577 --> 01:51:11,102
And he also sculpted a statue of you.

1600
01:51:14,982 --> 01:51:15,778
Look.

1601
01:51:16,417 --> 01:51:17,145
Leela.

1602
01:51:18,119 --> 01:51:19,416
That story began on this day..

1603
01:51:19,487 --> 01:51:21,012
“With the veneration of Vishwakarma..

1604
01:51:21,088 --> 01:51:22,988
...where he saw you for the first time.

1605
01:51:23,057 --> 01:51:25,424
And in this lifetime,
he wants to do the same thing.

1606
01:51:25,493 --> 01:51:26,551
Shut up, Karan.

1607
01:51:27,762 --> 01:51:31,892
I respect you because
you're Radhika's brother.

1608
01:51:32,166 --> 01:51:34,760
But I don't know
what you want to prove..

1609
01:51:35,169 --> 01:51:37,069
...by telling me this weird story.

1610
01:51:37,471 --> 01:51:39,838
Meera..try to understand.

1611
01:51:40,174 --> 01:51:43,041
Coming here, getting to Bhairo
Virajna is not a coincidence.

1612
01:51:43,210 --> 01:51:46,180
I've connected every link up to here,
only for you. - Enough!

1613
01:51:46,680 --> 01:51:48,478
I am married!

1614
01:51:48,749 --> 01:51:50,114
You've crossed the line!

1615
01:51:50,451 --> 01:51:52,044
Go away!

1616
01:52:09,303 --> 01:52:10,361
I did it.

1617
01:52:10,438 --> 01:52:12,065
I hit the jackpot.

1618
01:52:13,340 --> 01:52:16,571
You lit a torch for
me in this dark cave.

1619
01:52:16,644 --> 01:52:16,974
Your highness.

1620
01:52:17,044 --> 01:52:19,979
And its light Will
reach your home too.

1621
01:52:20,581 --> 01:52:21,309
Thank you.

1622
01:52:21,382 --> 01:52:23,817
For now..take this small token.

1623
01:52:24,618 --> 01:52:26,484
Thank you, Vikram sir.

1624
01:52:26,620 --> 01:52:32,354
By the way,
where's that long lost-traveller now?

1625
01:52:32,493 --> 01:52:35,326
There's a musical program
at the Prince's manor.

1626
01:52:35,429 --> 01:52:36,988
Come, brother Samar.

1627
01:52:37,064 --> 01:52:39,692
Let's go and pay our respects.

1628
01:52:39,800 --> 01:52:44,636
Karan..you can sing any song you like.

1629
01:52:45,306 --> 01:52:50,472
But to me, you'll be singing
the melody I want to hear.

1630
01:52:51,512 --> 01:52:58,748
"Beloved.. My beloved."

1631
01:52:58,853 --> 01:53:04,951
"Come home this time."

1632
01:53:05,659 --> 01:53:14,500
"Dwell in my eyes.."

1633
01:53:17,004 --> 01:53:22,704
"And show me your beautiful face."

1634
01:53:23,811 --> 01:53:30,478
"My hean yearns."

1635
01:53:31,886 --> 01:53:37,586
"My hean yearns without you."

1636
01:53:38,425 --> 01:53:46,765
"Don't go away again."

1637
01:53:48,836 --> 01:53:54,673
"My fair beloved..

1638
01:53:55,743 --> 01:54:05,983
...come back to my land."

1639
01:54:27,675 --> 01:54:30,838
"My nights are restless."

1640
01:54:30,911 --> 01:54:33,608
"The days torment me as well."

1641
01:54:33,681 --> 01:54:39,051
"Come back to me..beloved."

1642
01:54:39,286 --> 01:54:44,554
"l've yet to finish..
telling that imponant story."

1643
01:54:44,625 --> 01:54:50,029
"Come back..and listen to me, beloved."

1644
01:54:50,097 --> 01:54:55,467
"Without you..my heart restless."

1645
01:54:55,536 --> 01:54:57,834
"Without you.."

1646
01:54:58,105 --> 01:55:00,904
"Come back to me, beloved."

1647
01:55:00,975 --> 01:55:06,880
"Without you..my heart restless."

1648
01:55:18,592 --> 01:55:23,860
"The weathers are not the same."

1649
01:55:24,031 --> 01:55:29,060
"Even the rains feel different."

1650
01:55:29,603 --> 01:55:34,700
"The weathers are not the same."

1651
01:55:35,042 --> 01:55:39,536
"Even the rains feel different."

1652
01:55:39,613 --> 01:55:45,985
"Like the dried river..

1653
01:55:46,053 --> 01:55:50,581
...my destiny calls
out to you..beloved."

1654
01:55:50,658 --> 01:55:55,789
"Without you..my heart restless."

1655
01:55:55,863 --> 01:55:58,628
"Without you.."

1656
01:55:58,699 --> 01:56:01,430
"Come back to me, beloved."

1657
01:56:01,502 --> 01:56:06,804
"Without you..my heart restless."

1658
01:56:06,874 --> 01:56:09,434
"Without you.."

1659
01:56:09,977 --> 01:56:12,105
"Without you.."

1660
01:56:12,613 --> 01:56:14,411
"Without you.."

1661
01:56:57,791 --> 01:57:04,128
"O drummer, your drums are thumping,"

1662
01:57:04,198 --> 01:57:07,361
"The drums are thumping."

1663
01:57:07,434 --> 01:57:13,931
"O drummer, your drums are thumping,"

1664
01:57:14,007 --> 01:57:17,170
"The drums are thumping."

1665
01:57:17,244 --> 01:57:23,741
"O drummer, your drums are thumping,"

1666
01:57:23,817 --> 01:57:26,980
"The drums are thumping."

1667
01:57:27,054 --> 01:57:30,183
"The drums are thumping."

1668
01:57:30,257 --> 01:57:34,023
"The drums are thumping."

1669
01:57:37,097 --> 01:57:38,223
Meera!

1670
01:57:43,704 --> 01:57:44,432
What happened?

1671
01:57:44,738 --> 01:57:45,466
Meera!

1672
01:57:54,214 --> 01:57:55,147
Thank you, doctor. - It's okay.

1673
01:57:55,215 --> 01:57:55,977
Come.

1674
01:57:58,419 --> 01:58:00,854
She shouldn't have stopped
her medication so abruptly.

1675
01:58:00,921 --> 01:58:02,719
Anyway, she's fine.

1676
01:58:02,790 --> 01:58:05,157
I'll prescribe some medicines.
- No, doctor.

1677
01:58:05,692 --> 01:58:07,387
The reason behind
her illness is different.

1678
01:58:08,729 --> 01:58:10,788
I'll take Meera back to London soon.

1679
01:58:11,765 --> 01:58:12,994
Goodnight doctor. - Goodnight.

1680
01:58:19,506 --> 01:58:21,133
Ranveer Singh!

1681
01:58:32,052 --> 01:58:33,679
I want to talk to Meera.

1682
01:58:33,954 --> 01:58:35,444
Listen to me carefully.

1683
01:58:36,089 --> 01:58:38,490
Don't fuel my hatred.

1684
01:58:38,892 --> 01:58:43,227
If anything happens to Meera,
you'll face my wrath.

1685
01:58:43,664 --> 01:58:46,895
No one ever got love for hatred.

1686
01:58:47,568 --> 01:58:50,833
Don't try to take undue
advantage of Rajpufs love, Karan.

1687
01:58:51,171 --> 01:58:52,570
If his hatred awakens.

1688
01:58:52,639 --> 01:58:54,971
...you will wish that you were dead.

1689
01:58:56,510 --> 01:58:57,807
I want to talk to Meera.

1690
01:59:00,080 --> 01:59:04,210
If I didn't care about Radhika,
you would've been long dead.

1691
01:59:06,286 --> 01:59:10,484
Look, the Jaisalmer border
ends at 25 kilometers.

1692
01:59:11,859 --> 01:59:13,759
I'll give you 20 minutes.

1693
01:59:14,928 --> 01:59:17,124
If I still see you around..

1694
01:59:17,264 --> 01:59:19,961
...then, your search
will end with your death.

1695
01:59:35,849 --> 01:59:39,251
If you kill him,
how will I find the statue?

1696
01:59:39,853 --> 01:59:41,685
Come sister-in-law. - Leave me.

1697
01:59:41,822 --> 01:59:44,757
And the heroine should
be in the villain's clutches.

1698
01:59:51,231 --> 01:59:52,221
Shall we go?

1699
01:59:59,209 --> 02:00:00,699
Where's the statue?

1700
02:00:08,652 --> 02:00:11,713
I don't even remember the name.

1701
02:00:11,855 --> 02:00:13,789
...of the girl I was with last night.

1702
02:00:14,157 --> 02:00:17,388
And you..remember your previous birth.

1703
02:00:25,268 --> 02:00:27,669
So..where's the statue?

1704
02:00:28,605 --> 02:00:29,629
I don't know.

1705
02:00:30,874 --> 02:00:32,808
You really don't know
where the statue is.

1706
02:00:33,276 --> 02:00:34,471
'Leela.'

1707
02:00:34,544 --> 02:00:36,273
'I don't want to get any statue made.'

1708
02:00:36,446 --> 02:00:37,845
I said I don't know.

1709
02:00:40,884 --> 02:00:42,511
'I will behead you.'

1710
02:00:44,688 --> 02:00:47,316
'My name's Leela.'

1711
02:00:49,926 --> 02:00:51,894
'Angel in the form of human.'

1712
02:00:53,797 --> 02:00:55,492
'I don't want a statue.'

1713
02:00:55,565 --> 02:00:58,899
'We can get married.. - Marriage!'

1714
02:01:00,704 --> 02:01:01,762
'Bhairo!'

1715
02:01:02,739 --> 02:01:03,706
Move aside.

1716
02:01:07,877 --> 02:01:10,471
'I'll show the depths of my hatred.'

1717
02:01:10,747 --> 02:01:11,771
'sol.

1718
02:01:26,630 --> 02:01:28,325
'Look..my statue.'

1719
02:01:32,802 --> 02:01:34,236
The statue was there.

1720
02:01:48,218 --> 02:01:54,487
Sister-in-law..why do you
want to save him every time?

1721
02:01:55,425 --> 02:01:56,551
Vikram.

1722
02:01:57,227 --> 02:01:58,285
Move.

1723
02:01:59,396 --> 02:01:59,760
Vikram sir.

1724
02:01:59,829 --> 02:02:00,660
Stop!

1725
02:02:05,735 --> 02:02:09,797
Your statue..is behind that wall!

1726
02:02:12,809 --> 02:02:14,004
Go get it.

1727
02:02:14,911 --> 02:02:17,505
RascaLyou could've told me before.

1728
02:02:17,847 --> 02:02:19,212
It would've saved you the thrashing.

1729
02:02:19,449 --> 02:02:20,473
Break down that wall.

1730
02:02:22,352 --> 02:02:22,910
Come.

1731
02:02:22,986 --> 02:02:24,818
Come fast.

1732
02:02:25,922 --> 02:02:27,754
Break this wall.

1733
02:02:30,360 --> 02:02:30,849
Fast.

1734
02:02:31,027 --> 02:02:32,290
Break from here.

1735
02:02:32,462 --> 02:02:34,521
You finally believe me..

1736
02:02:35,632 --> 02:02:37,327
...that I was telling the truth.

1737
02:02:37,767 --> 02:02:39,428
Don't you have strength in those arms.

1738
02:02:41,404 --> 02:02:42,337
For 300 years..l've been living..

1739
02:02:42,405 --> 02:02:44,533
“With the wounds inflicted by Bhairo.

1740
02:02:44,874 --> 02:02:49,607
But maybe..the Lord's
finally taken mercy on me.

1741
02:03:08,431 --> 02:03:10,490
Found it. I found it.

1742
02:03:10,800 --> 02:03:13,064
I found the statue.

1743
02:03:17,607 --> 02:03:19,598
I found the statue.

1744
02:03:20,710 --> 02:03:21,905
Vikram Singh!

1745
02:03:32,522 --> 02:03:33,853
Vikram!

1746
02:03:51,741 --> 02:03:53,004
Beat him!

1747
02:04:21,771 --> 02:04:22,704
Beat him!

1748
02:04:52,669 --> 02:04:54,068
Ranveer!

1749
02:04:57,640 --> 02:05:00,541
You severed all the blood
ties by shedding blood.

1750
02:05:01,344 --> 02:05:04,314
And also invited your
death by touching my Meera.

1751
02:05:06,115 --> 02:05:10,279
Now..Bhairo Virajna
belongs only to me.

1752
02:05:11,688 --> 02:05:13,850
Casedismissed!

1753
02:05:47,657 --> 02:05:51,594
This time..history won't be repeated.

1754
02:05:52,295 --> 02:05:55,424
In this life time..Bhairo will die.

1755
02:05:55,765 --> 02:05:58,894
Two lovers..won't be separated.

1756
02:06:00,904 --> 02:06:02,338
L..- Karan!

1757
02:06:04,607 --> 02:06:07,770
How dare you touch Ranveer!

1758
02:06:08,177 --> 02:06:09,576
He's my husband.

1759
02:06:12,715 --> 02:06:16,583
If you touch him,
Meera won't spare you!

1760
02:06:31,401 --> 02:06:32,698
Shravan and Leela were dead.

1761
02:06:36,639 --> 02:06:39,768
And the one who hid that
statue behind the wall..

1762
02:06:39,842 --> 02:06:42,140
...would know this fact.

1763
02:06:42,478 --> 02:06:43,536
That's the truth, Karan.

1764
02:07:13,910 --> 02:07:15,605
That's the truth, Karan.

1765
02:07:17,180 --> 02:07:18,170
You are Bhairo.

1766
02:07:43,039 --> 02:07:44,063
Ranveer.

1767
02:07:45,775 --> 02:07:47,436
How do you know all this?

1768
02:07:48,378 --> 02:07:50,870
Because 300 years ago,
we died together.

1769
02:07:53,583 --> 02:07:54,846
Shravan?

1770
02:08:08,498 --> 02:08:10,489
Meera didn't remember anything
about her previous life.

1771
02:08:12,068 --> 02:08:14,503
Nor did I try to remind her.

1772
02:08:16,606 --> 02:08:18,574
Nature played a strange trick on us.

1773
02:08:19,509 --> 02:08:20,806
Meera was born with the same face..

1774
02:08:20,877 --> 02:08:22,675
"But gave us different faces.

1775
02:08:26,115 --> 02:08:28,607
'Now I'll use them to punish you.'

1776
02:08:40,730 --> 02:08:43,028
300 years ago you committed the crime.

1777
02:08:44,600 --> 02:08:46,261
And so you were being punished.

1778
02:08:50,740 --> 02:08:51,866
'Since I moved in this house..'

1779
02:08:51,941 --> 02:08:53,431
'..l've been seeing weird dreams.'

1780
02:08:53,509 --> 02:08:55,238
'You didn't move in that house alone.'

1781
02:08:55,311 --> 02:08:58,838
'Some unwanted memories
also entered that home with you.'

1782
02:09:12,295 --> 02:09:15,162
I could've killed
you and taken my revenge.

1783
02:09:17,200 --> 02:09:18,861
But fate had already
taken its revenge.

1784
02:09:21,237 --> 02:09:23,797
And so, I felt sympathetic
instead of hatred.

1785
02:09:26,876 --> 02:09:30,107
You are Bhairo, not Shravan, Karan.

1786
02:09:31,514 --> 02:09:34,449
You didn't endure that injustice,
you're the one who caused it.

1787
02:09:35,852 --> 02:09:38,514
You caused them so much pain..

1788
02:09:38,654 --> 02:09:43,216
...that, you're not even
worthy of their hatred.

1789
02:09:44,327 --> 02:09:46,796
Fate has brought you to this bend.

1790
02:09:47,230 --> 02:09:48,755
...so that you could be punished.

1791
02:09:50,800 --> 02:09:54,828
And you can wash off the stains
of their blood with your own blood.

1792
02:09:58,174 --> 02:09:59,198
Karan!

1793
02:10:09,352 --> 02:10:10,444
No, Karan!

1794
02:10:21,764 --> 02:10:22,856
Let me go, Shravan.

1795
02:10:22,932 --> 02:10:24,263
No, Karan!

1796
02:10:24,867 --> 02:10:26,596
It's best for Bhairo to die.

1797
02:10:26,869 --> 02:10:28,234
You're wrong, Karan.

1798
02:10:29,605 --> 02:10:31,733
You're not Bhairo, nor am I Shravan.

1799
02:10:32,308 --> 02:10:33,173
And if you end your life like this.

1800
02:10:33,242 --> 02:10:36,234
...you won't gain salvation,
nor repentance.

1801
02:10:36,379 --> 02:10:38,473
No my.. - No, Karan.

1802
02:10:38,548 --> 02:10:42,178
Bhairo should've died, not Karan.

1803
02:10:42,552 --> 02:10:46,352
Our next binh is not
only for revenge or repentance.

1804
02:10:47,924 --> 02:10:52,623
The Lord gives us an opponunity
to apologies and pardon.

1805
02:10:53,629 --> 02:10:55,791
We forgive you for killing us.

1806
02:10:56,199 --> 02:10:56,961
Yes, Karan.

1807
02:10:57,867 --> 02:10:59,835
Come.

1808
02:11:00,570 --> 02:11:01,560
Yes Karan.

1809
02:11:21,057 --> 02:11:21,956
Rajiv.

1810
02:11:22,458 --> 02:11:23,050
Hey, Rajiv.

1811
02:11:23,359 --> 02:11:24,383
What are you listening?

1812
02:11:24,527 --> 02:11:27,326
It's the remix of 'Tere Bin'.
It's fantastic.

1813
02:11:27,496 --> 02:11:28,861
It'll be a platinum hit, for sure.

1814
02:11:30,266 --> 02:11:31,324
Look.

1815
02:11:32,268 --> 02:11:33,394
See that.

1816
02:11:34,370 --> 02:11:36,634
The song that reminded me of my past.

1817
02:11:38,407 --> 02:11:40,432
"Also fulfilled all
my dreams of this lifetime.

1818
02:11:42,545 --> 02:11:43,637
Let me hear it too.

1819
02:11:46,048 --> 02:11:47,072
Hey bro.. - Yeah!

1820
02:11:47,516 --> 02:11:49,006
Will be screaming "Leela" again?

1821
02:11:51,854 --> 02:11:53,015
Let's go.

1822
02:11:53,456 --> 02:11:55,288
Leela!

1823
02:12:06,102 --> 02:12:10,300
"My nights are restless."

1824
02:12:10,373 --> 02:12:13,707
"The days torment me as well."

1825
02:12:13,776 --> 02:12:20,876
"Come back to me..beloved."

1826
02:12:20,950 --> 02:12:27,947
"l've yet to finish..telling
that imponant story."

1827
02:12:28,024 --> 02:12:34,953
"Come back..and listen to me,
beloved."

1828
02:12:35,031 --> 02:12:41,801
"Without you..my heart restless."

1829
02:12:42,004 --> 02:12:45,099
"Without you.."

1830
02:12:45,608 --> 02:12:49,044
"Come back to me, beloved."

1831
02:12:49,111 --> 02:12:57,781
"Without you..my heart restless."

1832
02:13:17,707 --> 02:13:24,579
"Without you..my heart restless."

1833
02:13:24,647 --> 02:13:27,776
"Without you.."

1834
02:13:28,117 --> 02:13:31,678
"Come back to me, beloved."

1835
02:13:31,754 --> 02:13:40,595
"Without you..my heart restless."
