If you'll go In there,

8
00:02:49,567 --> 00:02:54,016
People should know what happens In
India on the name of cricket.

9
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:00,040
Dump the tension bro

Azhar you're away from your target,

14
00:04:10,733 --> 00:04:14,044
Everything was going perfect,

15
00:04:14,667 --> 00:04:16,044
Mea ns, Ind ia's so n-I n-law.

Life was going cool

17
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,077
you've come alone?
Where's sangeeta sister?

18
00:04:31,567 --> 00:04:35,174
She's on shooting.

19
00:04:36,167 --> 00:04:39,979
It tells the time correctly,
and tells also that ls time right or not

20
00:04:40,733 --> 00:04:45,011
I saw this watch and
It's outta my budget.

I got a question, do you think after
your 99 matches you'll be captain again

26
00:05:24,133 --> 00:05:28,047
I don't perform so I become captain,
but India wins.

27
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,113
I'm still young, don't think
about retirement"

00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:46,112

Azhar had a locker
In a royal hotel.

00:08:22,467 --> 00:08:26,711
Hensey said on 15 june that azhar

I'm not a big lawyer.

00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,241
You're not big lawyer..
But you're my old friend.

77
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,580
You go and hire any big lawyer.

78
00:11:53,033 --> 00:11:55,035
Your're richman, you can afford It.

79
00:11:56,067 --> 00:11:58,673
Whoever has less friends..
They're not rich.

80
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,044
When friend ls not on my side.

89
00:13:00,133 --> 00:13:03,342
And he said that I don't
want to fight this case.

90
00:13:05,533 --> 00:13:07,069
Free publicity ls out of my hand.

91
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:25,013
Where're you going,
and why you denied to raja.

92
00:13:25,467 --> 00:13:28,004
He's top lawyer of country.

93
00:13:29,133 --> 00:13:32,580
I don't want to win the case.

94
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:36,338
You were saying 5 min ago
that I've to fight the case.

95
00:13:37,167 --> 00:13:38,976

00:13:49,367 --> 00:13:52,109
But how people are
looking at me I can't see.

00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:57,979

00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:33,238

Your dialougue of amitabh,

118
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,707
You answer him by playing
not speaking.

119
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,977
If you'll speakwith mouth
so few people will listen

120
00:16:12,467 --> 00:16:17,075
If bat will speak, so everybody
has to listen It.

121
00:16:18,767 --> 00:16:22,681
You'll play 100 matches for India.

122
00:16:24,033 --> 00:16:25,637
This bat will become your voice.

123
00:16:33,167 --> 00:16:37,172
Just learned the bat language.

124
00:16:37,733 --> 00:16:42,705
That day It became my passion.

<i>Are you doctor or nurse]</i>

Don't be smart.

Not with you but

00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,205
We'll do batting tll 2 days.

140

What happened?
Everybody got silent.

141

If I'll not play today,

143

I won't play less than
100 tests"

Before the england"
A young player from hyderabad.

That meera sings the bhajan,

00:24:13,033 --> 00:24:16,071
Once she was arguing with
defendend, judge said order.

154

But I fight with many
people that azhar can't do It.

157
00:24:41,767 --> 00:24:45,374
I was his biggest fan.

158
00:24:52,433 --> 00:24:54,140
That's what I've to procve In court.

159
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:03,474
I'm going to India
for meeting azhar's wife.

160
00:25:09,233 --> 00:25:11,270
Who can be more

245
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:40,647
Has to see India's religion,

00:52:15,167 --> 00:52:18,376
As you can see azhar still
ls answering In his style.

If I'm true, my god will save me,
I swear I'll say true.

253
00:54:44,467 --> 00:54:47,038
If human ls changed,

Not getting the result
of prayer people changes god

255
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:55,478
when azhar came to know
that he has less days for playing.

00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:58,546
50 he started
playing by taking money.

My client was unlucky,
his intention weren't bad.

264
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:11,107
Often cricket gets out because
of ta king wrong decision.

What girls... If you stuck In that
mess, your concentration will be bad.

343
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:58,245
To not seeing beautifull girl

real life..

diference between real and fake.

01:11:13,134 --> 01:11:18,174
Look near her,
she's real heroin"

shown betweeen you both

352
01:14:10,734 --> 01:14:13,977
to seeing some faces,

01:14:18,367 --> 01:14:22,315
You know him

359
01:17:05,067 --> 01:17:07,274
Because of your
bad sight, don't wet your eyes

360
01:17:28,167 --> 01:17:32,547
you gave her your name,
never betray with her.

361
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:43,140
I came back home..
Noreen was with me

362
01:17:44,700 --> 01:17:47,613

01:18:07,167 --> 01:18:10,671
With what?
Dreams.

367
01:19:35,134 --> 01:19:38,513
Why'd I see her eyes.

368
01:19:39,300 --> 01:19:41,337
Do I've come here
to see her eyes.

369
01:20:31,167 --> 01:20:35,115
God plays game, whatever we
wants don't gives us.

370
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:39,379
And with we go away,
It shows us on every corner.

371
01:21:51,201 --> 01:21:54,114

01:21:56,534 --> 01:22:00,038
I need to talk to you

373
01:22:02,067 --> 01:22:04,240

If you'll not tell her so I'll tell her

374

since I met you

375
01:22:09,101 --> 01:22:11,741
I see only face..

376
01:22:12,500 --> 01:22:15,572
That's wrong.
Go from here.

377
01:22:16,267 --> 01:22:18,008
If I'd be In control,
so I'd never come here.

378
01:26:52,267 --> 01:26:53,575

Why do we not talk much.

There are so ma ny guest
In house, talk to them

398
01:32:07,101 --> 01:32:10,241
I'm not running away.

399
01:32:12,534 --> 01:32:15,481
But I'll go, to join new series.

400
01:32:16,467 --> 01:32:19,505
Are you talking about packing}

401
01:32:20,567 --> 01:32:25,038

01:32:39,434 --> 01:32:43,075
I gone out for series
without telling noreen

404
01:32:45,134 --> 01:32:51,107
what I couldn't tell this
to noreen, I tell this to world.

405
01:34:26,700 --> 01:34:30,113
First time I think about myself.

406
01:34:30,501 --> 01:34:37,009
You should've think before
named the match to her..

407
01:34:38,134 --> 01:34:40,045
That my name ls merged
with yours.

408
01:34:42,100 --> 01:34:47,709
You showed this to world"
It'd be late to tell you face to face

409
01:34:51,167 --> 01:34:52,646
It was right time.

410
01:35:57,200 --> 01:35:59,578
I gave her up but
couldn't give up

411
01:36:01,101 --> 01:36:05,106
she's just like my bad habit.

412
01:36:07,101 --> 01:36:08,546
Whatever I did with
noreen, was bad.

413
01:36:10,200 --> 01:36:11,645
Maybe I'm In this condition

414
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:18,413
changes ls life's reality

415
01:36:19,501 --> 01:36:22,141
I'm not going ct change
my decision... sangeeta will not come

416
01:36:22,634 --> 01:36:26,013
you try to hide her,
but she'll mention her..

417
01:36:33,734 --> 01:36:40,083
If any stranger fell on road,
few people comes to help him

418
01:36:42,034 --> 01:36:47,347
It's been 8 years of this case,
still nobody has come

419
01:36:49,134 --> 01:36:50,511
his own wife..

420
01:36:51,501 --> 01:36:54,641
Neither sangeeta, nor ncreen.

421
01:36:55,267 --> 01:36:57,543
Nor family and fans..

422
01:37:01,134 --> 01:37:04,047
Have anybody come"

423
01:37:06,434 --> 01:37:12,146
He played so much cricket,
but couldn't make friends..

424
01:37:12,500 --> 01:37:14,036
Who can stand near you

425
01:37:15,134 --> 01:37:18,741
what ls the reason of It.

426
01:37:21,467 --> 01:37:26,143
Because everybody believes
that azhar did It.

427
01:37:27,167 --> 01:37:28,441
And azhar ls behind everything.

428
01:38:27,301 --> 01:38:29,076
By ta king this case,
there are many haerings..

429
01:38:30,501 --> 01:38:34,472
8 nov, we'll announce
the result"

430
01:38:35,200 --> 01:38:36,543

431
01:38:41,600 --> 01:38:45,639
The accusation were In air

432
01:38:46,467 --> 01:38:49,004

you're my fan.

01:38:50,101 --> 01:38:53,173

You'll be again

434
01:38:53,767 --> 01:38:56,680
you can't do match fixing here.

435
01:38:57,101 --> 01:38:58,978
I couldn't understand one thing.

436
01:38:59,200 --> 01:39:02,113
I gave you money
before case starts"

437
01:39:05,067 --> 01:39:08,139
You kept the money,
and against me.

438
01:39:08,767 --> 01:39:13,011
You're saying rubbish,
this kind of anger ls In me..

439
01:39:14,267 --> 01:39:18,147
In the court, the false accusation
are around here..

440
01:39:19,301 --> 01:39:21,247
And true man has to
carefull about head.

441
01:41:00,067 --> 01:41:03,014
This all was missing"
That's my reality

442
01:41:03,501 --> 01:41:06,107
peoples crowd, the noise of my name.

443
01:41:11,467 --> 01:41:15,142
You're experiecing this

444
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:20,005
Whatever I'm because of this fans.

So move your body then.

446

Is that place to do batting.

449
01:42:29,034 --> 01:42:31,014
You're azhar,
you can do batting anywhere.

450
01:42:34,767 --> 01:42:39,216
If you'll not show your
shots, so what's benefit to call you

451
01:42:41,201 --> 01:42:44,114

453
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:21,743
Answer them by playing
not speaking.

454
01:43:23,034 --> 01:43:25,708
If you speakwith mouth,
I can't do it..

455
01:43:29,034 --> 01:43:33,176
Anybody can give me bat,
I'm player not monkey.

456
01:43:34,001 --> 01:43:36,538
I can't show you tricks.

457
01:43:59,334 --> 01:44:02,110
Today nothing left.
But I'm happy

458
01:44:03,067 --> 01:44:08,073
now I don't care. when we don't
care In life, then change comes.

459
01:45:40,734 --> 01:45:44,147
Let us call that guy,
If you think It's misleading

460
01:45:44,500 --> 01:45:46,207
so you reject the witness.

461
01:45:49,167 --> 01:45:51,169
Mr. reddy you can
call your witness.

462
01:45:54,101 --> 01:45:58,709
Just not have to call,
has to request you

463
01:46:01,167 --> 01:46:04,444
witness name ls
miss meera verma.

464

It happened..

466
01:46:29,200 --> 01:46:33,171
It's a canada's reference..

467
01:46:34,434 --> 01:46:36,436
Court job ls to judge"

468
01:47:55,534 --> 01:47:58,174
Dear meera, something ls
troubling me..

469
01:47:58,534 --> 01:48:02,710
Before the procedure, you were
forcing azhar for take oath.

470
01:48:03,301 --> 01:48:08,080
What was the reason

471
01:48:08,667 --> 01:48:14,276
It's procedure so witness
don't lie.

472
01:48:15,167 --> 01:48:16,612
And only true comes out.

473
01:48:18,201 --> 01:48:22,650
If one man has two statments ..
One under oath and second not.

474
01:48:23,200 --> 01:48:26,238
What statement ls believed
to be true...oath.

475
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:56,040
You're silent"

478
01:50:09,534 --> 01:50:12,037
I'm not here sitting
to say order order.

479
01:50:12,400 --> 01:50:16,007
I'm noticing statement,
don't remind me.

480
01:50:19,200 --> 01:50:22,409
Who did this ban on my client.

481
01:50:23,167 --> 01:50:27,616
And who took action

482
01:50:28,100 --> 01:50:30,102
the head of cricket association

483
01:50:34,034 --> 01:50:38,346
who gives salawto mr. madhavan panel.

484
01:50:43,067 --> 01:50:44,705
Cricket association

01:50:45,534 --> 01:50:48,140
this ls my point"
Association ban It

486
01:50:49,500 --> 01:50:51,309
association decided the panel.

487
01:50:52,034 --> 01:50:54,241
Assocaition gives the
salawto panel.

488
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,071
50 how come this panel
can stay neutral.

489
01:52:49,067 --> 01:52:52,571
Look they're talking
about you on news..

490
01:52:53,534 --> 01:52:57,641
You should see..

491
01:52:58,434 --> 01:53:01,313
We'll tell you what kapil
thinks abut azhar..

492
01:53:09,167 --> 01:53:12,239
What ls the truth In alligation

493
01:53:14,100 --> 01:53:22,076
100% eye seeing things
are not even true.

494
01:53:25,167 --> 01:53:27,511
How can be this heared
things can be real.

495
01:53:28,567 --> 01:53:34,984
In my sight, azhar ls very
good player and captain

496
01:53:38,500 --> 01:53:41,640
as far as I know, he's innocent.

497
01:55:43,167 --> 01:55:45,977
Listen, write down 50
on the lose of lndia..

498
01:56:02,267 --> 01:56:09,276
Indian viewer are happy again.

499
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:15,109
But dangerman ls still on crease.

500
01:56:16,334 --> 01:56:19,679
This captaincy ls not easy.

501
01:58:32,567 --> 01:58:35,639
Judge has called you
twice, you come fast.

502
01:58:39,067 --> 01:58:41,604
This case wasn't easy

503
01:58:42,234 --> 01:58:46,205
people's anger and media..
Truth ls always on front.

504
01:58:47,234 --> 01:58:49,180
But It takes time to reach there.

505
01:58:58,768 --> 01:59:02,739
Azhar has to play
captain's inning.

506
02:01:49,267 --> 02:01:53,579
Many peoples made mistake,
c.b.l mistake

507
02:01:55,601 --> 02:01:57,581
bookie charge sheet wasn't made.

508
02:04:25,401 --> 02:04:27,403
My grandpa told me
that I'll play 100 matchs.

509
02:04:28,167 --> 02:04:29,510
But you played 99

510
02:04:31,434 --> 02:04:34,278
this court case wasn't
less than a test match.

511
02:04:36,734 --> 02:04:39,544
This was the biggest
test match of my lfie

512
02:04:41,534 --> 02:04:45,175
It's not my mistake,
he took money

513
02:04:45,667 --> 02:04:47,613
and said he will play
according to us.

514
02:05:50,301 --> 02:05:55,512
This ls the stow of my
all innings... believe or not

515
02:05:58,101 --> 02:05:59,603
I leave on you

516
02:06:01,200 --> 02:06:06,650
I fight the case..
Because I know"

517
02:06:07,434 --> 02:06:09,971
Record ls on 100,
nobody claps on 99..
