1
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:39,120
SILLINESS

2
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,360
This isn't done, sir.
You guaranteed you'd teach me in a week!

3
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,440
I'll be promoted today,
so life will be moving forward...

4
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,160
- I can't even reverse the car!
- Relax, I'll make you an expert.

5
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,680
See this watch?

6
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,080
A gift from my student.

7
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,080
The watch is local, but not my student.

8
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,160
It's a reward for being a teacher.
Don't you forget.

9
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,560
Come on now, try once more.

10
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:12,450
Why are you wasting time
on teaching manual gears

11
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,400
when mine's gonna be an automatic one?

12
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,880
You'll be able to drive any car
in the world if you can learn this.

13
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,360
Today you have an automatic car,
later, you might not afford a bicycle.

14
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:25,240
Must you utter such evil words?
My promotion is due. Say something nice.

15
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,480
Listen, mister!
If I receive my teacher's reward today

16
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,160
you will get your promotion too.

17
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,520
I'll never reach the office if it goes on
like this. Forget promotion, car and...

18
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:35,890
- Got a girlfriend?
- Does it matter?

19
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,080
What's her name again?

20
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,570
Mayera.

21
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,280
Start the car.

22
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,000
Now focus on her face
and leave the clutch with ease.

23
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,680
Mayera!

24
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,400
- Yeah, baby! Mayera!
- See the magic of love?

25
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,920
Hey jigida jigida
Hey jigida jigida

26
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,880
Hey jigida jigida
Hey hey jigida jigida

27
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,680
Someone tell the stars
not to bend so much

28
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,640
The sun lights my nights like a candle

29
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,320
Impatient goals knock at my door
with such eagerness

30
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:34,060
The lines of my palm
change with my will

31
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,480
I've been given a blank sheet in my hand

32
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,160
My days will be the way I write them!

33
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:47,080
What is to fear
when God is a childhood friend?

34
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,320
I am the master of my will

35
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,880
Hey! jigida jigida

36
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,480
Hi, hotness! Is it new?

37
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,920
From Zara. You like?

38
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,520
Very hot. Shall I gobble you up?

39
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:27,755
See you at lunch.

40
00:03:27,876 --> 00:03:30,880
Your promotion is due today,
so eat in your cubicle, okay?

41
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,240
Look extra busy, okay? Bye, bye, bye, bye!

42
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,840
Mornings come at my will

43
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,760
The moon revolves around my roof-top

44
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,840
what is ours is yours
and yours is ours.

45
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,800
Our horizontals and your verticals
got integrated

46
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,120
by forward planning
and long-term thinking.

47
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,680
I've an account at the shop of wishes

48
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:06,040
Even destiny is designed
to fit my desires

49
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,480
Like balls of wool

50
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,280
My ways unfold below my feet

51
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:18,800
If my destination is out of the world

52
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,590
It will come to me running for sure.

53
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:25,360
Congratulations, sir.
You made the right decision.

54
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,040
I'll mail you the contract
right away, sir.

55
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,000
I got it! Am I not the coolest?

56
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,400
- Promotion?
- Post-lunch.

57
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,570
Post-lunch.

58
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,240
Those better than me,
Try a hundred schemes

59
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,920
But I'm not afraid of them

60
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:55,800
If you block my road,
I will try my best

61
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,120
I will move ahead somehow

62
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,240
I will bolt my plans in place

63
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,280
I will turn the spanner strong

64
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,720
Thus, I will secure my victory
no matter what

65
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,680
Far from the sky
Even if you tie me to the ground,

66
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:16,280
I shall still fly away high

67
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,880
Damn it! What a crappy raise!

68
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,920
What about you?

69
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,840
Pity, they took their sweet time!

70
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:43,680
If they'd done this a year ago,
productivity would've been doubled by now.

71
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,040
- Guess the credit limit.
- Hmm... two?

72
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,680
Huh! Three!

73
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:25,800
Mayera, no. Mayera!
You just bought sandals last month.

74
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,240
Shall I gobble you up?

75
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,640
They're a little expensive.

76
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,900
Should I buy?

77
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,000
- When did this happen?
- Today!

78
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,440
And the credit limit?
Four hundred thousand?

79
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,880
And here I'm showing off
my 300,000 gold card.

80
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,160
I didn't want to spoil your excitement.
That's why.

81
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,640
Mayera! You...

82
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:31,040
Not that, silly!
We've been together for two years.

83
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,520
- Now what?
- What?

84
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,600
Dad is looking for prospects.
That too, multimillionaires.

85
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,320
Very well. I will say yes
to the richest guy.

86
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:13,400
If I was promoted a year ago

87
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,880
I would've proposed

88
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,440
and saved you already from
your dad, Osama's bombardment.

89
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,390
Anyway, now that I'm a Senior Executive...
So...?

90
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,560
Let me tell dad.

91
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,040
Mention Senior Executive Mohit Chaddha.
Osama will be impressed.

92
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:47,360
Call my dad "Osama" once more
and I'll mix RDX in your coffee!

93
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,240
- Tell him about my car, okay?
- Okay.

94
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,640
- Tell him that...
- Shush... it's ringing.

95
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,640
- Hi, Dad.
- What happened to the lunch-time call?

96
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,920
I was in an important meeting.
I sent you a message, you never read them?

97
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,480
Should I read my transfer
orders or your messages?

98
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,080
Just a month away from my retirement

99
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,320
and they've transferred me
to bloody Animal Husbandry!

100
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,640
- Animal what?
- Husbandry...

101
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,600
It's under the Ministry of Agriculture.

102
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,000
Isn't there one decent posting in my fate?

103
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,600
I swear I'll resign, today itself.

104
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:32,840
I'll write such a resignation letter,
it'll shake up the whole government.

105
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:36,640
Like all your resignation letters that you
wrote after the last six transfers!

106
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,520
Is it? You'll see this time.

107
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,520
I'll do it this time. Just wait and see.

108
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,800
- He's very jumpy right now.
- More than normal?

109
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,720
I know. Poor animals!

110
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,600
You've to come and talk to him
when he'll be in a better mood.

111
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,240
I'm not coming over to talk to him
about marriage and all, okay!

112
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,440
Do it for his sake, man! He's old school.

113
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,040
He'll be happy, we'll be happy.
I love you.

114
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,480
I love you. You just make me
do everything by saying "I love you".

115
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,400
Sir, dictation... now?

116
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,200
We need to vacate
and shift to Animal Husbandry, sir!

117
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,600
No, first dictation.

118
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,600
Gursharan, don't ever
let your son become an IAS.

119
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,840
He's very interested, sir,
and very much into the preparation.

120
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,720
Isn't he just twelve?

121
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,760
But, sir, you have to start early, right?

122
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,840
Wouldn't he face the same hazards?

123
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:56,600
My son is very bright.
He will definitely reach the top.

124
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,400
And I'm not bright?

125
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,720
What? No! You are bright, sir.
You are shining bright.

126
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,000
You came fifty-eighth in
the All India Entrance Exam, sir.

127
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:09,600
Only if there was some smartness
to go with the brightness, sir.

128
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:14,800
You mean, "make me work
by lining my pocket" kind of brightness?

129
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,880
I could've reached the top then, right?

130
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,400
- Lining pockets is wrong, sir.
- Hmm...

131
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,640
That's why I encouraged my daughter
from nursery to take up a private job.

132
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:34,280
Mayera's salary is more than what
I get after thirty-five years of service.

133
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,560
You just write.

134
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,840
You're just a month
away from your retirement.

135
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,520
You'll lose your pension, sir.
Bear it for month.

136
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,880
What dictation?

137
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,080
Let's move to Animal Husbandry.

138
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,600
I'll come with you.
He won't lose it in front of me.

139
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,040
- Really?
- Really!

140
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,360
Let him just try.
Osama, Obama, I don't care.

141
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,560
What is he? A dinosaur?

142
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,480
Who sets curfews these days, man?

143
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,880
- I'm not afraid of anyone, okay!
- Mayera!

144
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,240
How many times have I told you...

145
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,520
Is anyone talking to you?

146
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,000
No, right?

147
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,160
Who is this?

148
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,760
Mohit Chaddha, Dad. He's my friend!

149
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,160
He'd got you cake and wine
on New Years Eve?

150
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,760
He was here on my birthday too.

151
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,280
He got me those expensive shoes

152
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,160
and you said what kind of
moron gifts shoes on a birthday?

153
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,840
- We even had a fight over it!
- Oh, right, yes.

154
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:56,480
- Right., Air Connect, Junior Ex...
- It's Senior, Mayera! You...

155
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,680
You?

156
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:01,580
How dare you speak
so rudely with my daughter?

157
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,000
You... err, ma'am!

158
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,800
- Senior what?
- Excuse me?

159
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:13,200
Senior peon, senior clerk,
senior typist, senior what?

160
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,120
It's quite late. You must be sleepy.

161
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,560
I've bought a new one, it's automatic.

162
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,340
Would you like to check it out?
It's so cool.

163
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,600
Executive, my foot!

164
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,640
Mayera, I love you, but today is Sunday!

165
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,640
Get up. We're going on a picnic.

166
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,730
- Are you good at frisbee?
- Huh?

167
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,280
- Three two five?
- Three two what?

168
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,880
It's a card game. I'll teach you.
Humayun's Tomb by 10:00, okay?

169
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:21,160
No way I'm wasting my Sunday on a picnic.

170
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:26,480
Mohit! Dad's in a good mood.
He's gonna retire after a few days.

171
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,440
God knows how jumpy he'll be then.

172
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,440
Talk to him today if you want to marry me.

173
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,600
Ask for his permission.

174
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,800
- Now?
- Just go!

175
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,240
- Hey, Mohit!
- Yes, sir?

176
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,720
- Help me out here, boy.
- Coming.

177
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,640
- Just fix this.
- Right away.

178
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,240
It's just a frog, not a crocodile.

179
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,200
What a coward he is!

180
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,720
Talk to him about us.

181
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,760
What are you thinking?
Why aren't you doing it?

182
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,990
- Ask, man. What are you doing?
- I can't do it.

183
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,880
- Just do it.
- I can't do it.

184
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:48,480
Hey! What are you two up to?
Are you cheating?

185
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,640
No! Not at all.

186
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,000
I'm telling him
to ask for your permission.

187
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:55,040
Right. I lost the last round too.

188
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,460
Okay, ask away.

189
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,720
Come on. Ask for my permission.

190
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,120
I was saying if you could please let me...

191
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,120
have the third one from below?

192
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,120
Third last, right?

193
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,840
One, two...

194
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,240
- What is it?
- That's an ace, an ace, Mayera!

195
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:22,920
I'm not playing this game, bloody cheats!
I'm going for a walk, you cheaters.

196
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,200
You just have to ask for his permission.
Can't you do that much?

197
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,880
Humayun's wife got this tomb built.

198
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:40,000
Shah Jahan got the same
made in white marble

199
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,560
for his wife, ma'am Mumtaz.
Taj Mahal, Agra.

200
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,760
After Taj Mahal there wasn't any
grand tomb made.

201
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:54,030
Everyone, the architects,
artists, who made the Taj, workers...

202
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,880
Shah Jahan lined them up

203
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,000
took out his sword and whack

204
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,520
cut their hands off.

205
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,120
Dad, Mohit wants to marry me.

206
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,200
- What?
- Didn't you hear me?

207
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,020
What did you say?

208
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:13,040
Not me, Mohit. Go ahead, Mohit.

209
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:22,640
Sir, my love will remain
as solid as Humayun's tomb or the Taj.

210
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:26,480
You're talking about chopping off hands.
I'm asking for her hand in marriage.

211
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,440
Hey, Dad, why are you packing up?

212
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,120
We've not even eaten the dessert.

213
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,610
Dad makes wonderful halva.
Dad?

214
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,840
Please wait, Dad.

215
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:49,000
Dad, at least answer his question dad.

216
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:00,400
People elope. We are still
asking for your permission.

217
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,520
You want to marry him? Seriously?

218
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,160
He who talks about eloping?
Criminal-minded.

219
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,120
Don't even think about it!

220
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,080
The Home Secretary is my batchmate.

221
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,240
The Police Commissioner of Delhi
sends me naughty messages.

222
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:28,000
I can make you rot in jail
for the rest of your life.

223
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,810
Dad!

224
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,040
In the car.

225
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,480
Get the rest from that boy
and check everything.

226
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,640
Come on, Mayera.

227
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,760
No. Say yes first.

228
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,720
Shall we go home and talk, please?

229
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:55,480
Look, Mayera,
the entire IAS crowd shows up here.

230
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:58,900
I don't want unnecessary gossip to spread.
So come, please.

231
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,040
Very well.
I will never speak to you again.

232
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:12,280
- Mayera?
- Let's go, Udhay Singh.

233
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,750
Good girl. I'll solve all your problems.
Don't worry.

234
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,300
Come on.

235
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,160
What is this? Emotional blackmail?

236
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,000
What emotional blackmail?

237
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,280
It's just chicken biryani with saffron.

238
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,760
And then some delicious,
sweet halva, that's all.

239
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,540
You think you'll compensate this way?
With my favorite dishes? Forget it.

240
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:04,400
All right! You just enjoy the biryani
and forget that bloody loser.

241
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,440
Dad, he's a Senior Executive!

242
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,640
And why does that matter?

243
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,880
- He's not the owner of the company, is he?
- It doesn't matter as long as he loves me.

244
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,760
Love is not the only thing.

245
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:15,840
Love is everything.

246
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,480
Love is everything?

247
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,720
What would I have done if you
hadn't felt love even after mom's death?

248
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,000
Why did you play mom's role too?

249
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,800
Other IAS dads spent their evenings
at the club with their friends.

250
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,840
But you stayed home to play with me.

251
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,400
There was no money, but I had you.

252
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,880
I had your love.

253
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,240
That was enough for me.

254
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,160
Just like Mohit's love is enough for me.

255
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,680
What more do you need?

256
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,160
Money! You need money.

257
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,800
And I'm saying this from experience.

258
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,800
Look, I had a government job.

259
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,640
I held a big post,
but my pocket was empty.

260
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:53,080
All my life I have been depriving you.

261
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:58,400
I could never give you the pocket money,
clothes or toys you deserved.

262
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,800
You wanted to go to the US for an MBA.

263
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,000
I couldn't even afford that.

264
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,520
But now I'll get you married to a rich boy

265
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,480
who can make your every wish come true.

266
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,600
And you'll refuse my biggest wish?

267
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,000
Yes. But Mohit is an absolute no.

268
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,760
Who's asking you to
get married to just anyone?

269
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,080
Here's the file. Select from here.

270
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:23,560
Each one has a net worth
of 250 million.

271
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,400
Dad, I will only marry Mohit.

272
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,640
Fine. Do what you want.

273
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,320
What do you care if I live or die?

274
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,760
Dad is not ready to listen at all, Mohit.

275
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,280
He's being so stubborn!

276
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,320
Do you know Mohit Chaddha?

277
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,640
From marketing?

278
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,280
How is his character?

279
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,680
He is always seen with one lady.

280
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,440
Always seen, huh?

281
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,160
She comes here too. No scoop, no scandal.

282
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,210
- But why are you inquiring about him?
- Survey. Family planning.

283
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:40,040
I was just passing by.
Would you like to buy me coffee?

284
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,560
And why? Who are you?

285
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,760
- I'm Sehgal.
- Sehgal, who?

286
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,240
Sehgal from Income Tax.
I've come to file a case on you.

287
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,160
I've filed all my returns.

288
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:55,000
I'm Mayera's father Sehgal, you bloody...

289
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:59,120
I'm calling from your office reception.

290
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,840
Sorry, sir. I didn't recognize your voice.

291
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,000
It's the first time on the phone.

292
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,440
Did you have some work here, sir?

293
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,000
What's your salary?

294
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,480
- Sixty-five thousand.
- Sixty-five only!

295
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,720
I'm bad at counting in Hindi.

296
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:16,040
Just like your salary.

297
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,880
My daughter, Mayera, seventy-two.

298
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,560
Her salary is seventy-two thousand.

299
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,600
What kind of a man are you?

300
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:32,040
My daughter earns more than you and
you don't care?

301
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:35,400
Come on, sir.
We both love each other. It's all cool.

302
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,240
Look, Mr. Sixty-five, sit here.

303
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:43,040
You know that song,
"Let the love never be less

304
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,400
love conquers all the loss?"
It's all nonsense.

305
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,920
I don't know what Mayera sees in you.

306
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,040
Since I don't give my approval

307
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,920
Mayera will not marry you.

308
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,040
You know that, right?

309
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:03,920
Hmm. Your probation period starts
from today.

310
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:07,920
I will examine you thoroughly.

311
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,800
If I don't detect any problem in you

312
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,760
I will say yes for the wedding.

313
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:18,680
But if I find anything wrong,
I'll reject you.

314
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,520
Understand Mr. Sixty-five?

315
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,040
You'll leave quietly then.

316
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,440
How can I agree just like that?

317
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,440
You will take the exam
and give the result as well.

318
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,640
- I don't think I stand a chance.
- Don't you have faith in yourself?

319
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,640
That I have. But then...

320
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,580
- You think I will cheat?
- Who knows?

321
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:46,520
- It's not written on anybody's face.
- Look, boy...

322
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,560
This is me being polite
to pretend you have a choice.

323
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,080
Actually you have no choice.

324
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,240
Speak up if you're ready to go on
the probation.

325
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,360
Otherwise, forget Mayera forever.

326
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,080
Mayera says you have no family.

327
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,040
Your parents died a long time ago.

328
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,320
Well, at least you'll be saved

329
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,120
from the insult if I reject you.

330
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,980
Goodbye.

331
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,720
Sir, please wait for the coffee at least.

332
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,800
One more thing.

333
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,080
Start taking interest in sports.

334
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,800
Listen, Dad doesn't like losing.

335
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,920
He'll never marry me off to a man
who defeats him.

336
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,520
It's a test. If I can't perform then...

337
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:50,080
Trust me, Mohit. This win will make you
a loser forever.

338
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,680
Hey, come on.

339
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,500
Poor guy!

340
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,720
The ball has to be picked up like this.

341
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:19,600
He's very bad at this. You lost in
three straight games.

342
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,280
You lied, right?

343
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,480
I hate lies. Ask Mayera.

344
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,760
Dad hates lies.

345
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,920
Where did you find this guy?

346
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:32,200
There are at least seven boys in my file

347
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:35,560
who've played national level
football, badminton, tennis and cricket!

348
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,360
Practise with me every day.

349
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:46,200
Chances are slim but if there is
some improvement

350
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:47,240
we will see.

351
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,320
- Sir, tomorrow I have...
- Yes?

352
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,320
He will come, Dad.

353
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,640
Get my kit. I'm going to the locker room.

354
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:07,040
I'm not gonna leave you no matter what
Dad Osama does!

355
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,600
Oh, really?!

356
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,000
What is it, huh? Staff is calling?

357
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,200
- Please, just come.
- Sir!

358
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,680
Here's a small farewell gift
from all of us.

359
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,120
Oh! You shouldn't have...

360
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,320
It's just a little something, sir.

361
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,440
- Thank you so much!
- Please open it, sir.

362
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,480
Just a minute, sir.

363
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,920
Here it is!

364
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,870
What is this?

365
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:37,240
You'll have a retired life from tomorrow.

366
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,680
- Isn't it true?
- Huh?

367
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,360
You won't be going out as much.

368
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,360
You won't be as active as you are now.

369
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,240
- So?
- This is for your fitness.

370
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,720
It helped me a lot.

371
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,000
Amazing, isn't it, sir?

372
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,920
Th... th... thank you.

373
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,720
- P... p... p... please stop this.
- Welcome, sir, welcome!

374
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:04,440
Whatever it is, it is a gift after all.

375
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,240
I've got to arrange something in return.

376
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,240
It's a total of 17 people,
including the peons.

377
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:13,040
How will you manage for everyone?

378
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:16,200
Let's get one thing that is of use
to everyone!

379
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,920
These seem expensive.

380
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:23,920
Can you show us a medium-sized TV?

381
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:28,240
Sure, sir. This way. Are you looking for
a specific brand, sir?

382
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,800
Something cheap, charming
and long-lasting...

383
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:34,280
The turbulence in the airline industry
has grounded many...

384
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,040
This is our smallest 22 inch LCD...

385
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,220
Increase the volume, please.

386
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,640
For the last two years, airline companies
have been bearing

387
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,760
the brunt of the unreliable markets.

388
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:45,280
But Air Connect is the first company that

389
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:49,080
has ousted 1200 employees at one go.

390
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,680
That's right, 1200!

391
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,400
Starting from the cabin crews,
technical, ground staff

392
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,400
to the marketing unit.

393
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,540
AGITATION OUTSIDE AIR CABINET'S OFFICE

394
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,870
She's not answering her phone.

395
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:07,560
NO FURTHER INFORMATION ON COMPENSATION

396
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,860
RESIGNATION LETTERS WERE HANDED OUT
WITHOUT NOTICE

397
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,840
Neither is Mohit.

398
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:15,680
Gursharan, Mohit's job is gone!

399
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:18,520
- Congratulations, sir.
- Congratulations to you too!

400
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,520
This will be your apartment, sea-facing

401
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,480
on the Dubai Marina.
One of the poshest localities in Dubai.

402
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,400
It is a four BHK. Look at the kitchen.

403
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,920
- What if I say no, sir?
- I'll send you to a mental asylum.

404
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,290
Sir, I'm going to get married.

405
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:47,640
Well, I didn't on count this. That you'll
refuse this offer to get married.

406
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,560
Sir, we love each other
and we can't stay apart.

407
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,040
Don't you want to see what car
they're offering you?

408
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,330
Your dad is here?

409
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,750
My Dad?

410
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:16,400
Mayera? Are you feeling okay?

411
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,640
Are you okay?

412
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,450
I'm fine.

413
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:22,120
Mohit has lost his job and you're okay?

414
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,840
- Mohit lost his job?
- Didn't you see the news?

415
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:28,120
If a big company like Air Connect
couldn't save its employees

416
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,920
then what about the smaller ones?

417
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:33,200
Demands for safe and secure jobs
in the Government are increasing.

418
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:38,160
Applications for Civil Services
entrance exams have risen by 21%...

419
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,320
In these tough times of recession,
private company jobs are...

420
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:51,480
When he had a job,
I was willing to compromise.

421
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:55,800
But I will die
before I let you marry a jobless man.

422
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,680
Hey, Mayera, Immy here.

423
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,040
Mohit, you haven't lost your job,
have you?

424
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,640
Hey... this is Immy!

425
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,370
Be serious.

426
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,000
Honestly, I'm Immy speaking.

427
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,600
Mohit's gone to fight with the boss.

428
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,120
He left his phone behind.

429
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,640
So everything is safe?

430
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:20,480
Yes, my job is safe, but Mohit's is gone.

431
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,640
I'm so relieved that your job is safe.

432
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,520
I know. But Mohit's really sad.

433
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,880
Even dad was so worried.

434
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,440
He came to my office! He's right here.

435
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,760
Dad, please go home and rest now.

436
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,000
I have to attend a very important meeting.

437
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:48,920
Dad, Mohit's job is secured.
And he will never lose it.

438
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,480
We will get married
and he will be very successful.

439
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,160
- No... look...
- Bye.

440
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:00,240
I heard them say...
all the marketing guys are gone.

441
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:08,200
- Look, I'm sorry about this.
- But I just got promoted!

442
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,120
What can I say, Mohit?

443
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:14,280
The salary you get after promotion
can save the jobs of three people.

444
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:17,280
Consider this a sacrifice
for your juniors.

445
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,880
Why don't you sacrifice?

446
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:22,040
Your salary could save
the jobs of at least eight people.

447
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:24,640
Playing CEO without knowing
anything about operation.

448
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,200
If it was me running Air Connect

449
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:32,310
there wouldn't be a loss of a single penny
even in the time of recession.

450
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,840
In fact, I was going to quit myself.

451
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:47,290
I'll get a job like this.
Double salary. Mark my words.

452
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,680
Mohit, relax. Don't get so agitated.

453
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,560
- What did she say?
- What will she say?

454
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,040
- Say thanks, I saved your job.
- How come?

455
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,800
I got promoted and I got sacked.
It could have been you too.

456
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,480
- Thanks.
- Come on, buy me a beer.

457
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,800
Not beer, but slogans. Stay with everyone.

458
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:06,160
What if they withdraw the orders?

459
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:08,340
Why don't you say sorry to the boss?

460
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,120
I've never done that in my life.

461
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,240
To this moron?! Buy me a beer.

462
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,520
Fine, don't say sorry.

463
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,760
But right now all the news channels
are gathered here.

464
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:20,200
Go for an interview, be famous.
I'll check girls out the whole time.

465
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:23,800
We want our jobs back.

466
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:30,239
We're telecasting from outside
the Air Connect offices.

467
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:33,920
- Give us our jobs back...
- People are really worried

468
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:36,000
and here with me is Mr. Imran Rizvi.

469
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:38,440
Mr. Imran Rizvi, how are you feeling?

470
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,680
- Really bad.
- Tell us in detail.

471
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,600
How did you feel when you lost your job?

472
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,680
I haven't lost my job, my job is safe.

473
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:48,320
Stop. Why are you giving
this interview then?

474
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,240
Because of my friend here.

475
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,440
How are you feeling?

476
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,780
I'm scared.

477
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,600
- He's scared.
- Scared? Of what?

478
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,600
- For Mayera.
- Mayera? Your sister

479
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:09,120
who'll commit suicide
if she doesn't get married?

480
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,400
Use one shot of his and I'll sue you.

481
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,320
Let's go from here.

482
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,000
What did you say your name was?

483
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:21,720
- Why were you giving an interview?
- Everyone was.

484
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:24,840
Is everyone getting married?
Is everyone's father like my dad?

485
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:27,280
I've convinced him that your job is safe.

486
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,240
If he sees this, he will never agree.

487
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,800
Let him not agree, man!

488
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:34,080
I'm fed up of his terms and conditions.

489
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,200
There's an economic crisis going on.

490
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,600
My company went bankrupt today.

491
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,600
Mayera, I'm jobless.

492
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:50,280
And you're worried about the lie
you've told your father!

493
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:05,520
Mohit, please don't panic.
You're so smart.

494
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,640
You'll get a job immediately.

495
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:11,240
But one lie will save our relationship.

496
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:24,280
To hide one lie,
one has to tell a hundred more.

497
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,330
Come on, let's get out of here.

498
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:45,080
Hello? I'd like to speak to
the Police Commissioner Mr. Khattar.

499
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:48,200
Me? I'm VK Sehgal!

500
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,280
Secretary to the Government of India.

501
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,560
Now retired.

502
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,040
Hey, Khattar. VK speaking.

503
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,160
How're you doing? Okay, listen.

504
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,720
I have a favor to ask.

505
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,440
I need you to investigate a guy.

506
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,690
Write the name down.

507
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,440
Mohit Chaddha.

508
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,400
Yes, Mohit Chadha.

509
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:11,560
Murder, rape, robbery, molesting

510
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:15,240
eve-teasing, rioting,
sending dirty texts

511
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:19,200
or any other public offense
or criminal activity...

512
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,360
Please report to me.

513
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,080
It's a matter of life and death for me.

514
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,490
Hello.

515
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:31,900
Yes, sir?

516
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,880
- Where are you?
- At the office.

517
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,160
Whose office?

518
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,920
Sir, my office.

519
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,400
Why are you whispering then?

520
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:40,080
Sir, I'm in a meeting. Let's talk later?

521
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,160
I'm retired, not jobless.

522
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,320
You think I have nothing better to do?

523
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,440
I'm a busy man, I have no time.

524
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,440
Okay, do one thing.

525
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,560
Give me your PAN card details.

526
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,720
Why do you need my PAN?

527
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,050
Why?

528
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:57,160
You want to marry my daughter.

529
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:00,880
I have full right to ask
for your PAN card details.

530
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,520
And if you don't have a PAN card

531
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:07,120
you have no right to marry my daughter.
Understood?

532
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,760
I'll give you my PAN card details.

533
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,040
I am giving it.

534
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:13,160
And your passport number, voter ID number

535
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,040
your car registration number

536
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:18,160
and most importantly,
your Aadhaar Card number.

537
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,400
- I want it all! Got it?
- Yes, sir.

538
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,720
Bring the photocopies of all documents

539
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,280
to the club this evening.

540
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:27,680
And remember,
without document verification

541
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,640
the marriage is canceled.

542
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,640
Sir, I was a Senior Executive
at Air Connect.

543
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,480
And they fired you.

544
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,840
I'm at least giving you a trainee's
position. You are not even thankful.

545
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,280
Where will you find a position
better than this now?

546
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:55,680
I will get much better.

547
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:01,360
Junior Manager, Global Assist,
salary Rs. 50,000.

548
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,800
Sales Manager, Bling Entertainment.

549
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,560
Salary Rs. 40,000.

550
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:08,360
Assistant Marketing Manager...

551
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:11,520
Inner Beauty, salary Rs. 85000 to 90,000.

552
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:14,400
Inner Beauty?
You mean lingerie and underwear?

553
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,560
No, no. I can't sell underwear.

554
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,800
- How much fuel, sir?
- Full.

555
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,120
What's wrong with selling lingerie?

556
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,040
Inner Beauty is offering a higher salary.

557
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,600
And before dad finds out...

558
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:29,040
I won't take any stupid decision
in fear of Osama.

559
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:32,240
And come on,
I am not selling bras and panties.

560
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,560
- It's Rs. 2865, sir.
- Here.

561
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,560
You know airlines are my thing.

562
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,690
It's just a matter of time.
I'll get a job. I'm good.

563
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,440
Looking hot! Shall I gobble you up?

564
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,240
Look, I will play two games of squash
with Osama

565
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,240
and let him win both.

566
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:06,380
Everything will be sorted.
I can handle him.

567
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,350
Sign, please.

568
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:28,240
We have firecrackers tied to our worries

569
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:31,880
Our spirits are free as kites

570
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,640
With willful determination

571
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:39,360
We take on our troubles head-on

572
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:43,000
We teach all the funsters

573
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:46,640
The meaning of fun

574
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:50,320
Our whole world is soaked and spoilt

575
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,320
With notes and coins

576
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,400
Our pockets are filled with good times

577
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:02,280
Our only wealth, good times

578
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:05,800
They strut, they shine, good times

579
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:09,480
They fly in style, good times

580
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:13,320
Good times, they're flying

581
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:19,250
just called an hour ago...
Mohit Chadda speaking...

582
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,920
The posters of dreams
Can be seen in the daylight

583
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:36,560
They are sold in markets
In colorful packets

584
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:40,280
If they are on sale

585
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:44,000
We'll even buy the moon and the stars

586
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:47,640
We make sense out of nonsense

587
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:51,400
We laugh at our sorrows

588
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:55,080
We are not alone in this game

589
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:59,640
The whole world is with us too

590
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:03,200
Our pockets are filled with good times

591
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:06,840
Our only wealth, good times

592
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:10,560
They strut, they shine, good times

593
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:14,200
They fly in style, good times

594
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:18,880
Good times, they are flying high

595
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:51,720
Why think of tomorrow?

596
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:55,840
Let's seize the day

597
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:59,640
The unseen days that we know not of

598
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:03,440
Why should we depend on them?

599
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:07,080
Not years,
Things happen in moments now

600
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:10,840
Like noodles, everything is instant.

601
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:14,560
Happiness is momentary
And comes for a brief period

602
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:18,680
All you have to do is ask for it

603
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:22,720
Our pockets are filled with good times

604
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,400
Our only wealth, good times

605
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:30,040
They strut, they shine, good times

606
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:33,600
They fly in style, good times

607
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:38,400
Good times, they fly high.

608
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:23,120
Mohit's father-in-law is coming.

609
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:26,320
Just pretend like Mohit still works here.
Okay?

610
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,440
Come on, move!

611
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:40,440
Move back, you! Hurry.

612
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:55,920
Come on! Move the car!

613
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:57,840
Move a little ahead.

614
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:00,200
- What's going on, man?
- Don't know, man.

615
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:04,080
What's going on?

616
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:07,000
Come on, aunt, leave.

617
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:09,680
Let go of me.

618
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,220
Get to the side.

619
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:29,280
Move on. What's the fight for?
Will you go?

620
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:30,560
I'm dead!

621
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:38,880
People came, people left.

622
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:41,160
But Mr Mohit stayed put in his seat.

623
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,160
I'm Mohit's best friend, Immy.

624
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:58,880
- Mohit's cubicle is that way...
- Not that way. Coffee is this way, sir.

625
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:01,440
Is it a lunch plan, sir?

626
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:05,280
Son-in-law and father-in-law, together?

627
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:09,000
The mad... the mad...
the mad son-in-law...

628
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:13,740
Isn't it funny?

629
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,880
Mohit is with the boss right now.

630
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:19,240
Why don't you come to my cubicle?

631
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:21,000
You like Chinese food?

632
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:27,520
Going somewhere, Mohit?

633
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:29,920
Or have you come to apologize?

634
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:32,840
Wasn't it here somewhere?

635
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:34,320
No, it's there.

636
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:36,240
Yes, this is it.

637
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:37,880
- And you're here.
- I am here.

638
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:41,590
I'll surely recommend
your name for a promotion.

639
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,010
No promotion, thanks.

640
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:46,900
I'm very happy in my cubicle.
Okay? So, bye.

641
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:49,320
Very irritating man.

642
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:51,720
- Let's talk. Come in.
- Sir, over lunch?

643
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,840
Fined three times for driving offenses?

644
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,640
Once for breaking a signal.

645
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,880
You always file your IT returns
after the due date.

646
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:16,280
Your US visa was refused
after the first attempt.

647
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:19,040
I'm sure something is wrong with you.

648
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,240
Otherwise one gets it
in the first attempt.

649
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:24,040
It's a detailed inquiry.

650
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:29,200
RTO file, IT, police inquiry,
passport office.

651
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:31,840
So many criminal cases are there.

652
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:34,480
How can I let my daughter marry you?

653
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:38,440
Did you do it all by yourself?

654
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:43,360
Obviously! It's a confidential matter.
What if it gets leaked?

655
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:46,400
You are so cool, sir!

656
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:51,040
Excuse me!
How did the government let you go?

657
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:56,000
It's a rule, retirement at sixty.

658
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:57,760
It's a damn useless rule, sir.

659
00:47:58,080 --> 00:47:59,720
At sixty a guy comes into his own.

660
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,800
There's a job opening in our company.

661
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,520
GM, Research and Analysis,
age limit is seventy.

662
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:06,920
- Seventy?
- Salary is 300,000.

663
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:08,880
Three-hundred thousand per annum?! Good.

664
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,720
You spoke just like a government official.

665
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:18,320
- Three-hundred thousand rupees per month?
- Yes.

666
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:27,400
Sir, you are an unutilised resource
of this country.

667
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:30,480
You are wasting the talent
and knowledge of VK Sehgal.

668
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:34,460
Sir, guide youngsters like me.
India needs you, sir.

669
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,240
You can win the Padma Shri,
the Padma Vibhushan.

670
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:41,120
I mean you can definitely
get Bharat Ratna.

671
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:43,920
You can't get Arjun Award
by playing squash, now.

672
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:49,040
Yes... I'm not going
to sit idle at home anyway.

673
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:52,600
I get many job offers.

674
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:56,160
There's an important task to finish.
I'll think about job after that.

675
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:04,320
Must be the machine. Try again.

676
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:07,040
The machine is fine, sir.

677
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:08,680
The transaction's not being approved.

678
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:10,640
Let me pay. I have my card.

679
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:12,240
No, sir, I have cash with me.

680
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:17,480
No, sir, I don't have cash.

681
00:49:17,510 --> 00:49:18,530
No cash?

682
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:20,320
Let me pay. Why are you creating a scene?

683
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:21,430
How much is it?

684
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,496
Two thousand rupees.
I'll withdraw and give it to you.

685
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:25,600
Two thousand! Here it is.

686
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:31,160
Who keeps so much cash nowadays?

687
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:37,000
How can Mayera be the daughter
of this terrorist?

688
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,280
Always ready to drop a bomb!

689
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:43,200
What?

690
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:14,080
I don't know, sir!
My credit card and ATM is not working.

691
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:16,920
What bank is your account in?

692
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:20,160
So you didn't get the money?

693
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:22,280
No.

694
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:23,720
Are you bankrupt?

695
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:27,920
So funny, sir. What a thing to say!
Bankrupt!

696
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:29,400
I'm in a hurry right now.

697
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:32,360
This matter of offenses is pending.

698
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:35,080
Of course!
I have to return your money too.

699
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:38,000
Squash at the club, this evening?

700
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:52,640
Yes, I will pay this month's EMI by check.

701
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,200
Fine! I will give you cash.

702
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:58,360
I'm telling you I will. Or else what?

703
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:00,840
You'll take the car away? Then do it!

704
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,720
Nothing much. Just needed some help.

705
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:22,120
- Here.
- How much is it?

706
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:23,280
Fifty thousand.

707
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:25,240
I asked for forty, right?

708
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:27,400
- Extra ten, pocket money.
- What pocket money?

709
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:29,080
Am I a kid?

710
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:31,040
Of course you're a kid!

711
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:33,440
You used all your money
and you didn't even know?

712
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:36,280
You should maintain detailed accounts.

713
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:38,120
I'll check at the end of each month.

714
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:39,680
What do you mean?

715
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:42,400
You mean I'm such a big idiot

716
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:44,200
that I won't find a job for months?

717
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,760
You surely will not
get anything in airlines.

718
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:49,040
I have mailed you a new job list.

719
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:51,080
The Inner Beauty position is still open.

720
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:54,120
If you get the job,
I will get free lingerie.

721
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:57,640
If I became a waiter,
you'll get free food.

722
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:02,120
On today's menu
we've plain paratha, plain butter

723
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:04,576
plain ghee, potato stuffed paratha,
potato butter, potato ghee.

724
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:06,376
Cauliflower stuffed paratha,
cauliflower butter, cauliflower ghee.

725
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:09,140
- Today's special is mix veg paratha.
- Shut up, you clown!

726
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:12,370
I have a meeting. I have to go.
Okay? Bye.

727
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:21,560
- Mayera?
- What is it?

728
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:25,640
What if I really become a waiter?

729
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:28,080
Standing at the cross-roads...

730
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:29,600
Will you marry a waiter?

731
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:32,720
When someone asks a question

732
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:37,000
You won't become a waiter.

733
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:39,120
You never know.

734
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:41,000
What if I have to?

735
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:46,360
Nothing seems real

736
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:48,000
Even then I'll marry you.

737
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:49,840
Now I really have to go, okay.

738
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:52,800
On these crossroads

739
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:59,800
Except imaginary indifference

740
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:37,120
Isn't it ironic that the man
who's keen on making you an orphan

741
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:39,760
you want to marry him?
How wonderful is that?

742
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:41,640
Please go and change, come on.

743
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:49,760
Taking out your frustrations on the ball?

744
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:52,520
I have tried all the companies
on your list.

745
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:55,600
Looks like I'll have to become a waiter
after all.

746
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:57,200
Your girlfriend is too good.

747
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:58,680
I've already made a new list.

748
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:01,000
Go and change now.

749
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:03,520
Okay, listen.

750
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:06,000
What is this "new job" story with dad?

751
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:07,760
"I'll take on a job too."

752
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:09,280
He kept on like that.

753
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:11,160
I've shut him up.

754
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:13,520
He's worked hard enough
for the last 35 years.

755
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:15,560
From home to office and back again.

756
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:18,680
He's worked so hard.
It's his time to relax now.

757
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:21,480
Is there even a need?
I can take care of him.

758
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:24,720
Don't allure him with
this 300,000 package.

759
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:28,920
Okay. Who's going to
hire him anyway?

760
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:35,000
- Mohit... Hey, Mohit!
- Sir...

761
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:36,520
I'm ready for a new job.

762
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:38,800
Mayera will not agree.

763
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:40,240
Who's going to tell her?

764
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:42,296
You frighten me all the time,
and now you'll lie yourself?

765
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:44,680
Nobody is going to lie, you fool.

766
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:46,880
When I get the job, we'll tell Mayera.

767
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:49,320
Till then start job hunting for me.

768
00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:50,410
Why should I?

769
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:52,680
Because it was your idea, you will do it.

770
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:55,080
No, sir, Mayera has categorically said no.

771
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:57,800
Okay, then the wedding is canceled.

772
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:11,800
Hey, Mohit.

773
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:14,720
Let's send the application
by registered post.

774
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:20,950
That way you'll never get a job.
Email, sir. Email.

775
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,760
The real problem is that I don't know
how to use a laptop.

776
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:29,600
It's the same as a computer.

777
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:31,520
I don't even know how to use computers!

778
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:35,000
You don't know to use a computer?

779
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:36,480
No! I don't.

780
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:38,240
You know how to make chicken biryani?

781
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:40,640
No, right? Just like that,
I don't know computers.

782
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:44,760
In that case, I've to search
for layman's jobs for you.

783
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:47,200
You called me a layman? Fool?

784
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:48,760
You bloody fool!

785
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:50,040
- Mayera!
- Where?

786
00:56:50,050 --> 00:56:51,130
Hello?

787
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:54,160
Yes, actually I'm in a meeting.

788
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:55,760
Yes, in an interview.

789
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:02,520
Stop right here.

790
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:04,200
- Here?
- Yes, yes, stop it.

791
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:06,400
- The house is ahead...
- You argue too much.

792
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,360
- Sir, but why?
- Again why!

793
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:13,400
Now, you go jump the wall,
then hide and cross the garden...

794
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:17,320
Yes hide, and come in
through my bedroom window.

795
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:18,880
Isn't this ironic?

796
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:21,800
Romeo hides from Juliet's
father and goes to meet her.

797
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:23,840
He doesn't hide from Juliet to go
meet her father.

798
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:26,680
- Does Radha work in Juliet's house?
- No!

799
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:28,720
Radha'll see Romeo and inform Juliet.

800
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:30,000
Juliet will ask her father

801
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:33,720
about why Romeobunked his office
to roam with her father.

802
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:35,920
- Logical!
- So, do it.

803
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:39,520
Let me send Radha out for some work.

804
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:41,400
Then I'll signal you to come inside.

805
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:52,520
- Radha, Radha!
- Yes, sir.

806
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:53,920
Come here.

807
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:57,120
A few of my shirts and pants are lying
outside the cupboard.

808
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:00,400
Take them to the washerwoman
and get them ironed nicely.

809
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:03,720
And don't come back till they're all done,
even if takes an hour.

810
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:05,120
But Shah Rukh's film is on TV...

811
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:06,800
Hey, don't talk nonsense.

812
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:09,400
Stay with the washerwoman
till the job is done.

813
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:15,040
What can I say. I'll miss the film.

814
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:16,920
There's always so much work here.

815
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:19,200
- Have you seen it?
- Not yet.

816
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:21,560
Oh, you haven't?

817
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:23,760
I'm crazy about Shah Rukh.

818
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:25,360
But ever since sir retired

819
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:27,120
he just doesn't let go off the remote.

820
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:36,160
It's you guys, not us.

821
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:39,950
Immy's record-breaking relationship...
Two months and still going strong?

822
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:41,880
Yes!

823
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,840
Just when Mohit lost his job,
Swati came into my life.

824
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:47,520
What? Will everything be with reference
to my job now?

825
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,920
Bad mood?
Come on, show us your dimples, man.

826
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:54,560
Smile with your dimples.

827
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:10,360
I'm on antibiotics.

828
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:11,680
Do you have flu?

829
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:16,800
Sir, if my girlfriend
would tell me so lovingly...

830
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:18,040
What would you do, huh?

831
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:19,360
Shower in rum and coke?

832
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:21,920
Go, shower.

833
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:32,560
Why do you keep ranting
about paying all the time?

834
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:34,400
I don't want it, that's it!

835
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:35,840
Is there some compulsion?

836
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:43,440
Okay, no compulsions. Sorry.

837
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:03,560
Rock show on 25th and we're both going.

838
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:05,040
On Rs. 5,000 tickets?

839
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:09,000
I'll pay. You can return the money
when you find a job!

840
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:11,000
By then I'll be a bus conductor.

841
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:12,440
Better if you find someone else.

842
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:17,720
Then I'll be the bus driver
and will kidnap you and your bus forever.

843
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,760
And what if I become an ice-cream seller?

844
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:22,560
Then I'll buy the van.

845
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:25,600
And I'll gobble up all the ice-cream,
and you!

846
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:27,080
That's my job to gobble up.

847
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:30,060
What about an auto-rickshaw driver?

848
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:31,690
Then I'll be the traffic cop.

849
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:35,000
I'll issue you a ticket
and lock you up in my jail for life.

850
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:38,920
What if I land up being a postman?

851
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:45,000
Needlessly, you make and break

852
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:49,640
Needlessly...

853
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:55,040
You count each penny

854
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:58,920
Without any reason

855
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:04,920
You're afraid of love

856
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:08,360
Without any reason

857
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,800
You push me away

858
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:15,480
My love...

859
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:28,360
Needlessly, you make and break

860
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:31,080
Needlessly, you count each penny

861
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:33,720
Needlessly you're afraid of love

862
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:36,440
Needlessly you push me honey

863
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:38,800
I'm the heroine of your every story

864
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:42,040
I'm the happy ending

865
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:49,840
The moment a storm came
You packed up your things

866
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:52,200
And left for good from my heart

867
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:55,080
If I couldn't pay the rent
Of your heart, my dear

868
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:57,520
You would throw me out anyway

869
01:01:57,600 --> 01:02:02,800
It was a promise for ever after
When the deal was made

870
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:08,440
When my pockets are empty,
How can I repay the debt I have raised!

871
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:13,520
I will stake my claim
And take you home

872
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:19,120
Let me prove my worth
Then only there'll be profit

873
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:21,840
Needlessly, you make promises of love...

874
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:24,480
Needlessly, you raise your hopes

875
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:27,080
Needlessly, you dream crazy girl

876
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:29,800
Without any reason our story's done

877
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:32,160
I'm the heroine of your every story

878
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:35,200
I'm the happy ending

879
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:53,920
If you were booze,
I'd gulp you down

880
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:57,760
I'd be the addiction itself

881
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:01,640
I'd be the cloud,
To stay with you

882
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:05,520
If you became my sky!

883
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:09,880
Sweet to the ears...

884
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Not easy to do

885
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:15,160
To turn yourself into
Someone else's dream

886
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:17,600
It's not easy to do

887
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:20,200
Hues pale away

888
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:23,160
Only love remains...

889
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:25,920
Everyone else changes

890
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:28,680
Except red, orange,
yellow, blue and green

891
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:31,240
Needlessly, counting pennies

892
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:33,920
Needlessly, being calculative

893
01:03:34,040 --> 01:03:36,560
Without any reason
You are being afraid of love

894
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:39,280
Without any reason
You are pushing me away

895
01:03:39,360 --> 01:03:41,640
I'm the heroine of your every story

896
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:44,560
I'm the happy ending

897
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:46,240
Needlessly...

898
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:49,040
Needlessly...

899
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:51,560
Needlessly...

900
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:54,480
Needlessly...

901
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:57,680
I'm the heroine of your every story

902
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:01,120
I'm the happy ending
Of your every tale

903
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:29,600
Not bad, Mr. Sehgal!

904
01:04:30,140 --> 01:04:31,990
You must've thought of an email ID.

905
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:34,440
- Vinod Kumar Sehgal.
- No, it's too long.

906
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:56,560
Wow! So many jobs?

907
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:58,200
Yes, but around 80% are useless.

908
01:04:58,640 --> 01:04:59,920
What is this now?

909
01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:01,440
It's a game... just...

910
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:04,680
Move then... move, move.

911
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:06,600
Start it, please.

912
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:08,800
Just press 'enter' and click.

913
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:10,280
Oh! Cool!

914
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:22,920
I killed the damn guy!
Super cool game, man.

915
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,080
Okay, do one thing.
Let's see how you play!

916
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:27,240
- Me, sir?
- Play this game.

917
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:28,920
Tell me something...

918
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:32,080
You come here every other day
giving excuses as client meeting.

919
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:33,720
I won't come from tomorrow then.

920
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:35,840
No, no... l was just asking...

921
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:38,560
My job shouldn't create
problems for your job.

922
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:40,800
My job?

923
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:43,830
There won't be any problem.
Don't worry.

924
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:45,870
Radha!

925
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:48,600
Take your coat, come on.

926
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:51,360
Coming, coming... have patience!

927
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:54,240
What took you so long, sir?

928
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:55,480
What were you doing?

929
01:05:56,920 --> 01:05:58,760
We're an insurance company, Mr. Chaddha

930
01:05:58,840 --> 01:06:01,160
and your experience
is in airlines marketing.

931
01:06:01,410 --> 01:06:04,840
- It won't work for us.
- Sir, just give me a chance.

932
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:07,480
Not just insurance,
I can even market the Qutub Minar!

933
01:06:07,640 --> 01:06:08,720
Qutub Minar!?

934
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:10,440
It's not that easy, Mr. Chaddha.

935
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:13,100
It's the era of specialization.
Thank you for coming.

936
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:18,240
You just give me the job.
I will become a specialist.

937
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:20,400
You become a specialist,
we'll give you the job.

938
01:06:20,900 --> 01:06:23,640
Please, sir,
I am asking for just one chance.

939
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:28,920
I was an MBA topper.
I'll prove it to you, sir!

940
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:31,740
- I'll work really hard, sir!
- Mohit Chaddha!

941
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:33,800
Are you begging for the job now?

942
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:50,560
Only six tickets are left.
Should I book tickets for you and Mohit?

943
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:52,120
Yeah, book them!

944
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:55,240
You ditched us the last time.

945
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:56,800
Seven hundred rupees were wasted.

946
01:06:57,120 --> 01:06:58,480
Confirm and tell us, Mayera.

947
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:19,520
- 18:30 movie?
- I can't come.

948
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:21,560
Why, what are you doing?

949
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:24,360
Everyone is going.

950
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:26,920
Everyone is so worried about my job.

951
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:29,280
That's why I've come for this interview.

952
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:30,600
To end everyone's worries.

953
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:33,480
So I should avoid watching
the movie with everyone

954
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:35,240
and focus on my interview.

955
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:38,280
I'm sure everyone will understand.

956
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:42,240
Mohit, these are your friends.
That's why they're worrying.

957
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:44,080
There's no need to be so sarcastic.

958
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:51,480
Anyway, no chance for the 18:30 show,
right?

959
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:53,690
No chance.

960
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:55,440
There are around ten, eleven candidates.

961
01:07:55,600 --> 01:07:58,240
The interviews are extensive, in-depth.

962
01:07:58,320 --> 01:07:59,720
In case it gets over earlier...

963
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:01,240
Damn it! I said there's no chance.

964
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:04,000
Okay... best of luck.

965
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:45,480
- Hi, sir.
- Hi.

966
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:47,640
Mayera is in her room.

967
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:55,280
Mohit! Mohit.

968
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:02,840
Did you email my application properly?

969
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:03,920
There's no reply.

970
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:05,400
You'll get a response soon.

971
01:09:05,480 --> 01:09:07,360
- Wait one second.
- It's her birthday.

972
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:10,480
Assault mission game! Cool, huh?

973
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:12,040
Where did you get this from?

974
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:13,400
Palika market. Six hundred.

975
01:09:13,480 --> 01:09:15,616
You could have told me.
I could have got you this for half.

976
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:18,800
Your guy wouldn't even
get the cover for three fifty.

977
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:20,720
I have a reliable source in Palika.

978
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:38,240
How do I look?

979
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:40,440
Super hot! Shall I gobble you up?

980
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,200
What did you get for me?

981
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:15,700
That's it?

982
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:19,320
How could I get a gift
with the borrowed money?

983
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:22,600
It's my birthday!

984
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:25,100
I wasn't expecting a diamond necklace.

985
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:26,520
Just a rose would've done.

986
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:30,400
You have pocket money after all.

987
01:10:32,280 --> 01:10:35,000
Open the door,
or else we'll break it down!

988
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:43,280
Happy birthday to you!

989
01:10:46,680 --> 01:10:48,400
Open the gift.

990
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:13,800
Your check bounced again.

991
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:15,920
The landlord's fuming.

992
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:18,440
Arrange for the rent today somehow.

993
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:20,080
Dude, please help me out.

994
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:21,560
I'll arrange it by next week.

995
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:23,800
Dude, you haven't
given the last one either.

996
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:26,760
I need cash badly.
Please return my cash as well.

997
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:30,320
You know what, forget it.

998
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:32,440
Just arrange for this month's rent.

999
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:36,240
And Mohit, bro,
do something about your job.

1000
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:38,760
I'm working on it, I am.

1001
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:41,400
What is it, huh?
You're busy flying high in the air!

1002
01:11:41,480 --> 01:11:44,560
Come back to earth, bro,
accept a job in a lower position.

1003
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:45,880
Why should I?

1004
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:49,280
I'm an MBA for God's sake.
Top of my batch.

1005
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:50,880
And who got promoted, you or me?

1006
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,640
I was, and because of that
promotion, you still have your job.

1007
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:56,320
Is this how I have to return the favor?
By paying rent?

1008
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:06,080
Maybe you've started enjoying
being unemployed.

1009
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:09,680
You want your money? You'll get it.
Now, just get lost!

1010
01:12:12,680 --> 01:12:14,200
I don't have fifteen thousand.

1011
01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:16,000
I spent a lot this month.

1012
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,160
I got a new dress. There's the party.

1013
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:23,920
Your car EMI, credit card bill,
your phone bill and pocket money...

1014
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:28,000
So, I've to listen to the list now?

1015
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:30,360
If you had told me
about the rent in advance

1016
01:12:30,440 --> 01:12:31,976
I wouldn't have
bought the rock show tickets.

1017
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,330
Tickets for the rock show?

1018
01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:36,480
Did I ask you for that?

1019
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:46,120
I would've sacrificed this too
if I knew it before.

1020
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:51,000
- Sacrifice? Are you insane?
- Yes, sacrifice.

1021
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:55,320
You don't realize at all. I haven't bought
a new pair of sandals these two months.

1022
01:12:58,720 --> 01:13:02,160
I gained two kilos with
your pizzas and oily omelets.

1023
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:04,520
I work hard so that I can enjoy my life.

1024
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:07,120
But thanks to you,
leave alone malls and night-clubs

1025
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:09,440
I even forgot
the smell of multiplex popcorn!

1026
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:15,040
It's one rock show that I wanted
to go to and even for that...

1027
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:18,040
Mayera, one rock show!
It's just a rock show!

1028
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:20,200
You should be given a Nobel Prize!

1029
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:22,240
Somebody, please, give her a Nobel Prize.

1030
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:24,440
A half sensible person
would've understood.

1031
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:28,280
Why prize? I'll give you your money back.
Don't stress, I'll settle everything!

1032
01:13:34,120 --> 01:13:36,000
Yes, of course! And you're Mother India!

1033
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:41,040
I said I'll return it.

1034
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:43,600
I don't want to sit
in your dirty rotten car!

1035
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:52,200
Get lost, bye. And never sit in it again!

1036
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:02,920
Going somewhere, ma'am?

1037
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:04,200
What do you want? Move ahead!

1038
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:08,480
Hey, rickshaw... rickshaw.

1039
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:27,160
There is a vacancy...
I would like to welcome...

1040
01:14:36,280 --> 01:14:37,760
Sir, it's a car not a bicycle.

1041
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:39,200
A latest model.

1042
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:42,400
No dent, no scratch,
hasn't run even a thousand miles.

1043
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:45,120
Your quotation is a shame for me.

1044
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:48,760
Make an offer I can't refuse.

1045
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:52,120
The car is in your garage
as soon as the money is in your pocket!

1046
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:54,080
Or else I can go to Mr. Bhalla.

1047
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:56,200
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, Mohit?

1048
01:14:56,360 --> 01:14:58,360
I've called to inform you

1049
01:14:58,760 --> 01:15:01,760
that finally, I got a call
for an interview.

1050
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:04,840
They had to. The application
was filed so neatly.

1051
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:06,520
Neatly means nothing.

1052
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:10,720
My five page, mind-blowing bio-data
must have impressed them.

1053
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:14,000
Anyway, reach home quickly.
We have to prepare for the interview.

1054
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:15,920
No, sir, not now. There's an emergency.

1055
01:15:16,040 --> 01:15:17,240
Is there?

1056
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:19,520
If you can't come,
I'll come to your office.

1057
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:20,680
No, no...

1058
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:22,760
You don't have to. Let me see.

1059
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:24,840
Good, come by 17:00.

1060
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:29,040
And listen... thank you for all.

1061
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:31,240
Okay then.

1062
01:15:33,530 --> 01:15:34,599
Yes, Dad?

1063
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:36,640
Mayera, come home early today.

1064
01:15:36,670 --> 01:15:37,740
But...

1065
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:40,600
Look, have I ever asked you
to come home early? No, right!

1066
01:15:40,680 --> 01:15:44,920
But today please reach home by 18:00.
Otherwise, I'll never speak to you again.

1067
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:46,880
18:00 means 18:00. Bye, bye-bye.

1068
01:15:47,240 --> 01:15:48,400
Radha!

1069
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:50,080
- Oh, Radha?
- Yes, sir?

1070
01:15:50,160 --> 01:15:52,640
Order two chicken from the meat shop.

1071
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:55,040
And prepare the biryani spices.

1072
01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:56,800
Mohit and Mayera will have dinner.

1073
01:15:56,880 --> 01:15:58,440
- All right!
- Make halva as well.

1074
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:01,520
Gursharan? You know PC Jewelers, right?

1075
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,240
Can you get me a discount?

1076
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:05,120
So meet me there!

1077
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:07,880
At the South Ex showroom, in an hour.

1078
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:21,400
Study the detailed account date wise.

1079
01:16:21,480 --> 01:16:24,096
There is 5,000 extra. Just in case,
if there's a mistake in the calculaton.

1080
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:27,240
Mail me if it is more than 5,000.
I'll send you a draft.

1081
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:32,760
Where is the damn accounts slip?

1082
01:16:33,320 --> 01:16:34,340
It's okay.

1083
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:36,040
I'll make a fresh one.

1084
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:37,640
I remember everything.

1085
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:53,080
What impression would I create
on my son-in-law with such rings?

1086
01:16:54,120 --> 01:16:57,080
Show me a good one,
not these flimsy things.

1087
01:16:57,160 --> 01:17:00,720
Ma'am? Mr. Sehgal is Secretary
to Government of India, IAS.

1088
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:03,520
Show him something of his worth.
Call the owner.

1089
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:05,040
No, sir. I'm showing.

1090
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:06,320
Take a look at this.

1091
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:08,880
Look at this, sir.

1092
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:10,950
Matching rings for the bride and groom.

1093
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:12,680
These are single diamonds, right?

1094
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:14,120
- What's the name?
- Solitaire.

1095
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:16,200
Solitaire. solitaire. They are good.

1096
01:17:16,280 --> 01:17:19,640
This will cost you around 450,000.

1097
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:24,320
No! That's a little too much.
Show something reasonable.

1098
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:26,400
No, please pack these.

1099
01:17:27,480 --> 01:17:28,570
Here you are.

1100
01:17:30,110 --> 01:17:31,240
Please check.

1101
01:17:31,320 --> 01:17:33,600
I added the stupid rock show tickets too.

1102
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:37,840
Guess everything is cleared between us.

1103
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:39,860
All clear.

1104
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:42,280
The rock show's stupid,
because it's my plan.

1105
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:44,840
And being a cry-baby
and staying at home is very clever.

1106
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:48,080
I'm okay as stupid.

1107
01:17:49,130 --> 01:17:52,320
You know what? Clever and stupid
shouldn't get married either.

1108
01:17:56,240 --> 01:17:58,880
As if I want to get married.

1109
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:02,600
In any case, I can't afford the stupidity
of love and marriage anymore.

1110
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:06,600
This boy that Mayera has chosen...

1111
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:10,040
His market value may be less
but his character is priceless.

1112
01:18:10,120 --> 01:18:12,760
In my humble opinion,
character is the only value, sir.

1113
01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:17,480
Today when I got the interview mail,
I thought I've tested this boy enough.

1114
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:20,260
I should agree to their marriage.

1115
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:24,760
But Mohit should never know
I was praising him.

1116
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:28,530
- Don't let praise go to your head.
- Top secret, sir.

1117
01:18:29,720 --> 01:18:33,080
Now even this expensive ring
seems reasonable for him.

1118
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:42,480
Actually, there isn't any point
in meeting again.

1119
01:18:42,680 --> 01:18:44,920
As if! I've just come to return the money.

1120
01:18:57,360 --> 01:18:59,240
In fact, I was going to say it first.

1121
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:04,240
You're first and I came last. Happy?

1122
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:18,950
This is my office, Mohit.
You get lost.

1123
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:21,520
Your office, your money.

1124
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:27,480
Why do all answers

1125
01:19:27,560 --> 01:19:30,920
Seem fickle and dubious?

1126
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:37,080
Nothing seems real

1127
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:41,720
On these crossroads

1128
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:47,680
Except for an imaginary indifference

1129
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:54,640
Except for an imaginary indifference

1130
01:19:58,160 --> 01:20:02,040
Except for an imaginary indifference

1131
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:19,320
Here's the entire history of the company.

1132
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:21,200
Put away the games and read it.

1133
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:23,040
Why should I read about them?

1134
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:25,600
Are they taking my interview
or am I taking theirs?

1135
01:20:26,720 --> 01:20:28,640
I did my complete homework on you

1136
01:20:28,720 --> 01:20:30,616
before I came and asked
for your permission for marriage.

1137
01:20:30,640 --> 01:20:33,040
So that I don't say anything wrong.

1138
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:36,360
Wow! You're very cool.

1139
01:20:37,680 --> 01:20:40,200
- Okay, I'm leaving now.
- Wait, wait.

1140
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:43,120
- Let's have a beer.
- I have to go to work.

1141
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:45,560
Beer is just a cold drink.

1142
01:20:45,640 --> 01:20:47,320
No cold drink before the interview.

1143
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:49,320
Load the game then.

1144
01:20:49,400 --> 01:20:50,880
I'll just come. Load the game.

1145
01:20:52,600 --> 01:20:54,480
Now where's this Mayera?

1146
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:56,560
- Must be on her way.
- It's 18:00 already.

1147
01:20:56,640 --> 01:20:58,320
I told her to come early.

1148
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:00,640
I can't make Mohit wait that long.

1149
01:21:00,720 --> 01:21:03,240
Great! The smell of the halva
is irresistible.

1150
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:04,680
The thing is, son,

1151
01:21:04,760 --> 01:21:07,200
this is not a chilled beer.
It's a child beer.

1152
01:21:11,480 --> 01:21:12,880
We're here, Mayera.

1153
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:14,600
Where are you off to?

1154
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:16,640
Mohit?

1155
01:21:19,030 --> 01:21:21,640
What the hell?
What are you doing here?

1156
01:21:22,640 --> 01:21:25,200
- I... I...
- Hey, you Romeo.

1157
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:28,000
Your Juliet is here.
Leave the window and come in.

1158
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:29,840
- Dad, please...
- Nobody will speak.

1159
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:33,400
- Radha!
- Radha is at home?

1160
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:34,720
Where else would she be?

1161
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:39,240
Come on, Mohit. Show some enthusiasm.

1162
01:21:40,720 --> 01:21:43,160
Sit down, both of you!

1163
01:21:43,560 --> 01:21:44,760
Congratulations, sir.

1164
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:47,040
Miss Mayera?

1165
01:21:52,360 --> 01:21:55,760
Surprise... Congratulations.

1166
01:21:56,600 --> 01:21:59,240
One for you and one for you.

1167
01:22:00,360 --> 01:22:02,560
Take it. Shall I keep on standing?

1168
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:08,840
Now tell me. Do you like it? How is it?

1169
01:22:09,160 --> 01:22:10,310
The rings?

1170
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:12,280
What is it?

1171
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:16,440
Someone say something.

1172
01:22:18,440 --> 01:22:20,760
This is the report card of your probation.

1173
01:22:20,920 --> 01:22:23,280
You're not perfect, but we'll manage!

1174
01:22:25,720 --> 01:22:27,560
Now before I change my mind,

1175
01:22:27,640 --> 01:22:29,880
exchange your rings.

1176
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:38,420
What's wrong?

1177
01:22:38,840 --> 01:22:40,760
They're solitaires.

1178
01:22:41,680 --> 01:22:43,000
Don't you like the design?

1179
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:45,320
At least, just wear them for ceremony.

1180
01:22:45,680 --> 01:22:47,640
Tomorrow you can go select your own.

1181
01:22:47,660 --> 01:22:48,700
All right?

1182
01:22:48,720 --> 01:22:51,560
So who wears the ring first,
the boy or the girl?

1183
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:55,360
Why are you laughing?

1184
01:22:55,560 --> 01:22:57,040
Dad, we're not getting married.

1185
01:23:00,230 --> 01:23:05,000
- She's serious.
- It's over between us.

1186
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:09,120
Hey... sit, sit down!

1187
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:14,880
Did I simply play all this squash?
Sweat away?

1188
01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:17,200
Made inquiries in various departments?

1189
01:23:19,320 --> 01:23:21,920
And do you know how many
phone calls, photocopies,

1190
01:23:22,040 --> 01:23:25,240
plastic files I've spent on...
on your Mohit?

1191
01:23:26,310 --> 01:23:27,350
Not mine.

1192
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:28,390
Not mine?

1193
01:23:28,430 --> 01:23:31,240
Now I'm not going to investigate
any other boy.

1194
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:35,240
Talk to each other
and figure out a solution.

1195
01:23:35,640 --> 01:23:38,160
Say sorry, and exchange rings.

1196
01:23:38,450 --> 01:23:42,840
- Dad, it's impossible. It's a huge gap.
- Requires a lot of money!

1197
01:23:42,920 --> 01:23:44,760
Which your daughter has, but I don't.

1198
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:47,720
Who fights over money?

1199
01:23:49,320 --> 01:23:51,480
Did you borrow money from him? Return it.

1200
01:23:52,520 --> 01:23:54,680
If I had money then only she would borrow,
right?

1201
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:56,920
I haven't had a salary for three months.

1202
01:23:57,660 --> 01:24:02,680
And the fact is... I'm unemployed.
I'm looking for a job.

1203
01:24:02,760 --> 01:24:05,160
You lost your airlines' job?

1204
01:24:09,080 --> 01:24:11,440
You lost it then itself, right?

1205
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:12,560
I knew it.

1206
01:24:12,640 --> 01:24:14,200
- You lied to me?
- Yes.

1207
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:15,840
I lied to you.

1208
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:17,920
Now tell me, should I?

1209
01:24:18,040 --> 01:24:19,160
Like hell you will!

1210
01:24:19,240 --> 01:24:21,080
You've failed, for sure.

1211
01:24:21,160 --> 01:24:23,800
- You've lied.
- And you're Gandhi!

1212
01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:25,360
You lied to Mayera too.

1213
01:24:26,040 --> 01:24:27,130
What lying?

1214
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:30,320
I'm trying for a job. He's helping me.

1215
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:32,280
Was helping me... was!

1216
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:35,120
You promised me.

1217
01:24:46,840 --> 01:24:48,120
Miss, halva.

1218
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:54,480
Please forget about the job, okay?

1219
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:57,160
Mohit's gone. New job search is also gone.

1220
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:25,560
Sir, is the Dubai position still open?

1221
01:25:26,160 --> 01:25:27,920
You took too long, silly.

1222
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:36,120
He's joining next week.

1223
01:25:36,360 --> 01:25:37,920
If you can go before that...

1224
01:25:38,120 --> 01:25:39,480
Can you leave tonight?

1225
01:25:39,680 --> 01:25:41,520
The travel desk will arrange the visa.

1226
01:25:46,760 --> 01:25:49,800
If you can convince them there,
I'll get all the approvals here.

1227
01:25:49,880 --> 01:25:51,760
Once you get the appointment in Dubai,

1228
01:25:52,040 --> 01:25:54,480
come back over
the weekend to shift properly.

1229
01:25:57,640 --> 01:26:00,920
For now, this is between us.
This is just a regular assignment.

1230
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:33,120
What's going on?

1231
01:26:35,480 --> 01:26:38,280
Hello, sir. I'm Nawab Master,
the driving instructor.

1232
01:26:38,440 --> 01:26:40,240
I also sell secondhand cars.

1233
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:43,760
I sold Mr. Mohit"s car
at a good price just yesterday.

1234
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:45,560
Call me if you have anything.

1235
01:26:51,360 --> 01:26:53,120
Accounts are all settled now.

1236
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:54,200
Where are you going?

1237
01:26:54,280 --> 01:26:56,720
Today they are.
Tomorrow they'll be unsettled again.

1238
01:26:57,680 --> 01:27:00,280
I actually might start
enjoying being unemployed.

1239
01:27:01,480 --> 01:27:04,800
Murit, sorry...
I swear I'll never read your newspaper.

1240
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:06,200
I'll never watch Big Boss.

1241
01:27:06,280 --> 01:27:08,240
I'll buy you beer for a month.

1242
01:27:08,320 --> 01:27:11,040
You can have my entire Playboy collection!
The remote as well!

1243
01:27:39,680 --> 01:27:41,760
You make your heart understand

1244
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:43,840
You make fool out of yourself

1245
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:46,840
And carry on with the misreading

1246
01:27:48,160 --> 01:27:50,200
Something which is not broken

1247
01:27:50,280 --> 01:27:52,320
Someone who's not angry at you

1248
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:56,320
Even then it hurts so much

1249
01:27:56,720 --> 01:27:58,840
False concessions...

1250
01:27:58,920 --> 01:28:01,000
Fake confessions...

1251
01:28:01,080 --> 01:28:04,640
It hides all your mistakes.

1252
01:28:05,200 --> 01:28:07,320
It fools everyone

1253
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:09,400
And blames itself

1254
01:28:09,480 --> 01:28:14,120
Looks for gain even in losses

1255
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:19,760
All this silliness...

1256
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,080
Meaningless and pointless

1257
01:28:22,280 --> 01:28:24,160
Needless and thoughtless...

1258
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:27,560
Unnecessary silliness...

1259
01:28:27,640 --> 01:28:32,560
All this silliness...

1260
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:34,640
Meaningless and pointless

1261
01:28:34,720 --> 01:28:36,800
Needless and thoughtless...

1262
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:40,720
Unnecessary silliness...

1263
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:55,440
There isn't any position open.

1264
01:28:55,680 --> 01:28:57,560
Why don't you leave your resume behind?

1265
01:29:01,360 --> 01:29:02,720
Okay. All the best.

1266
01:29:10,920 --> 01:29:13,000
In a still high temperature

1267
01:29:13,080 --> 01:29:15,080
You show no improvement

1268
01:29:15,160 --> 01:29:19,360
You fall on your face time and again

1269
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:21,400
There's still time

1270
01:29:21,480 --> 01:29:23,560
Not all is lost

1271
01:29:23,640 --> 01:29:28,040
Why wear a long face then?

1272
01:29:28,120 --> 01:29:32,200
You spend your days cursing others

1273
01:29:32,280 --> 01:29:35,880
Such stubbornness!

1274
01:29:36,640 --> 01:29:40,640
Someone must stop you

1275
01:29:40,720 --> 01:29:44,720
How long will you fool yourself?

1276
01:29:47,240 --> 01:29:49,080
Meet Mohit, our new counter manager.

1277
01:29:55,920 --> 01:29:58,000
Meaningless and pointless

1278
01:29:58,080 --> 01:30:00,040
Needless and thoughtless...

1279
01:30:00,120 --> 01:30:02,760
Unnecessary silliness...

1280
01:30:02,840 --> 01:30:04,840
Super hot! Shall I just gobble you up?

1281
01:30:04,920 --> 01:30:08,240
Silliness...

1282
01:30:08,600 --> 01:30:10,720
Meaningless and pointless

1283
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:12,800
Needless and thoughtless...

1284
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:16,840
Unnecessary silliness...

1285
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:56,920
It's actually easy

1286
01:30:57,040 --> 01:31:01,160
To gather and fix the broken parts

1287
01:31:01,240 --> 01:31:05,400
Fret not, fear not

1288
01:31:05,480 --> 01:31:09,600
Just utter the sounds of sorry

1289
01:31:09,680 --> 01:31:11,760
Why are you faking?

1290
01:31:11,840 --> 01:31:13,800
Posturing and raving?

1291
01:31:13,880 --> 01:31:18,000
What can you gain from this?

1292
01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:20,200
What to calculate now?

1293
01:31:20,280 --> 01:31:22,200
Why weigh things so much?

1294
01:31:22,280 --> 01:31:27,120
What would you lose and win?

1295
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:32,720
All this silliness...

1296
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:34,800
Meaningless and pointless

1297
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:36,880
Needless and thoughtless...

1298
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:40,360
Unnecessary silliness...

1299
01:31:40,440 --> 01:31:45,240
Silliness...

1300
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:47,560
Meaningless and pointless

1301
01:31:47,640 --> 01:31:49,680
Needless and thoughtless...

1302
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:54,320
Unnecessary silliness...

1303
01:32:05,400 --> 01:32:07,760
Negi, who are those couples
at table three and twelve?

1304
01:32:08,240 --> 01:32:10,360
It's been three hours now.

1305
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:12,680
- Get them out!
- They're penniless lovers.

1306
01:32:12,760 --> 01:32:14,440
Where will they go for their love-talk?

1307
01:32:15,320 --> 01:32:18,560
Parents at home, police in the parks.

1308
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:20,800
They're not making any scene, sir.

1309
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:22,200
Why get into the business of love

1310
01:32:23,360 --> 01:32:24,680
if they're penniless!

1311
01:32:25,880 --> 01:32:27,520
Yes, sir. Boss's order after all.

1312
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:29,040
Let's shoo them away.

1313
01:32:30,920 --> 01:32:32,200
Put that stick aside.

1314
01:32:32,280 --> 01:32:34,240
Give them a cappuccino each.

1315
01:32:34,520 --> 01:32:36,160
But, no free business after this.

1316
01:32:36,600 --> 01:32:38,280
They'll have to spend to sit here.

1317
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:39,840
Or else, out in an hour.

1318
01:32:40,120 --> 01:32:42,360
You're touched too, right, sir?

1319
01:32:42,440 --> 01:32:43,600
Yes, bro, really!

1320
01:32:43,680 --> 01:32:46,120
- Brownies too, sir?
- Shall I throw you out too?

1321
01:32:47,320 --> 01:32:49,120
What's this, sir? Be happy.

1322
01:32:51,080 --> 01:32:52,800
Hey, you're back!

1323
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:55,200
Sir, this is Manju.

1324
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:57,760
She went to Rohtak
for her cousin's wedding.

1325
01:32:58,320 --> 01:32:59,520
This is our Mohit sir.

1326
01:33:01,600 --> 01:33:02,720
Sir, I'll just be back.

1327
01:33:04,840 --> 01:33:07,480
Sir, Manju is my girlfriend.

1328
01:33:09,640 --> 01:33:10,750
I can see that.

1329
01:33:11,240 --> 01:33:13,000
Now I'll enjoy my work.

1330
01:33:14,600 --> 01:33:17,920
Don't mind, but your
professional story is very sad.

1331
01:33:18,200 --> 01:33:20,360
But there's an easy solution
for your love story.

1332
01:33:20,520 --> 01:33:24,080
- Just by by saying sorry to each other.
- By God, Manju...

1333
01:33:24,320 --> 01:33:26,600
Her mother calls her "Big-mouth Manju".

1334
01:33:26,880 --> 01:33:28,600
I'm never gonna tell you anything.

1335
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:30,640
I'm sorry I told her, sir.

1336
01:33:30,720 --> 01:33:32,280
And no one else.

1337
01:33:32,360 --> 01:33:34,160
It's her fault. She should say sorry.

1338
01:33:34,240 --> 01:33:37,600
- But, sir, just try once. Talk to her.
- Manju, he's in a bad mood, come.

1339
01:33:37,680 --> 01:33:39,640
Let me just talk to him for a second...

1340
01:33:46,400 --> 01:33:47,680
That liar!

1341
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:49,120
That jobless...

1342
01:33:49,720 --> 01:33:52,760
Been dependent on Mayera
for the last two months!

1343
01:33:54,520 --> 01:33:56,520
I should have sent him to jail!

1344
01:33:57,680 --> 01:33:59,640
Don't know why I'm so confused about him.

1345
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:02,440
Sir, the government never
respected your work, your honesty.

1346
01:34:02,600 --> 01:34:03,840
Transfer upon transfer.

1347
01:34:04,200 --> 01:34:05,800
But God is watching.

1348
01:34:06,120 --> 01:34:09,360
He saved you
and our Mayera at the last minute.

1349
01:34:09,440 --> 01:34:10,840
No more scope for confusion.

1350
01:34:12,280 --> 01:34:15,120
Tell that ma'am to finish up the bill.

1351
01:34:15,200 --> 01:34:17,120
Be patient, sir. Patient.

1352
01:34:17,720 --> 01:34:19,280
But there's one thing.

1353
01:34:19,360 --> 01:34:23,000
Even after breaking up with Mayera,
he went out of his way to help you.

1354
01:34:23,080 --> 01:34:25,520
Logically, it doesn't add up.

1355
01:34:26,480 --> 01:34:28,200
I think it's a big conspiracy, sir.

1356
01:34:29,240 --> 01:34:33,000
In my humble opinion,
pull some strings and send him to jail.

1357
01:34:37,080 --> 01:34:41,280
It's your lucky day, sir.
Gold prices have shot up.

1358
01:34:41,440 --> 01:34:45,440
You've made a profit of 37,580 rupees.

1359
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:47,560
Thirty-seven thousand...

1360
01:34:48,200 --> 01:34:51,470
Why did my luck have to change today?
Bloody...

1361
01:34:51,800 --> 01:34:54,280
I don't want to sell.
Thanks a lot for your assistance.

1362
01:34:55,560 --> 01:34:58,720
You raised one question
and cleared the entire matter.

1363
01:34:58,800 --> 01:35:00,240
Couldn't you ask earlier?

1364
01:35:00,320 --> 01:35:02,120
I didn't have to bear such a loss!

1365
01:35:02,320 --> 01:35:04,520
What question, sir?

1366
01:35:04,600 --> 01:35:06,440
He had made me a promise.

1367
01:35:06,520 --> 01:35:08,400
How could he break his promise?

1368
01:35:08,480 --> 01:35:11,200
He came to help me
even after the break up.

1369
01:35:11,280 --> 01:35:14,000
Wow! Look at the character of that guy.

1370
01:35:14,120 --> 01:35:16,160
How can I leave such a guy?

1371
01:35:16,240 --> 01:35:19,360
Anyone can get a character certificate
by paying extra money.

1372
01:35:19,440 --> 01:35:20,760
But the boy is jobless.

1373
01:35:20,840 --> 01:35:23,000
Exactly my point.

1374
01:35:23,080 --> 01:35:27,320
But he taught me that
life doesn't end but starts at sixty.

1375
01:35:27,480 --> 01:35:30,080
That duffer made me... what is that?

1376
01:35:30,160 --> 01:35:31,400
He made me cool!

1377
01:35:31,480 --> 01:35:34,440
He's an MBA,
sooner or later he'll get a job.

1378
01:35:34,520 --> 01:35:35,680
That's okay, sir... but...

1379
01:35:35,760 --> 01:35:38,280
They don't think the way you do.

1380
01:35:38,360 --> 01:35:39,800
They are fighting.

1381
01:35:41,480 --> 01:35:43,920
Can there be a Romeo and Juliet
without a villain?

1382
01:35:46,360 --> 01:35:48,920
This time the villain will unite them.

1383
01:35:57,290 --> 01:35:58,340
Mayera!

1384
01:35:58,400 --> 01:36:00,680
Where were you?
I've been trying to call you.

1385
01:36:01,120 --> 01:36:03,000
Give me the keys, I need your passport.

1386
01:36:03,080 --> 01:36:04,800
Passport? Why?

1387
01:36:06,200 --> 01:36:08,920
- What?
- Sit here and hear me out.

1388
01:36:10,200 --> 01:36:11,200
What is this?

1389
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:14,080
Our new house, in Dubai.

1390
01:36:14,160 --> 01:36:15,320
Our new house?

1391
01:36:18,200 --> 01:36:21,400
A kitchen that's bigger than
our living room, fully equipped.

1392
01:36:24,080 --> 01:36:25,920
New vice president of the Dubai office.

1393
01:36:26,040 --> 01:36:27,880
Double the salary, that too in Dirhams.

1394
01:36:28,600 --> 01:36:30,040
See, I did what you wanted!

1395
01:36:32,320 --> 01:36:33,370
What?!

1396
01:36:34,640 --> 01:36:37,400
Don't say you don't want to go
because you don't have a choice.

1397
01:36:38,080 --> 01:36:41,400
No, silly! I'm shocked with happiness.

1398
01:36:41,880 --> 01:36:44,280
It's the best decision of your life.

1399
01:36:44,360 --> 01:36:45,640
Here are the keys.

1400
01:36:46,320 --> 01:36:48,240
We have to pack
everything in two days.

1401
01:36:48,440 --> 01:36:51,640
- Monday is the joining, or else no offer.
- Don't worry, I'm there.

1402
01:36:51,720 --> 01:36:53,840
I'll do what's right for you.

1403
01:36:53,920 --> 01:36:56,360
That good-for-nothing Mohit...

1404
01:36:56,440 --> 01:37:00,640
Just think, would you be able
to move to Dubai if you married him?

1405
01:37:01,240 --> 01:37:03,080
Radha, did you get the cartons?

1406
01:37:03,160 --> 01:37:04,280
Yes, I am getting them.

1407
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:07,640
We'll have our revenge before we go.

1408
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:11,160
I've told Gursharan to
make a fake case against him.

1409
01:37:11,240 --> 01:37:14,320
He'll be sent to Tihar jail for a week.

1410
01:37:16,680 --> 01:37:19,800
They will break his bones first.

1411
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:23,360
Then only the break-up will be completed.

1412
01:37:23,440 --> 01:37:25,830
- Wouldn't it be fun?
- You're just too much.

1413
01:37:26,440 --> 01:37:29,600
Call Mr. Gursharan right now and stop him.

1414
01:37:29,680 --> 01:37:32,320
Will you feel bad if he gets hurt?

1415
01:37:33,240 --> 01:37:37,160
Why are you running away to Dubai
if you love him this much?

1416
01:37:37,240 --> 01:37:39,080
I'll be out of your way.

1417
01:37:39,720 --> 01:37:43,520
See? You're getting confused about Dubai.

1418
01:37:43,880 --> 01:37:45,760
To be or not to be...

1419
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:47,880
Romeo and Juliet...

1420
01:37:49,240 --> 01:37:50,400
There's no confusion.

1421
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:54,320
I just don't want
any problems, that's all.

1422
01:37:55,560 --> 01:37:57,040
Talk to Mr. Gursharan.

1423
01:37:59,560 --> 01:38:02,640
Yes, Gursharan. Tihar-plan canceled.

1424
01:38:04,280 --> 01:38:05,290
Happy?

1425
01:38:07,640 --> 01:38:11,920
Hey, Gursharan, my friend.
Nobody has to be sent to Tihar.

1426
01:38:13,440 --> 01:38:16,320
Mayera has taken both
our passports to Ajanta Travels

1427
01:38:16,400 --> 01:38:17,880
for the tickets and visa.

1428
01:38:18,160 --> 01:38:23,360
Do something with the agency
so that we don't get the visas.

1429
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:26,760
Do you understand?
Yes, we shouldn't get the visas!

1430
01:38:30,920 --> 01:38:33,440
Come on, Mohit, answer the phone.

1431
01:38:34,240 --> 01:38:35,680
Oh, hell!

1432
01:38:37,320 --> 01:38:39,640
Now how do I contact this duffer?

1433
01:38:47,880 --> 01:38:49,520
- Sir?
- Yes. Mohit...

1434
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:52,160
Mohit was just here.
Maybe in the conference room?

1435
01:38:52,240 --> 01:38:55,480
Will you keep lying all your life
to save your friend?

1436
01:38:56,400 --> 01:38:57,640
I'm not lying.

1437
01:38:57,800 --> 01:39:00,000
Where is he? Tell me the truth.

1438
01:39:00,440 --> 01:39:02,840
He's changed his number,
doesn't reply to emails.

1439
01:39:02,920 --> 01:39:04,520
He's just vanished into thin air.

1440
01:39:06,840 --> 01:39:07,860
Think hard.

1441
01:39:08,440 --> 01:39:11,280
There must be someone
who can tell us about him.

1442
01:39:14,320 --> 01:39:15,560
Think hard.

1443
01:39:16,680 --> 01:39:18,600
The Home Secretary was my batchmate!

1444
01:39:21,320 --> 01:39:23,760
By God, what an unfortunate case.

1445
01:39:23,840 --> 01:39:26,120
I told him not to boast
about an automatic car.

1446
01:39:26,121 --> 01:39:28,400
What if you don't have a bicycle tomorrow?

1447
01:39:28,480 --> 01:39:29,680
He didn't listen to me.

1448
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:30,920
But where is he?

1449
01:39:33,120 --> 01:39:35,640
Stop, man, stop. Over there, sir.

1450
01:39:35,800 --> 01:39:37,720
Very good. Thank you, Master.

1451
01:39:37,880 --> 01:39:40,000
- Okay, Immy, thank you.
- Welcome, sir.

1452
01:40:08,360 --> 01:40:10,840
Do you get a salary,
or are you on daily wages?

1453
01:40:15,880 --> 01:40:18,680
Get me a cappuccino

1454
01:40:18,880 --> 01:40:21,520
and a cup of tea for you. It's on me.

1455
01:40:21,920 --> 01:40:23,800
No, thanks. One cappuccino, please!

1456
01:40:24,600 --> 01:40:25,660
Anything else?

1457
01:40:28,720 --> 01:40:30,170
Let me help increase your sales.

1458
01:40:30,200 --> 01:40:32,160
You must be getting a commission?

1459
01:40:35,400 --> 01:40:39,720
Don't you ever stop loving me

1460
01:40:39,880 --> 01:40:44,160
I can live without everything but love

1461
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:49,120
Don't you ever stop loving me

1462
01:40:49,560 --> 01:40:50,670
Hey, boy!

1463
01:40:51,240 --> 01:40:53,800
What kind of service is this?
Clean the damn table!

1464
01:41:02,160 --> 01:41:03,200
Take it.

1465
01:41:03,680 --> 01:41:06,680
You can get your new girlfriend peanuts
with it.

1466
01:41:07,120 --> 01:41:09,320
This time look for someone of your status.

1467
01:41:10,440 --> 01:41:11,600
Why have you come here?

1468
01:41:11,680 --> 01:41:15,120
To tell you that Mayera
is moving to Dubai.

1469
01:41:18,800 --> 01:41:20,120
It hurts, doesn't it?

1470
01:41:21,440 --> 01:41:23,320
How you both used to boast...

1471
01:41:23,640 --> 01:41:26,320
Love is everything and all that bullshit!

1472
01:41:26,480 --> 01:41:29,680
"We can fill love in the gas tank
and drive off!"

1473
01:41:30,480 --> 01:41:31,640
So, where is all that love?

1474
01:41:32,080 --> 01:41:34,440
Now do you understand the value of money?

1475
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:38,320
As always, Mayera is smarter than you.

1476
01:41:39,280 --> 01:41:40,920
She's taken a transfer to Dubai.

1477
01:41:41,720 --> 01:41:44,560
In a week, Dubai will make her forget
you and the pain.

1478
01:41:45,320 --> 01:41:47,600
You just keep selling your tea
and coffee here.

1479
01:41:49,040 --> 01:41:53,640
You think you're very smart?
But you're just a big duffer!

1480
01:41:53,880 --> 01:41:55,680
Don't you understand?

1481
01:41:56,040 --> 01:41:58,240
Mayera is spoiled rotten.

1482
01:41:58,400 --> 01:42:00,760
She's gotten used to the five-star life.

1483
01:42:01,280 --> 01:42:04,920
You would have gone bankrupt
if you'd married.

1484
01:42:05,120 --> 01:42:07,800
See, as soon as you lost your money,

1485
01:42:07,880 --> 01:42:10,800
that snob tossed you aside
like an insignificant fly!

1486
01:42:10,880 --> 01:42:12,440
It's your own daughter!

1487
01:42:12,520 --> 01:42:14,640
Why are you feeling bad?

1488
01:42:15,360 --> 01:42:17,160
What does she mean to you now?

1489
01:42:18,520 --> 01:42:21,400
Anyway, she dumped you
and now she's leaving.

1490
01:42:21,480 --> 01:42:22,840
That too, in business class!

1491
01:42:23,600 --> 01:42:26,040
Remember not to
fall in love with a money-minded,

1492
01:42:26,120 --> 01:42:28,200
selfish, opportunist like Mayera...

1493
01:42:30,880 --> 01:42:32,160
You've said enough.

1494
01:42:32,240 --> 01:42:34,216
Now if you say even one word
against Mayera I'll...

1495
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:36,600
You'll what? What will you do?

1496
01:42:37,320 --> 01:42:40,320
Empty pockets with Romeoesque zeal
doesn't suit each other.

1497
01:42:41,240 --> 01:42:43,440
You flaunt your love
like you're some millionaire.

1498
01:42:44,040 --> 01:42:46,840
But you're just a bloody waiter!

1499
01:42:47,640 --> 01:42:51,560
We're leaving for the airport
in about three hours, understood?

1500
01:42:51,640 --> 01:42:55,280
If I see you within a five kilometer
radius of the airport...

1501
01:42:55,480 --> 01:42:58,680
Remember, the Home Secretary
is my batchmate!

1502
01:43:01,160 --> 01:43:03,680
Your photo will go to the home department.

1503
01:43:04,120 --> 01:43:06,600
Then it will flash to
every PCR van, Black Cats,

1504
01:43:06,680 --> 01:43:10,440
NSG commandos, CRPF, RAW agents etc.

1505
01:43:31,120 --> 01:43:32,200
She's moving to Dubai.

1506
01:43:33,120 --> 01:43:34,560
She could have at least told me!

1507
01:43:35,280 --> 01:43:37,320
No point in being sad right now.

1508
01:43:37,480 --> 01:43:40,680
- Go say sorry to ma'am and stop her.
- How can I?

1509
01:43:41,360 --> 01:43:43,840
She's the one who broke up,
she has to say sorry.

1510
01:43:43,920 --> 01:43:45,680
It's not a race, sir.

1511
01:43:45,760 --> 01:43:48,120
What would you do with your king-size ego?

1512
01:43:48,200 --> 01:43:50,800
Ma'am will be gone
and you'll be left alone to wonder.

1513
01:43:51,280 --> 01:43:54,280
"Bloody waiter."
Sir, that old man's insulted us all.

1514
01:43:54,520 --> 01:43:56,520
You have to give it back to
that rotten fellow!

1515
01:43:56,680 --> 01:44:00,080
Yes, sir, steal Mayera away
from right under his nose.

1516
01:44:00,160 --> 01:44:01,440
That'll be a fitting reply.

1517
01:44:03,160 --> 01:44:06,100
Are you done?
Enough of me and my life.

1518
01:44:06,880 --> 01:44:09,480
- Get back to work.
- Sir, please listen to me...

1519
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:16,600
Hey! Stop right here.

1520
01:44:16,920 --> 01:44:18,120
Stop here, please.

1521
01:44:19,080 --> 01:44:20,920
- How much?
- Forty-five, mister...

1522
01:44:21,320 --> 01:44:22,480
Keep the change.

1523
01:44:22,840 --> 01:44:25,160
Where were you, Dad?
Get ready or we'll be late.

1524
01:44:25,240 --> 01:44:26,840
I'll just get ready.

1525
01:44:37,600 --> 01:44:40,040
Radha, you've latched
all the windows properly?

1526
01:44:40,120 --> 01:44:41,920
- Yes!
- Switched off the gas?

1527
01:44:42,040 --> 01:44:43,640
- I have.
- All right!

1528
01:44:43,800 --> 01:44:46,640
Give all the papers to Mr. Gursharan.

1529
01:44:47,040 --> 01:44:48,560
Clean up every Saturday,

1530
01:44:48,640 --> 01:44:50,640
else I won't come back to get you.

1531
01:44:50,720 --> 01:44:52,360
Miss, please don't go.

1532
01:44:52,680 --> 01:44:54,200
Why are you crying?

1533
01:44:54,800 --> 01:44:56,520
I'm coming back to get you, okay?

1534
01:44:57,160 --> 01:44:59,440
- Please don't go, Miss.
- Silly girl!

1535
01:44:59,520 --> 01:45:01,320
I will miss you a lot...

1536
01:45:04,680 --> 01:45:08,520
Now stop crying
and take all the bags out, okay?

1537
01:45:15,040 --> 01:45:16,800
What do we do about the rings?

1538
01:45:18,720 --> 01:45:20,840
I've never abused so much in my life.

1539
01:45:22,400 --> 01:45:24,640
I called my own daughter a snob!

1540
01:45:26,120 --> 01:45:28,400
These two are more stubborn than me.

1541
01:45:31,160 --> 01:45:33,400
God knows how the gold prices are now.

1542
01:45:33,480 --> 01:45:35,760
Sell them anyway
irrespective of profit or loss

1543
01:45:35,840 --> 01:45:37,600
and deposit the money in my account.

1544
01:45:39,080 --> 01:45:42,120
I guess, this time too
Romeo and Juliet will have a tragic end.

1545
01:45:45,280 --> 01:45:47,680
- Come here, sir.
- What's the matter?

1546
01:45:52,560 --> 01:45:54,560
Now let's make sure he doesn't go free!

1547
01:45:54,920 --> 01:45:58,280
Gursharan, pick up a weapon!

1548
01:45:58,360 --> 01:45:59,920
- Wait, sir, I'm coming too.
- No.

1549
01:46:00,040 --> 01:46:01,600
That old man is dangerous.

1550
01:46:01,880 --> 01:46:04,600
I know, but after all
he is my father-in-law.

1551
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:14,440
Mr. Mohit!

1552
01:46:15,640 --> 01:46:17,080
Beware!

1553
01:46:17,480 --> 01:46:21,160
Don't you dare take a single step,
or I'll make you a cripple.

1554
01:46:21,840 --> 01:46:24,120
Gursharan, call the Police Commissioner.

1555
01:46:25,400 --> 01:46:28,440
- The Home Secretary...
- Yes, I know, he's your batchmate.

1556
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:30,400
I don't want to talk to you.

1557
01:46:31,200 --> 01:46:33,440
Call Mayera. Call her.

1558
01:46:40,360 --> 01:46:41,920
Why should Mayera come?

1559
01:46:42,760 --> 01:46:46,200
Who are you, just a waiter?

1560
01:46:48,360 --> 01:46:52,160
First, earn some money,
have a hefty bank balance.

1561
01:46:52,480 --> 01:46:55,720
My Mayera won't go with a loser.

1562
01:46:56,440 --> 01:46:59,320
She's come to her senses now,
you bloody penny-pincher!

1563
01:46:59,480 --> 01:47:00,720
Sir, reality check.

1564
01:47:01,160 --> 01:47:03,120
You're behaving utterly
uncool right now, sir.

1565
01:47:04,080 --> 01:47:07,320
Insulting my waiter friends is uncool.

1566
01:47:07,760 --> 01:47:11,160
Calling Mayera snob and selfish is uncool.

1567
01:47:11,640 --> 01:47:15,400
And your hundred-year-old money theory,
that's uncool too.

1568
01:47:15,640 --> 01:47:17,400
If one followed your theory,

1569
01:47:17,800 --> 01:47:19,920
the poor would not have life or love.

1570
01:47:21,680 --> 01:47:22,840
If there is love...

1571
01:47:24,160 --> 01:47:27,480
thirty rupees and one cup of coffee...

1572
01:47:30,320 --> 01:47:31,640
is enough to be happy.

1573
01:47:32,840 --> 01:47:34,080
What if there's no money...

1574
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:36,200
there's unlimited love.

1575
01:47:38,560 --> 01:47:41,320
Money or no money, love finds its way.

1576
01:47:41,400 --> 01:47:44,040
If there's love, right? If?

1577
01:47:44,240 --> 01:47:45,800
She hates you.

1578
01:47:46,080 --> 01:47:48,600
And you must know, we were going to pray

1579
01:47:48,680 --> 01:47:51,560
at the Hanuman temple
on the way to the airport

1580
01:47:51,640 --> 01:47:53,400
for your unhappy ever after,

1581
01:47:53,480 --> 01:47:55,680
- You bloody loser.
- Dad, enough!

1582
01:47:56,840 --> 01:47:58,400
What's Mohit done to you?

1583
01:47:58,920 --> 01:48:00,240
He agreed to the probation.

1584
01:48:00,320 --> 01:48:01,760
He lost matches against you.

1585
01:48:01,840 --> 01:48:04,880
He's the national level under-16
silver medalist in squash.

1586
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:06,520
Yet he lost all the matches for you.

1587
01:48:06,600 --> 01:48:08,400
He helped you with your job-hunting,

1588
01:48:08,480 --> 01:48:10,800
lied to me for you.

1589
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:14,280
He calls you Osama
and you really are like a terrorist.

1590
01:48:14,440 --> 01:48:17,400
He kept tolerating you for me.

1591
01:48:21,720 --> 01:48:23,080
If he can do so much for me,

1592
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:25,560
he can also give his life for me.

1593
01:48:30,720 --> 01:48:34,440
A waiter or a manager,
a prince or a pauper...

1594
01:48:35,680 --> 01:48:36,840
I love him.

1595
01:48:38,640 --> 01:48:40,400
Some sacrifices will be there.

1596
01:48:40,760 --> 01:48:42,480
I won't get to go to rock shows,

1597
01:48:42,560 --> 01:48:45,040
dinner once a month, shopping once a year?

1598
01:48:45,120 --> 01:48:47,560
I ain't gonna work
at a coffee shop all my life...

1599
01:48:47,640 --> 01:48:49,200
Until you do,

1600
01:48:49,840 --> 01:48:51,000
we will still have fun.

1601
01:48:52,840 --> 01:48:55,320
I don't enjoy shopping at all without you.

1602
01:48:55,840 --> 01:48:58,800
Irrespective of the amount
of money or the credit card limits.

1603
01:48:59,760 --> 01:49:01,640
If you're not around then who'll say...

1604
01:49:01,840 --> 01:49:04,240
Very hot! Shall I gobble you up?

1605
01:49:17,840 --> 01:49:21,120
No hanky–panky before marriage!

1606
01:49:23,320 --> 01:49:25,120
Weren't you very happy with our break-up?

1607
01:49:25,520 --> 01:49:29,240
Your generation always has to do
the opposite of what the parents say?

1608
01:49:33,320 --> 01:49:35,400
If I had listed his good qualities,

1609
01:49:35,760 --> 01:49:38,400
would you say sorry
and patch up with him? No!

1610
01:49:38,720 --> 01:49:40,800
I abused him,
only then did you understand.

1611
01:49:42,040 --> 01:49:43,280
Hey, stupid!

1612
01:49:43,360 --> 01:49:46,160
You called me "uncool", you bloody fool!

1613
01:49:46,600 --> 01:49:48,360
Seek my blessings, son-in-law!

1614
01:49:50,760 --> 01:49:52,880
Not like this, give me a hug.

1615
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:54,200
A good one...

1616
01:49:54,280 --> 01:49:55,520
Stupid fellow...

1617
01:49:56,920 --> 01:49:57,980
Come here!

1618
01:49:58,760 --> 01:50:00,000
Now give us the rings.

1619
01:50:00,360 --> 01:50:04,480
Your wish means everything,
and mine means nothing?

1620
01:50:04,880 --> 01:50:06,160
Which wish?

1621
01:50:06,240 --> 01:50:08,160
I have an interview today.

1622
01:50:08,240 --> 01:50:09,400
I have to go there.

1623
01:50:12,400 --> 01:50:14,520
Let him go, else
he'll never leave us alone.

1624
01:50:14,600 --> 01:50:18,760
- The pressure of a private job at his age?
- He's letting you decide for yourself.

1625
01:50:30,280 --> 01:50:32,000
So? How am I looking?

1626
01:50:33,160 --> 01:50:35,920
- Don't you have a suit?
- Suit?

1627
01:50:36,400 --> 01:50:39,280
I got a new safari suit made for this,
from Singh Tailors...

1628
01:50:43,560 --> 01:50:45,240
- Where are you taking me?
- Come on.

1629
01:50:47,280 --> 01:50:50,040
You guys have sandwiched me in between!

1630
01:50:50,120 --> 01:50:51,800
The sandwich needs a good tie!

1631
01:50:53,360 --> 01:50:54,720
I can't leave you and go to Dubai.

1632
01:50:54,800 --> 01:51:01,100
Thankfully the heart is smart

1633
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:06,320
After having been someone else's

1634
01:51:06,400 --> 01:51:09,600
You'll shift out of this
hole after marriage, won't you?

1635
01:51:09,800 --> 01:51:11,040
Say sorry, sir.

1636
01:51:12,440 --> 01:51:14,040
Say sorry, sir, or no tie.

1637
01:51:14,120 --> 01:51:16,360
Sorry, sorry!

1638
01:51:18,640 --> 01:51:21,480
Please get me a sober tie
that suits my age.

1639
01:51:23,760 --> 01:51:26,160
- Where are you going?
- He'll get something silly.

1640
01:51:26,360 --> 01:51:28,320
Okay, choose a good one.

1641
01:51:28,400 --> 01:51:31,320
We've saved this day at last

1642
01:51:31,520 --> 01:51:34,320
We've solved the issues

1643
01:51:35,160 --> 01:51:37,600
You and I, together

1644
01:51:37,800 --> 01:51:41,560
Oh, so romantic Utterly romantic

1645
01:51:41,640 --> 01:51:44,680
You and I, I and you

1646
01:51:44,760 --> 01:51:48,120
- I missed you.
- What took you so long?

1647
01:52:18,080 --> 01:52:21,880
Sir, don't show off
about the Home Secretary

1648
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:23,520
in the interview.

1649
01:52:23,600 --> 01:52:26,920
It'll make a good impression.
You won't understand.

1650
01:52:27,040 --> 01:52:28,760
Dad, it doesn't.

1651
01:52:30,400 --> 01:52:32,760
I thought that's why
Mohit is scared of me.

1652
01:52:32,920 --> 01:52:34,200
You're not scared of me?

1653
01:52:38,040 --> 01:52:39,400
Don't scare anyone.

1654
01:52:39,480 --> 01:52:41,320
It's an interview.

1655
01:52:43,920 --> 01:52:45,920
- Sehgal VK.
- They're asking for your name

1656
01:52:46,040 --> 01:52:47,880
- not your email ID!
- Vinod Kumar Sehgal.

1657
01:52:54,520 --> 01:52:57,360
Sir, your girlfriend is top-class.

1658
01:52:59,200 --> 01:53:00,240
Peter.

1659
01:53:00,320 --> 01:53:02,360
Top-class coffee
for the top-class girlfriend.

1660
01:53:02,400 --> 01:53:05,120
Sir, take one cup and share.

1661
01:53:08,640 --> 01:53:10,720
Your financing skills, and my marketing,

1662
01:53:10,920 --> 01:53:12,120
let's open a coffee shop.

1663
01:53:12,400 --> 01:53:14,720
I've understood one thing from all this.

1664
01:53:15,120 --> 01:53:17,920
People don't stop drinking coffee
even if there's no money.

1665
01:53:18,280 --> 01:53:21,240
Brilliant! We'll call it One Cup Coffee.

1666
01:53:21,360 --> 01:53:22,640
- Nah!
- Why not?

1667
01:53:22,720 --> 01:53:24,240
People will drink only one cup, then!

1668
01:53:24,440 --> 01:53:26,320
Listen, I'll select the name.

1669
01:53:26,400 --> 01:53:28,800
The Home Secretary is my Dad's batchmate!

1670
01:53:29,040 --> 01:53:31,760
I'm going to gobble
this Home Secretary up!

1671
01:53:32,240 --> 01:53:33,420
Osama.

1672
01:54:16,640 --> 01:54:21,840
Our story will be there
On the no-good's books

1673
01:54:24,040 --> 01:54:29,280
Chapter by chapter
We'll recite our fairytale

1674
01:54:31,640 --> 01:54:35,240
Unfinished and broken
Authentic yet miserable

1675
01:54:35,320 --> 01:54:38,560
Is the story of our life

1676
01:54:38,680 --> 01:54:42,280
What do we care about the world

1677
01:54:42,640 --> 01:54:46,160
We'll recite it to us anyway

1678
01:54:47,040 --> 01:54:50,840
Oh, so romantic Utterly romantic

1679
01:54:51,200 --> 01:54:54,600
You and I, I and you

1680
01:54:54,680 --> 01:54:57,920
Oh, so romantic Utterly romantic

1681
01:54:58,280 --> 01:55:01,720
This journey of love

1682
01:55:49,240 --> 01:55:55,160
The vast land of promises

1683
01:55:56,400 --> 01:55:59,760
Either at high price

1684
01:55:59,840 --> 01:56:03,620
Or at low

1685
01:56:03,760 --> 01:56:06,520
Wherever you get this land

1686
01:56:06,600 --> 01:56:09,930
No matter how or when

1687
01:56:11,280 --> 01:56:14,320
That's the road to love

1688
01:56:14,520 --> 01:56:17,680
Long and precious

1689
01:56:18,440 --> 01:56:21,760
During long lazy afternoons there

1690
01:56:22,360 --> 01:56:25,880
In between mischief and laughter

1691
01:56:26,200 --> 01:56:31,760
We'll steal away the warmth from the sun
