1
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:02,440
"Golmaal..."

2
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,510
"Hello...Hi...Namaste...salutations!"

3
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,350
"We're back to have a blast."

4
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:16,070
"We'll turn your boring
moments into something colorful."

5
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:19,560
"The celebrations wont stop."

6
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,720
"Our friendship is
the talk of the town..."

7
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:25,560
"...and even you can join the gang."

8
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:31,120
"Stop being shy from the
world...and scream and shout."

9
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,760
"Go...Go...Golmaal"

10
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,200
"Go...Go...Golmaal"

11
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,920
"Everything's gonna
be Go...Go...Golmaal."

12
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:38,360
"Go...Go...Golmaal"

13
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,920
"Go...Go...Golmaal"

14
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,600
"Everything's gonna
be Go...Go...Golmaal."

15
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:59,890
"Fool your sorrows and smile openly."

16
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:03,050
"Stop ringing the
bells of your worry..."

17
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,690
"...and let your heart beat loud."

18
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:08,770
"Whistle loudly ..."

19
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:11,610
"...and have a blast daily."

20
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:14,330
"Show your zest..."

21
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:17,130
"...and scream and shout loudly."

22
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:18,810
"Go...Go...Golmaal"

23
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:20,170
"Go...Go...Golmaal"

24
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,930
"Everything's gonna
be Go...Go...Golmaal."

25
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:24,540
"Go...Go...Golmaal"

26
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:26,020
"Go...Go...Golmaal"

27
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:29,010
"Everything's gonna
be Go...Go...Golmaal."

28
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,270
People are right.

29
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:44,280
I shouldn't be working here.

30
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,590
It's a weird place.

31
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,350
Anna madam.

32
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,880
I've kept all the books in its place.

33
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,510
Shall we leave?
- Hmm...

34
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,150
Keep the lock here, I will go later.

35
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,840
Madam, it's quite late...and dark too.

36
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,920
Don't worry, Peter.
I'll manage on my own.

37
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,440
Keep it.
- Okay, madam.

38
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:22,690
What is your problem?

39
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:24,520
You can see me?

40
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,930
Myself Ram Krishn Iyer.

41
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,290
Born 1956, Died 2016.

42
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:35,370
Can you see all kinds of spirits?

43
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:40,570
When I was a small,
I always prayed to God for a gift.

44
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:42,930
And this became my God's gift.

45
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:45,610
Maybe that's why...

46
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:49,300
... after I died,
I wandered to this place.

47
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:51,940
Can you please help me?
- Yes.

48
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:55,060
We belong to a strict Brahmin family.

49
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:58,370
But my daughter Prerna,
she loved a Muslim boy.

50
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:02,210
How can I accept that?
So I disowned her.

51
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,130
For years I did not talk to her.

52
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:07,660
But, for her every birthday
I wrote her a letter.

53
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,540
Because I realized
how much I missed her.

54
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:15,700
But, I could never muster the
courage to post those letters.

55
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:18,140
Before that, I died.

56
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:22,940
I want you to deliver
those letters to her.

57
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:27,060
Let my daughter know
that I accept her.

58
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,660
I love her.

59
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:49,430
'How is it possible?
How can I see them?'

60
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:51,420
'How can I talk to them?'

61
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:53,470
'Soo many questions.'

62
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:56,190
'Well, the bottom line is...'

63
00:06:56,270 --> 00:07:01,350
'...when it's God's will , there
is no logic in things, only magic.'

64
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:03,000
'But, then there are some spirits...'

65
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:05,110
'...whose wishes remain unfulfilled.'

66
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:09,480
'Maybe that's why God chose me...'

67
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:13,950
'...so that I can act as a medium,
a path to fulfill their wishes.'

68
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,910
'And their spirits
can attain salvation.'

69
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,710
'I've helped many such
souls since my childhood.'

70
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:20,390
'But, there was a spirit...'

71
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:22,720
'...whose story was
connected with my life.'

72
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,080
'It is a story worth listening to.'

73
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,320
'The story begins
from Jamnadas Orphanage.'

74
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:51,320
'Jamnadas was a successful
businessman of his time.'

75
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:53,600
'He was so committed
towards social work...'

76
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,090
'...that one day he wrapped
up his entire business...

77
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,560
...and built an institution
for the orphaned children.'

78
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,450
'Jamnadas Orphanage!'

79
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:03,130
'The first child at
the orphanage was Gopal...'

80
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:07,040
'...had sold his brain off
and bought anger in wholesale.'

81
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:09,330
'And this is Madhav.'

82
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:12,090
'He enjoyed sticking his
'finger' into others business...'

83
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:14,810
'...just as much Gopal
enjoyed breaking them.'

84
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:16,850
Aaahh Sh**

85
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:19,610
'During night,
Gopal was very scared of the dark.'

86
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:21,890
Oh.. Relax, it's Laxman.

87
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:24,970
'And that's why Gopal clung
on to Laxman's finger.'

88
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:26,210
Laxman.

89
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,690
Me?
- Not you, him.

90
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,850
'There was another Laxman here.'

91
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,290
'And this is Lucky.'

92
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:33,300
'This Poor child couldn't speak.'

93
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,050
'Amongst the orphan kids...'

94
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:36,940
'...Jamnadas' favorite was Pappi.'

95
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,090
What's wrong, Pappi?

96
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,940
Pappi? Shameless!

97
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,740
'And then, one day.'

98
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,460
The baby has fever.

99
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:06,100
There the girl smiled and that
Bought a smile to everyones face.'

100
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:10,230
'And Since then the kids named
her 'Khushi' (Happiness)'

101
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:13,540
Khushi.
- Yes...Khushi.

102
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:19,020
'Usually, human beings look
for love and care in their own...'

103
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:20,980
'...within their family
and relationships.'

104
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:22,110
'But if you look here.'

105
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:24,030
'These kids don't share
any bond or relationship.'

106
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:26,470
'Except for love.'

107
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:37,360
'That is me...Anna Mathew.

108
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,350
This is my dad's library.'

109
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,950
Where the children from the orphanage
would often come over.'

110
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:44,230
"Since Childhood
I could see spirits ...'

111
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,520
'...and these five knew all about it.'

112
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:48,960
There you go again, Anna.
Who is it this time?

113
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:50,600
Stella Aunty.

114
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,590
She passed away three days back.
- What?

115
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,030
See! She's right next to you.
- Laxman!

116
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,510
Relax, Gopu.

117
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,400
'Ghosts, spirits, souls... Gopal
was scared of them all.'

118
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,720
'And Madhav would always
take full advantage of it.'

119
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,200
Gopal, you hit the ball.
You'll only have to go get it.

120
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,800
'Adjacent to the orphanage...'

121
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,960
'...was Jamnadas' close friend Col.
Chouhan's bungalow...

122
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,160
...which was locked for many years.'

123
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:44,520
'Madhav, Lucky,
Laxman and Gopal never got along.'

124
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:46,370
Gopal, I've told you this many times.

125
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:48,810
You're always picking
a fight with someone.

126
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:51,610
Go...stand outside
the orphanage's gate.

127
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:53,570
Madhav started it...
- Go!

128
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:58,050
Gopu, I'll also come with you.

129
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:00,770
'Jamnadas scolded the kids a lot.'

130
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:03,850
Laxman, we won't stay here anymore.

131
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:07,050
'Gopal and Laxman decided
to leave the orphanage.'

132
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:11,260
Madhav, Lucky,
and Laxman also left the orphanage.

133
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,970
'Jamnadas would often miss the kids.'

134
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:19,330
'But the person who missed
those five the most was Khushi.'

135
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:26,020
'And finally, the day arrived
when someone adopted Khushi.'

136
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:29,700
'But one thing always
bothered Khushi...'

137
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:32,980
...where would they be,
and what were they doing.'

138
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:47,710
Aye..Babli. ..we've seized this plot.

139
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:52,220
And you can't ...
- Quiet you stupid numbskull cartoon!

140
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:56,390
I'll get this plot vacated,
My poor man's prince Charming

141
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:58,550
I see...you'll vacate this place?

142
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:04,310
No, you moron.
This 'plot' P I L O T... PLOT

143
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:07,510
...will be vacated by my buddy Gopal.

144
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:14,870
I see...so he's Gopal.

145
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:16,870
What can this skinny boy do?

146
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:19,400
Just like nine comes before ten...

147
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,910
...similarly,
before the leader comes the follower.

148
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:25,680
Understand.
- Sons of pig...he's coming.

149
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:28,320
100 percent he's going
to hang you by the noose.

150
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:31,280
200 percent he'll
send you to your graves.

151
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,400
300 percent he'll
erase your existence.

152
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,440
What? Finding it hard to breathe?

153
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:41,240
Maybe, but why are
you gasping for air!

154
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,520
Insult! Insult!

155
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,120
Gopu...smash them,
bash them...finish them!

156
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,080
Gopu!

157
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,690
Gopu!

158
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:56,800
He doesn't sleep at night
because he's afraid of the dark...

159
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:58,720
...and dozes off during the day.

160
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,360
Gopu...get up, Gopu.

161
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:02,560
This sleeping beauty
bit is bad for business.

162
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:04,000
He's the one insulting me.

163
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:05,970
Gopu, if this continues...

164
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:08,520
...then no one will respect
us in the society.

165
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:12,570
I have an idea.

166
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:52,300
So... Swami sent you to
evict the plot from us, huh!

167
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:56,780
Get lost.

168
00:13:57,050 --> 00:14:00,260
"Finger...Finger...Finger..."

169
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,490
Hospital.

170
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,970
OH! Come.

171
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,610
You really cleaned
Them up well, my boy.

172
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:49,490
Gopal...here's your payment
for clearing the plot.

173
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:50,810
Enjoy.

174
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:52,610
Send this to Jamanadas Orphanage.

175
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:57,770
Uncle Sam was right...
Charity begins at Home-work. buddy

176
00:15:57,850 --> 00:15:59,890
Gopal, you have a big
heart and a lot of courage ...

177
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:03,890
I'll go to Ooty right away
and give this money to the orphanage.

178
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:06,210
And anyway, soon it will be dark.

179
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,290
Dark?

180
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:11,650
When darkness spreads over Kunnur...

181
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:13,460
...even the postman doesn't
step out of to deliver posts.

182
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,770
Understood.

183
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:17,540
Where's my He-man!?

184
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,180
I am running out of patience, Sweety.

185
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:30,820
Come urgent.

186
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,460
No, not to Argentina,
come urgently. fast

187
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,140
For my sake.

188
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:37,860
I went through a lot of trouble...

189
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:40,740
...to secretly build this costly
house which my family unaware of.

190
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:43,230
Come, Sweety...we'll have a ball.

191
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:46,150
Not football... Celebration!

192
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:51,390
you coming?
I'll take a cold shower, and get hot.

193
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:01,620
Lucky, He's in the bathroom,
you go upstairs.

194
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:02,620
Laxma-

195
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:25,520
Blood! Blood!

196
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:27,510
Blood!

197
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:51,000
Ghost! Ghost!

198
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,240
There's only one way, Mr. Naidu.

199
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:03,080
Sell your house for 20 million.

200
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:05,640
That house is worth 40 million,
Vasooli bhai.

201
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,770
It's a total loss.

202
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:11,610
Everyone in Ooty knows
that your house is haunted.

203
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:15,210
It's only my humbleness that
I am offering you 20 million.

204
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:19,250
And anyway, your real
motive is all about having fun.

205
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,210
There's another bungalow close-by...

206
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:24,240
...and it's price is
increasing by the minute.

207
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:26,690
30 million.
- How much?

208
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:29,370
31 million.
- One million in a minute?

209
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:31,450
Like I said...the price
goes up every minute.

210
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:32,890
Then seal the deal.
- Okay.

211
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:34,490
Done.

212
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:36,330
Sweety, address change.

213
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:38,460
Boys!

214
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:40,620
Long Live Vasooli Bhai!

215
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,730
Long Live Vasooli Bhai!
- Enough!

216
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:45,370
Here's your money.
- Thank you.

217
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,010
Tell me something, Madhav...

218
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:53,140
...what makes people believe
that ghosts really exist?

219
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:54,970
Simple logic, Vasooli bhai.

220
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:56,340
Where there are humans,
there's fear.

221
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:57,900
Where there's fear,
there's blind-faith.

222
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:00,700
And, where there's blind-faith,
there are ghosts. - And.

223
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,100
Where there are ghosts,
there are spirits.

224
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:03,020
Where there's lentil, there's sauce.

225
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,700
If you stretch too far,
your pant is going to tear.

226
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:05,980
Shut up!

227
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,060
Here you go.

228
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:10,580
Donation...Jamnadas Orphanage.

229
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:13,580
Vasooli bhai, people never
forget their first love...

230
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,540
...how can we forget our first home?
- Yes.

231
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:16,780
That reminds me...

232
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:19,340
...what about Swami's
plot which someone had seized?

233
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:23,420
Oh man...your childhood friends,
Gopal and Laxman.

234
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:27,380
They cleared that
plot long back with Babli.

235
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:28,910
Childhood friends?

236
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:31,310
We'd rather have enemies,
than friends like them.

237
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:32,510
Madhav.
- Yeah...

238
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:35,350
Gopal always foils our plans.
- Yes...

239
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:36,790
What do we do about him?

240
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:40,230
When a guy like him
gets out of hand...

241
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:42,790
...then we must press his weak point.

242
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:43,790
Weak point?

243
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:44,950
Yeah...

244
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:46,510
Fear...

245
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:48,470
Darkness...

246
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:50,190
Ghost!

247
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:57,550
Save me from ghosts and spirits.

248
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,390
Protect me from evil powers.

249
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:02,550
Don't let bad spirits or
witches come anywhere near me.

250
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:14,830
Mummy...

251
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:17,470
Gopu, it's me Laxman. Relax.

252
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:18,550
You're soo unbelievable.

253
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:19,750
You beat up a dozen by day...

254
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:21,350
...but, sleep like a coward at night.

255
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:22,790
Just relax.

256
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:24,590
Come, let's sleep.

257
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:32,630
Laxman, ghost.

258
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:34,350
What! what happened? Gopu.

259
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:39,000
Gopu It's Sudari .... Sundari.

260
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:41,190
Our neighborhood dog Sundari. Gopu

261
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:43,800
I've told you this soo many times,
there's no such thing as a ghost.

262
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:44,830
Gopu, please.

263
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,990
Just like on Christmas,
everyone says...

264
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:48,510
...Santa's coming, Santa's coming.

265
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,040
But everyone knows,
he's not coming, period.

266
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:52,680
Similarly, there's no
such thing as a ghost, Gopu.

267
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:55,390
Come here... come here..
come On my lap. Come on my lap.

268
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,150
I know you're a naughty boy.

269
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,030
You won't sleep until I
sing you a lullaby.

270
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:03,720
"The apple of Jamnadas' eye..."

271
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:06,790
"...and Laxman's Gopala."

272
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:10,030
"There are no ghost's
relatives here..."

273
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:13,030
"...nor any spirits friends."

274
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:22,590
Gopu! Gopu!

275
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,950
All the lights went off!

276
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:25,430
Gopu Don't be scared,
Don't be scared!

277
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:26,520
I'll go have a look.
- Yeah.

278
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:27,990
Don't go anywhere.
- Yes.

279
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:29,640
Don't go anywhere, Gopu.

280
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:36,710
I see...so you guys were
Pulling the prank.

281
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:39,960
Yes! My DJ wale Babu's disc.

282
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:43,150
Insult!

283
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:46,510
Gopu! Gopu, come here.
Come out. Come here.

284
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:48,840
Come here, Gopu.
Smash them, Gopu. Smash them.

285
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:51,430

286
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,200
Come Gopu, come.

287
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:55,430
Gopu, don't be afraid of the dark.

288
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:57,520
I am right here, Gopu.
Go, smash them.

289
00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:01,120
Gopu, if you stick your
finger in our business again...

290
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:02,910
...you will only see
darkness in your life.

291
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,790
Stop threatening Gopu.

292
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:09,480
First Turn on the lights.
- You two come out first.

293
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:12,600
Turn on the lights first.
- You two come out first.

294
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,630
Turn it on.
- Show us.

295
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:16,680
Turn it on.
- Show us.

296
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:19,120
Turn it on.
- Show us.

297
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:20,320
Turn it on...

298
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,870
Gopu...Gopu...
- Qui..et!

299
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,120
Qui..et!

300
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:31,510
Stop it!

301
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:35,030
Stop prancing around
like little kids.

302
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:41,270
And you, you sly man what are you doing
here with my strongest of the strong men?

303
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:45,350
There's bad news for all of you.
- What? what happened?

304
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:48,670
Gopal, I went over to the
orphanage to donate your money.

305
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:54,230
found out there, that
Jamnadas is D U D E... is Dead.

306
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,960
His memorial service is tomorrow.

307
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:02,190
I think you all should
go to the orphanage.

308
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:06,360
We'll go.
- We'll also come with you.

309
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,350
Alright.
- Gopu, these guys.

310
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:11,830
Go and sleep, children.

311
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:15,910
Tomorrow is Friday the 13th
Mr. Jamnadas' memorial service.

312
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:28,830
all five left together
but none of them knew how..

313
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:43,080
..their life was going to
change from that point onwards.

314
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,750
Excuse me. Is this where Mr.
Jamnadas' memorial service happen?

315
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,470
There's still some time
for the rituals to begin.

316
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,720
I see...

317
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,790
Let's take a look
around the orphanage.

318
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,600
Yeah... it's been 25 years.

319
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,560
I wonder what all
has changed around here.

320
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,920
Nothing has changed.

321
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,560
Everything is still
the same till today.

322
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,240
Yes, Gopu.

323
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:31,800
But someone made paintings everywhere.

324
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,480
Superb, right?

325
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:53,830
Gopu... The Haunted Home.
Remember?

326
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,040
There's no way he can
forget this haunted house.

327
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,320
It used to scare the crap
out of him when he was a kid.

328
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,870
Back to your old tricks, aren't you?

329
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,680
Getting all emotional
when you needed a lift.

330
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:08,280
Gopu, please.

331
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,110
We were kids back then.

332
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:13,480
But Gopu isn't scared of anyone now.
- I see...

333
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,840
If nothing scares him,
then let him prove it by going inside.

334
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,350
Let's see if he can
really man up and go inside.

335
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,990
Gopu, show them. Show them, Gopu.

336
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,360
Show them how strong you are.

337
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:24,880
Show them, Gopu.
- Show...

338
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,200
See...see

339
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:29,200
Okay, Gopu. You are strongest, Gopu.
You are strongest.

340
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:32,520
Yes, Gopu. Show them.
Show them. Come on!

341
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,160
Stop wasting time.
We've come this far.

342
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:45,720
Have you met Mr. Jamnadas yet?

343
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,590
It doesn't look nice
- Oh s***

344
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:48,880
You're so right.
- Go.

345
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,080
I'll just come.
- Say hello from our side.

346
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,960
I hope he recognizes me. Ja..

347
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,550
Bloody liars.

348
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,280
What a wimp.

349
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,160
Got scared by a girl.

350
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,320
Who is it?

351
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,960
Whose voice is that?
- Chinese cat!

352
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:51,250
Who are you guys?
And, how did you get in?

353
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,960
What did you do?
- We haven't done anything.

354
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:55,330
Who are you guys?

355
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,600
We're here for Mr.
Jamnadas' memorial service.

356
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:00,280
Yes, we spent our childhood here.

357
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:02,880
We were the first
batch of the orphanage.

358
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,400
Yeah.
- Hold on!

359
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,490
Lucky, right?
- Yeah...

360
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,280
And, Madhav.

361
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:19,520
Gopal.

362
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,320
And, Laxmans.
- Woah...

363
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,090
...how do you know?
- You know us?

364
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,360
Of course.

365
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,600
Baba, I know them.

366
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,440
What? Didn't you guys recognize me?
- Who you?

367
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:36,400
Not who? Anna...Anna Mathew, librarian.
- Anna!

368
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:38,440
Oh! Anna Mathew, guys.
- who Anna?

369
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:41,280
Our very own 'Google' for the ghosts.
Library...

370
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,720
Oh yes...

371
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,560
How's your library?

372
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,320
Even if it's empty, she will
say it's infested with ghosts.

373
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,680
she thought we were ghosts.

374
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,690
Who did?
- she did.

375
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,400
She did?

376
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,360
She did ...

377
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,880
She got scared of us...and
we five got scared of her.

378
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:16,490
One minute!
...who are you talking about?

379
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:19,850
Baba, they are talking about Damini.

380
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:23,000
Damini.
You don't have to be scared of her.

381
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,400
She's the house caretaker.

382
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:28,560
Oh, she's the maid.
- Maid...maid.

383
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:30,800
Forget her.

384
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:32,920
Anna, you've grown so tall.

385
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:34,320
Yes, double of you.

386
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,280
Tall, dark, and handsome.

387
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:39,250
Yeah.
- Alright .. Come on, guys.

388
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,490
The rituals are about to begin.

389
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,480
Yeah, we'll talk later.

390
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:54,520
Good morning, ma'am.
- Good Morning.

391
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:55,520
Anna.
- Yeah...

392
00:29:55,610 --> 00:29:58,210
Do you still see ghosts?
- Yes, Gopal.

393
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,960
Gopu.
- Hello, Baba.

394
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,090
Baba, its Dande.

395
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:03,050
Dande, how are you?
- I am fine.

396
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,450
It's a good thing you're here too.

397
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,080
Come on, let's go.
- Go ahead, I'll join you.

398
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:11,040
Look Dande sir, regular
customers of our Police Station.

399
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,960
We're really sad to see you.
- What?

400
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,920
I mean...when we heard
about Mr.Jamnadas.

401
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:16,360
It is very sad.

402
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,560
I know you guys...

403
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,330
Try to act too smart...and I'll
throw you behind bars.

404
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:25,130
Madhav, Gopal, Laxman...
did you recognize me?

405
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,250
No!
- Didn't recognize me?

406
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:29,170
No!
- Didn't recognize me?

407
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:31,570
No!
- Pappi!

408
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:34,360
Not this Pappi (kiss), Pappi bhai.
- Pappi bhai.

409
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:35,930
Pappi bhai...

410
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,650
Pappi bhai...

411
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:40,320
Did you get over your absent-mindedness?
- It was cured long ago.

412
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:43,370
But, Mr. Jamnadas...
There's nothing we can do.

413
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:45,530
Jamnadas was a close friend.

414
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:49,170
We'll always miss him.

415
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,290
Today, on his memorial service...

416
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:55,570
...I would like to call Mr.
Jamnadas' well-wisher,...

417
00:30:55,720 --> 00:31:01,240
...Mr. Vasu Reddy from NV builders.

418
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,290
My mother always used to say...

419
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,720
...everyone's goes to
heaven after they die.

420
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,850
She was absolutely wrong.

421
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:24,210
Mr. Jamnadas built
a paradise while living on earth.

422
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:28,330
This orphanage.
You know, we builders build houses.

423
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:30,130
But he made a home.

424
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:33,770
And, for a better future
for the children of this orphanage...

425
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,370
...before Jamnadas died,...

426
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:41,250
...he transferred over the
orphanage to our company...

427
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,520
...and gave us a big responsibility.

428
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:50,480
Which was that we relocate this
orphanage to a big city like Bengaluru...

429
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:53,600
...and bring a change in
the progress of these children.

430
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:56,050
More incentives, more opportunities.

431
00:31:56,410 --> 00:32:02,410
Jamnadas ji, He treated every child
in the orphanage like his very own.

432
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:06,130
But his most favorite was...

433
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,530
Pappi.

434
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:12,610
Pappi bhai, few words.

435
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:15,850
Please.
- Come on.

436
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:19,090
Go on... What will I say?
- Go now!

437
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:26,240
Jamnadas ji.. to me.. was...

438
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:32,210
He used to feed me
milk with his own hands.

439
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:35,250
He's the one who
raised me since birth.

440
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:39,010
And, he was so naive that...

441
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:43,730
...he passed away while
taking a stroll on the terrace.

442
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,120
This is not done.

443
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:48,730
Anyway...

444
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:56,130
This is how I would like to pay
my respects at his memorial service...

445
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:11,170
Today is Mr.
Jamnadas' birthday.

446
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:12,250
Call the DJ.

447
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:15,200
Cook a feast...look...

448
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:19,250
Look at Mr. Jamnadas...
He's on live-chat with us.

449
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,770
Look at him smile.

450
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:26,000
You guys are here too.

451
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:30,650
Dande... Rascal! You're only one.

452
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:33,170
But you keep saying
you're a sub-inspector.

453
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:36,370
Gandhari, my burnt toast.

454
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:40,570
Madhav, you're
spreading like a fungus.

455
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:43,610
Lucky...

456
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:47,170
Happy Birthday to You!! Sing sing

457
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:50,890
Laxman! My Little Bheem.

458
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:53,610
Even the money plant outside
the orphanage is growing up...

459
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:55,450
...but, you're still
where you started.

460
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:59,410
Laxman no. 2...my slipping tongue.

461
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:04,610
Gopal...when you were a kid,
you looked like Murugan.

462
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:06,530
But now you look like Devgn.

463
00:34:09,970 --> 00:34:12,250
So that was our Jamnadas ji.

464
00:34:12,970 --> 00:34:18,250
Reddy sir, it's a nice thought
to shift the kids from here.

465
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:21,530
In fact,
I have been thinking the same for you.

466
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:25,010
How will you live here
alone...without your daughter?

467
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:28,850
Take my advice, and go to Dubai.
Stay with Nikhil.

468
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:33,330
My company will look after
your house and business.

469
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:34,610
No, Mr. Reddy.

470
00:34:34,930 --> 00:34:37,250
My daughter's memories
dwell in this house.

471
00:34:37,570 --> 00:34:39,050
And Damini's here too.

472
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:41,490
Anna lives with us as well.

473
00:34:42,170 --> 00:34:44,930
In fact, Anna and I have decided...

474
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:47,210
...that we'll rent out two rooms.

475
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:50,170
Even I'll feel better with the
hustle and bustle around the house.

476
00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:52,090
See you.

477
00:34:56,730 --> 00:34:58,170
Bloody old man!

478
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:01,370
I'm trying to empty the house out...

479
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:03,490
...and he's filling
it with more people.

480
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:10,410
Gopal, Mr. Jamnadas wanted only the
best for the children of our orphanage.

481
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:12,930
And, all thanks to
Nikhil and Vasu Reddy...

482
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:15,130
...who have taken upon
this big responsibility.

483
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:17,290
What more can one ask for from god?

484
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:20,090
Just that God gives you
the strength to remember all this.

485
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:21,930
Quiet!

486
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:25,100
Jamnadas left these for you.

487
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:26,690
Some old memories.

488
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:28,370
For me?
- Yes.

489
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:31,650
You were the 'Boney Kapoor'
of this orphanage.

490
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:33,500
We started this venture with you.

491
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:37,130
He was the first child.
- I know, but what is this?

492
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:40,010
Yeshwant,
Mustafa, Ankush, what is all this?

493
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:43,610
Jamnadas was a big fan
of Nana Patekar.

494
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:45,890
How can you forget?
You're so forgetful.

495
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:48,450
He isn't with us anymore,...

496
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:52,730
...but his spirit is watching over us.

497
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:58,330
I feel like he's...right
in front of me.

498
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:02,330
Jamnadas... he's listening to me.

499
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:04,770
Gopu, let's go.

500
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:06,730
It will be dark soon.

501
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:08,250
Come on.

502
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:09,500
Come on.
- Let's go.

503
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:23,570
Hey...what's wrong? Let's go.

504
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:25,450
That chair...

505
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:29,770
What?
- It was swinging on its own.

506
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:32,100
On its own? Really?

507
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:36,050
Must be the wind, stupid! Come on.

508
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:37,930
On its own...

509
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:44,690
Listen...Laxman.

510
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,410
Gopu.

511
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:17,180
What's happened?

512
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:30,660
They came as five, but while
leaving they weren't five but...

513
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:40,410
Laxman, I've put
in a CD of 'Krantiveer'.

514
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,290
Let's watch it together.

515
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:45,740
Come on, Laxman.

516
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:50,890
Come quickly, Laxman.
Nana's going to start talking.

517
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:04,170
Gopal.

518
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:07,820
Jamnadas was murdered.
- Jamnadas?

519
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:11,570
Come, sit.
- Gopal, listen to me.

520
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:13,490
No, I will listen to Nana first.

521
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:15,650
Gopal.
- Na-na.(no-no)

522
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:17,900
Gopal.
- Na-na.( no-no)

523
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:19,900
Gopal.
- Na-na.( no-no)

524
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:21,740
GOPAL!

525
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,490
So now you will only listen to Nana?

526
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:30,620
Nice...nice... A single mosquito
Can turn a man into a eunuch...

527
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:32,140
...similarly it makes
a dead man into a spirit.

528
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:33,300
A single mosquito.

529
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:39,130
Laxman, all that mimicry
of Nana has cleared your tongue.

530
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:42,330
What Laxman? Laxman! You are on with!
This is not a mimicry.

531
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:44,780
Born with a defect in your
thinking you slum dwelling parasite!

532
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:46,260
I am not Laxman.

533
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:49,660
Laxman, look...stop scaring me.

534
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:53,740
Or else I will hit you.

535
00:38:55,730 --> 00:39:00,770
Nice...nice...
What is fear, I'll show you.

536
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:13,140
look...this is called real fear. Look!

537
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:15,740
People with big houses
have small hearts!

538
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,740
Jamnadas was murdered,
He was killed

539
00:39:17,810 --> 00:39:18,660
Nice...Nice...

540
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:20,860
Just because a woman is
fat doesn't mean she is pregnant

541
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:25,620
"The apple of Jamnadas' eye..."

542
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:28,220
"...Listen to what's
going to happen next."

543
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:30,660
"You're going to now..."

544
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:33,500
"...avenge Jamnadas' murder."

545
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:36,290
Nice...

546
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:41,090
Anna...

547
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:46,500
Let me handle this.

548
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:50,060
You two wait here,
I'll go take a look inside.

549
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,420
Gopal, it's okay.

550
00:40:00,090 --> 00:40:01,700
Why are you scared me?

551
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:04,780
Last night you were
sprinting on the walls.

552
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:07,460
I admit that my tongue sticks out...

553
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:09,660
...but that doesn't
mean I am a lizard.

554
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:11,700
How can I sprint on walls?

555
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:34,620
I am not a ghost,
I am your friend.

556
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:37,620
I am real, look.
Touch me. Touch me.

557
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:40,410
See...I am real.

558
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:52,500
It's okay.

559
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:58,410
There is a spirit.

560
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:01,300
There is a spirit?

561
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:03,740
So Gopu was telling the truth.

562
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:05,700
And, in order to drive
this spirit out of here...

563
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:10,860
...I must coordinate with some people
who perform prayers, counseling...

564
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:13,460
...in short,
this process is going to take time.

565
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,860
How much? How much time?

566
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:19,180
At least 40 days.
- 40!

567
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:22,260
In that much time Gopu
will die 40,000 times.

568
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:23,620
Not acceptable.

569
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:26,540
Then, there's only one
way to handle this situation.

570
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:27,580
What?
- Speak.

571
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:29,900
Till the time the spirit
matter is not solved...

572
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:31,900
...you must stay far away from here.

573
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:34,300
Yes... But where?

574
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:36,660
Remember the Colonel's bungalow?

575
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,460
That haunted house.

576
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:39,740
He's renting it out.

577
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:41,780
And, for the past few days
even I have been staying there.

578
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,740
If you want I can speak to him.

579
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:46,780
Gopu, she's also staying there.

580
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:48,380
Yes! yes please speak to him!

581
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:51,900
Till this spirit crisis isn't solved
we will stay with you only Anna.

582
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:54,220
We'll stay with her, Gopu.
- Okay.

583
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:34,160
You scared me.

584
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:35,840
What's wrong?

585
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:37,760
Vasu Reddy's man had come.

586
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:41,200
He said two men are living
at Colonel's place as paying guests.

587
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,080
We've to get them out of there.

588
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,520
I suggest that Laxman, Lucky and me...

589
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,240
...will go over there
as paying guests.

590
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:49,240
We'll scare them out of there.

591
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:52,320
Call Vasu Reddy and tell him.

592
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:54,960
Nice idea.

593
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,040
And, you're already
in your scary character.

594
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:59,890
"Call him and tell him."

595
00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:06,010
Hello.
- Reddy sir, it's Vasooli.

596
00:43:06,490 --> 00:43:09,530
Those two men at Colonel's place...
- Hold on...just hold on.

597
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:11,450
Did you send those two men? rascal

598
00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:15,210
No no... I want to send my three men.
- What?

599
00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:16,890
First two, now three more.

600
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:19,210
Will you make the Colonel's place
into an orphanage as well?

601
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:20,780
No, no Reddy sir.

602
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:23,460
My three men will
go there posing as PGs...

603
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:25,660
...and scare those
two out of the house.

604
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:29,700
I see...I see...
Very good idea. I'll make you rich.

605
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:31,580
Thank you, thank you, sir.

606
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:34,740
Vasooli, just do this job for me.

607
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:37,100
Consider it done.

608
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:40,820
What?
- What?

609
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:41,740
What? Wha?

610
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:44,070
You three go to
Colonel's house as PGs.

611
00:43:44,110 --> 00:43:46,990
And scare the other two
PGs living there out of the house.

612
00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:50,030
You mean we've to scare
those two PGs out of there.

613
00:43:50,310 --> 00:43:52,030
And, we've to go over
at the Colonel's house.

614
00:43:52,270 --> 00:43:53,350
Ooty.

615
00:43:54,030 --> 00:43:55,710
Consider it done. Consider it done.

616
00:43:55,790 --> 00:43:58,790
What's wrong with him? Has he lost it?

617
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:03,110
Why are you moving on your own?

618
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,960
Took all the luggage?

619
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:20,560
Lucky...Madhav...

620
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,760
Woah!
It's the same car.

621
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:25,440
So Gopal and Laxman are inside.

622
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:28,010
So the two paying guests are
none other than Gopal and Laxman.

623
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:29,650
'Baba said he had no problems...'

624
00:44:29,730 --> 00:44:32,090
'...in letting them
stay in his house as PGs.

625
00:44:32,330 --> 00:44:34,650
But Baba didn't know the truth.'

626
00:44:34,730 --> 00:44:37,890
'That they actually had
a problem with each other.'

627
00:44:38,290 --> 00:44:41,570
I am leaving, but Anna will stay here.

628
00:44:42,170 --> 00:44:44,570
You can think that this is her house.

629
00:44:45,290 --> 00:44:48,050
And Damini's here...to
look after all of you.

630
00:44:48,410 --> 00:44:49,450
But, where are you going?

631
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:51,860
It's been 15 days since
my daughter passed away.

632
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:56,220
I'm taking her ashes to Rameshwaram.

633
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:11,620
Laxman...from wherever we are passing,
someone is passing away.

634
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:13,710
Gopu, relax.

635
00:45:14,030 --> 00:45:16,590
Baba, the car's here.

636
00:45:17,310 --> 00:45:18,430
I should leave now.

637
00:45:18,670 --> 00:45:19,790
But your car's here.

638
00:45:19,870 --> 00:45:20,870
Come on.

639
00:45:20,950 --> 00:45:22,310
Gopu...

640
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:24,990
I'll see him out.

641
00:45:25,070 --> 00:45:26,830
Baba, drive safe.
- Baba...

642
00:45:29,350 --> 00:45:30,910
I guess Baba can't see.

643
00:45:33,910 --> 00:45:38,400
So, Gopu...what are you doing here?

644
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,000
Don't you have your own house?

645
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:43,560
Eh First!
it's not a house, it's a bungalow.

646
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:46,040
Yeah, and we're converting
it into a flat. That's why we're here.

647
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:51,160
Who converts a bungalow into a flat?

648
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:55,840
He means...when you see our bungalow
after we've upgraded our interiors...

649
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,410
...you'll fall flat on your face.
Understood.

650
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:01,290
What are you guys doing here?

651
00:46:06,290 --> 00:46:07,530
Even we have a status.

652
00:46:07,730 --> 00:46:08,730
Status?

653
00:46:08,810 --> 00:46:10,930
Even we are getting our interiors done.
- Yeah.

654
00:46:11,010 --> 00:46:13,770
Italian marble, Persian carpet.
And, at the entrance...

655
00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:17,010
Water fountain.

656
00:46:17,770 --> 00:46:20,850
You can't even buy a fountain pen.
Getting a water fountain?

657
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:25,140
Relax, guys. Relax.

658
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:26,780
Come on, pick up your stuff.

659
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:30,220
Maid... is it free?

660
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:32,020
The wifi?

661
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:36,620
Yes, it's absolutely
free... Like you, jobless.

662
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:40,660
Maid...do we get water in the house.

663
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:43,620
It will if you turn on the tap.
- Superb answer!

664
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:46,270
Okay, I'll tell you
who's going to stay where.

665
00:46:46,510 --> 00:46:47,990
You two, up there.

666
00:46:48,070 --> 00:46:49,910
Not that one,
the room next-door is mine.

667
00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:52,190
Which one?
- The room next-door.

668
00:46:54,710 --> 00:46:57,310
And you three, down here okay.
- Woah!

669
00:46:57,830 --> 00:46:59,310
Woah! Woah! Woah!

670
00:46:59,790 --> 00:47:02,110
Excuse me...why will
we stay down here?

671
00:47:02,310 --> 00:47:05,350
And why not upstairs?
- Are you in a hurry to go up?

672
00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:07,950
Gopu, help him.
- Hold on...

673
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:10,320
We're paying rent too.
- Go to hell.

674
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,880
Get lost...

675
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:15,560
Guys! Everyone has to adjust
somewhere, okay?

676
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:16,680
Hey, Ms. Adjust...

677
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:20,440
Don't poke your nose when the
elders are talking. Understand.

678
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:24,560
Don't touch me.
- Hey, don't touch.

679
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:28,280
Why are you coming
In between us for the girl?

680
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:30,280
Yes, why are you in between?
- Yeah...

681
00:47:30,370 --> 00:47:32,130
You're a maid. Maid!
- Yeah.

682
00:47:32,210 --> 00:47:34,250
Your job is to do odd
chores.

683
00:47:34,330 --> 00:47:36,770
To Salute, clean the place.
Lift our luggage.

684
00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:37,930
You're a maid. Maid!

685
00:47:38,610 --> 00:47:40,330
Why are you pushing me?!

686
00:47:40,370 --> 00:47:41,930
Should I give you one?
Should I give you one?

687
00:47:43,250 --> 00:47:44,450
I'll punch you.
- Punch.

688
00:47:44,650 --> 00:47:46,130
I'll punch you.
Punch. Am getting angry

689
00:47:46,210 --> 00:47:48,650
Punch you... On your face.
stomach...everywhere.

690
00:47:48,730 --> 00:47:50,130
Should I? Should I ?

691
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:00,380
Woah...

692
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:02,380
Went deaf, didn't you?

693
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:13,700
Spare me!
- Huh!

694
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:16,820
I mean I am sparing you today.
- Why? What's today?

695
00:48:17,430 --> 00:48:19,270
It's my sister's wedding.
- Huh?

696
00:48:19,350 --> 00:48:21,030
Which sister? What wedding?

697
00:48:21,270 --> 00:48:22,790
It's my namesake sister's
legit wedding.

698
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:25,830
Yeah... And stop clinging to me.

699
00:48:25,910 --> 00:48:28,390
Avenge your friend.
Go on boy go...

700
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:30,590
Yes...

701
00:49:01,490 --> 00:49:03,330
He got scared. He got scared.

702
00:49:03,850 --> 00:49:05,530
Yes...yes...yes...

703
00:49:05,770 --> 00:49:07,010
Kill you.

704
00:49:24,010 --> 00:49:24,900
What's going on here?

705
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:34,780
Look, if you guys want to stay here...

706
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:38,180
...then, we have to all
live together peacefully.

707
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:39,620
Understood! This is not done.

708
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:43,220
Gopal, Anna is absolutely right.

709
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:45,780
Don't be angry. Just relax.

710
00:50:09,310 --> 00:50:12,480
Okay, Gopal.
- Gopu, let's go.

711
00:50:47,690 --> 00:50:48,570
Relax.

712
00:50:48,970 --> 00:50:51,130
Relax. It's me, Gopu.

713
00:50:51,490 --> 00:50:52,730
Come, let's go.

714
00:50:54,010 --> 00:50:55,530
Come on, I'm right here.

715
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:11,140
The family that eats together,
stays together.

716
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:22,110
Let go.
- Exactly...let go.

717
00:51:22,230 --> 00:51:27,790
Gopu, my fingers have surrounded
the fritter from all sides.

718
00:51:27,950 --> 00:51:29,590
And, my fingers...

719
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:35,350
...have surrounded your
fingers from all sides.

720
00:51:36,830 --> 00:51:38,190
Don't be scared, Madhav.

721
00:51:39,150 --> 00:51:40,470
Let go, Gopu.

722
00:51:40,950 --> 00:51:43,920
Otherwise...I'll turn off the lights.

723
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:45,800
Don't be scared, Gopu.

724
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:51,960
If you turn off the light,
I have a candle.

725
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:53,920
Oh sh**

726
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:56,040
Even if we've to go
over your dead bodies...

727
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:59,360
...this fritter will be ours.
- What is this?

728
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:01,280
You guys are fighting over a fritter.

729
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:05,050
This is not just about one fritter.

730
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:07,330
It's about the sauce too!

731
00:52:07,410 --> 00:52:10,650
Let go, Gopu.
- Let go. Let go!

732
00:52:19,810 --> 00:52:20,810
Oh sh**

733
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:29,540
Gopu.

734
00:52:29,740 --> 00:52:30,860
Gopu Ching.

735
00:52:31,580 --> 00:52:34,620
I love Desi Chinese...
- Laxman... Behave yourself.

736
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:37,140
...with my fritter.

737
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:49,470
You're dead.

738
00:52:50,070 --> 00:52:52,150
Gopu, smash...smash them.
- Gopal.

739
00:52:52,990 --> 00:52:54,190
Gopu.

740
00:52:55,590 --> 00:52:56,790
Gopal.

741
00:52:57,350 --> 00:53:03,550
[gibberish]

742
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:16,600
Oh sh**

743
00:53:42,570 --> 00:53:44,010
He has no feelings!

744
00:53:52,410 --> 00:53:53,810
Gopal.

745
00:53:53,890 --> 00:53:56,090
Gopal.
- Stop it! Stop it!

746
00:53:56,170 --> 00:53:58,850
Stop it! What is all this?
Have you guys lost your mind?

747
00:53:59,090 --> 00:54:00,540
Who fights in the house like this?

748
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:03,020
And you Gopal...I am warning you.

749
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:04,820
You're not going to do this again.
Understand.

750
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:07,140
This is a house,
not some wrestling match ring.

751
00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:12,540
I am talking to you, understand.
- Lower your finger.

752
00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:15,420
Gopu, spare me, Gopu spare me.

753
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:17,860
Look, I raised you, cared for you.

754
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:19,790
I fought for your fritter.

755
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:22,990
I'm your baby brother, bro.
For the sake of your brother.

756
00:54:23,070 --> 00:54:27,510
Hey, Laxman, Your words are like
yesterday's rotten pasta to this maniac.

757
00:54:27,590 --> 00:54:30,430
And Gopal, I know you're
like the father figure of us all...

758
00:54:30,510 --> 00:54:33,110
...but he, he is like your
mother... Your mother.

759
00:54:33,310 --> 00:54:36,350
Does one break their mother's finger?

760
00:54:36,430 --> 00:54:38,430
Breaks a finger?
Let go his finger, you madman. Oh shit

761
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:02,800
Gopu... Gopu, no.

762
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:06,360
Gopu...
- Gopu...

763
00:55:06,450 --> 00:55:09,850
Gopal. Gopal.

764
00:55:16,890 --> 00:55:18,570
Gopal! Get down.

765
00:55:18,930 --> 00:55:21,410
Just get down. Just get down.

766
00:55:21,490 --> 00:55:22,610
Get down.

767
00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:32,540
They all deserve it.

768
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:44,540
Jackpot!

769
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:52,270
Stop it!

770
00:55:53,430 --> 00:55:55,030
What are you doing, Gopu?

771
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:33,160
"I looked at you..."

772
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:35,120
"...and flung my heart at you."

773
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:37,240
"You're like an angel from heaven..."

774
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:39,530
"...so say my eyes."

775
00:56:43,690 --> 00:56:45,610
"I looked at you..."

776
00:56:45,810 --> 00:56:47,730
"...and flung my heart at you."

777
00:56:47,810 --> 00:56:49,730
"You're an angel from heaven..."

778
00:56:49,890 --> 00:56:51,850
"...so say my eyes."

779
00:56:51,930 --> 00:56:55,850
"Your face makes the moon conscious."

780
00:56:56,090 --> 00:56:59,570
"Your beauty's intoxication
is touching my heart."

781
00:57:00,140 --> 00:57:03,700
"Who stole your slumber,
sweetheart..."

782
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:05,300
"You did."

783
00:57:05,740 --> 00:57:07,220
"You did."

784
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:11,820
"Who stole your peace, sweetheart..."

785
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:13,300
"You did."

786
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:15,460
"You did."

787
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:26,470
"You're...a madman."

788
00:57:26,670 --> 00:57:28,510
"Why are you after me?"

789
00:57:28,750 --> 00:57:32,710
"All lines from this route are busy."

790
00:57:32,870 --> 00:57:34,830
"Lock eyes with me..."

791
00:57:34,870 --> 00:57:36,790
"...let the news spread."

792
00:57:36,950 --> 00:57:38,990
"I can't control myself any longer..."

793
00:57:39,070 --> 00:57:40,670
"...because you're so amazing."

794
00:57:41,430 --> 00:57:45,350
"There are no sorrows
in your life right now."

795
00:57:45,550 --> 00:57:49,040
"But he will make your
days and night empty."

796
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:53,000
"Who stole my slumber, sweetheart..."

797
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:54,840
"You did."

798
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:56,800
"You did."

799
00:57:57,720 --> 00:58:01,120
"Who stole your peace, sweetheart..."

800
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:02,680
"You did."

801
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:04,880
"You did."

802
00:58:30,570 --> 00:58:31,730
It's okay, Lucky.

803
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:35,340
It's okay,
don't worry I'll fix it now.

804
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:36,420
Okay.

805
00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:47,060
What? From ten your
fingers became eight?

806
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:48,900
He's saying its straight not eight.

807
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:51,620
But hello, how did you do it?

808
00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:53,100
Magic.

809
00:59:07,430 --> 00:59:08,630
Laxman.
- Gopu.

810
00:59:08,710 --> 00:59:10,910
Laxman! Laxman! Laxman! Laxman
- What happened, Gopu?

811
00:59:10,990 --> 00:59:13,230
Baba's dead daughter!
Baba's dead daughter!

812
00:59:13,590 --> 00:59:14,550
Where?

813
00:59:14,630 --> 00:59:16,310
Gopu.
- What?

814
00:59:16,670 --> 00:59:19,920
Did we turn off the gas back home?

815
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:23,520
Sorry, sorry, sorry...I forgot. sorry

816
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:25,240
Let's go back to sleep. Good Boy

817
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:27,640
Don't be scared. Come here come here

818
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,320
Gopu. gopu

819
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:31,280
Okay.

820
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:35,200
Okay, Gopu.

821
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:38,720
"The apple of Jamnadas' eye..."

822
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:41,730
"...and Laxman's Gopala."

823
00:59:42,050 --> 00:59:45,010
"Our very own ghostbuster..."

824
00:59:45,210 --> 00:59:47,690
"...Anna is downstairs."

825
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:08,780
Hey, maid...listen.

826
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:10,700
Don't you get paid?
- Why?

827
01:00:10,780 --> 01:00:12,500
You wear the same dress every day.
- Yeah.

828
01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:15,460
This is my uniform.
Colonel sir gave it to me.

829
01:00:15,540 --> 01:00:16,660
The Colonel.

830
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:19,540
But the Colonel is blind.
You can change, he won't know.

831
01:00:20,780 --> 01:00:21,940
Just shut up.

832
01:00:24,220 --> 01:00:28,430
Lucky, there's definitely
something between her and Anna.

833
01:00:30,110 --> 01:00:31,310
Not like that.

834
01:00:31,630 --> 01:00:33,750
But these two are definitely
Some planning.

835
01:00:36,590 --> 01:00:40,550
O Sun Lord, protect me from ghosts,
spirits, black magic...

836
01:00:40,630 --> 01:00:45,910
...and also Nana Patekar that sprint
on walls, and open hair witches.

837
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:53,640
Got Scared?
- No.

838
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:58,720
Oh! my my, what is
this madman doing with the house maid.

839
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:00,200
What are you doing
here in the morning?

840
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:03,600
Morning meditation.

841
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:05,080
It's so spacious out here.

842
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:07,480
Yeah, it's beautiful.

843
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:08,800
Come come...

844
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:13,410
Tell me something, Gopu.

845
01:01:14,490 --> 01:01:17,050
The five of you grew up together.

846
01:01:17,570 --> 01:01:19,410
You and Laxman are soo close also.

847
01:01:19,930 --> 01:01:22,130
So, what is your problem
with the other three?

848
01:01:22,610 --> 01:01:24,530
They are not all that bad.

849
01:01:25,770 --> 01:01:27,850
Yes, Damini. You're right.

850
01:01:28,770 --> 01:01:30,010
They are not that bad.

851
01:01:34,050 --> 01:01:36,940
But They are very bad,
rascals and scoundrel type of people

852
01:01:37,020 --> 01:01:38,340
Why you...fool

853
01:01:41,420 --> 01:01:43,180
Gopal, I have to say...

854
01:01:43,580 --> 01:01:47,300
Whoever you marry, that one will be Lucky.
- Marry Lucky?

855
01:01:47,420 --> 01:01:50,660
Not that Lucky,
I meant extremely fortunate.

856
01:01:50,860 --> 01:01:52,420
You got safe.
- Why?

857
01:01:52,660 --> 01:01:57,380
Because every girl wants a tall,
dark, and handsome boy.

858
01:01:58,030 --> 01:02:01,630
And, you have all these qualities.
you're innocent too.

859
01:02:03,830 --> 01:02:06,510
Oh no, I completely forgot.
Anna's has been looking for me.

860
01:02:06,590 --> 01:02:08,910
I will see you later, okay.
Bye.

861
01:02:09,150 --> 01:02:10,470
Gopu's falling
head-over-heels for her.

862
01:02:10,830 --> 01:02:12,150
Come come come ...
Gopu!

863
01:02:12,230 --> 01:02:13,670
Gopu! Gopu!

864
01:02:13,990 --> 01:02:15,910
Gopu, This situation
reminds me of a poem.

865
01:02:15,990 --> 01:02:17,470
Please...do tell.

866
01:02:18,270 --> 01:02:19,720
"When early in the morning..."

867
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:20,840
"...someone says make me yours."

868
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:22,360
"It clearly indicates
the time has come..."

869
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:24,640
"...open a pack of hair-dye,
mix and apply."

870
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:25,560
Wow!

871
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:26,880
You like her?

872
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:29,560
No-no.. It's nothing like that.

873
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:32,880
We're just hello - hi.
- What kind?

874
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:35,520
hi...or hiiiii.

875
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:36,640
We were watching everything.

876
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:39,760
Quiet.

877
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:44,970
Laxman, I think Damini
is in love with Gopu.

878
01:02:45,090 --> 01:02:48,330
Lovely...
- No, no, it's not...

879
01:02:48,410 --> 01:02:49,730
It's exactly like that.

880
01:02:50,050 --> 01:02:52,290
She's been going crazy looking
for you since morning.

881
01:02:52,370 --> 01:02:54,570
Where is Gopu? I don't see him. where?
- Can't see.

882
01:02:54,650 --> 01:02:58,530
She's been driving us crazy Gopu.
She's pining for you.

883
01:02:59,610 --> 01:03:01,130
What?

884
01:03:02,130 --> 01:03:06,250
I want Gopal. I want Gopal.

885
01:03:07,660 --> 01:03:08,860
You guys are too much!

886
01:03:11,980 --> 01:03:14,460
We got this madman
bowled over romance.

887
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:18,700
Tonight he'll be visited
by the ghost of love.

888
01:03:23,540 --> 01:03:27,230
Tangabali Kita verede

889
01:03:28,380 --> 01:03:30,870
"But love never obeyed
any age restrictions."

890
01:03:31,190 --> 01:03:33,550
"One of the partner's
has to be younger."

891
01:03:34,110 --> 01:03:35,270
"Prince..."

892
01:03:39,710 --> 01:03:43,670
"Please don't hesitate
in telling me that you love me."

893
01:03:50,670 --> 01:03:54,080
Lamhe...exactly your story.

894
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:56,200
Meaning.

895
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:58,760
Childhood...old age...

896
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:01,040
I am only joking.

897
01:04:03,120 --> 01:04:07,000
That girl Damini...she's called you.

898
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:09,800
Me?
- Yes...in the basement.

899
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:14,970
In The basement?
- Oh, what happened Gopu...

900
01:04:16,090 --> 01:04:18,330
Won't you go alone in the basement?

901
01:04:20,010 --> 01:04:21,210
Says who?

902
01:04:30,850 --> 01:04:31,930
He's coming.

903
01:04:32,010 --> 01:04:34,210
We'll scare him so bad today...

904
01:04:34,290 --> 01:04:36,220
...that he'll will leave
the house and Ooty also.

905
01:04:46,860 --> 01:04:48,060
Damini...

906
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:51,820
Damini...

907
01:05:21,590 --> 01:05:24,880
That was nice... Very nice...

908
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:28,280
But it's going to
be bad for you... Very bad.

909
01:05:47,170 --> 01:05:49,090
No...

910
01:05:51,530 --> 01:05:53,810
Gopal!

911
01:06:04,810 --> 01:06:07,650
Greedy boys... Our own
dogs are biting our flesh!

912
01:06:07,690 --> 01:06:10,100
And distributing us like bones!

913
01:06:22,740 --> 01:06:24,780
Gopu, let us go.

914
01:06:54,780 --> 01:06:56,900
Reddy sir,
I don't know what's wrong with Gopal.

915
01:06:57,020 --> 01:06:57,980
We tried to scare him...

916
01:06:58,060 --> 01:07:01,540
...but he scared us more in return.
- Please do something.

917
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:04,180
My mother always said...

918
01:07:04,250 --> 01:07:06,370
Your mother was always spoke wrong.

919
01:07:06,450 --> 01:07:08,730
Forget her... Just tell us what to do.

920
01:07:10,450 --> 01:07:11,290
Burn that house down.

921
01:07:11,370 --> 01:07:12,290
What?
- Burn it down?

922
01:07:12,370 --> 01:07:14,330
I'm only concerned about the plot.

923
01:07:14,690 --> 01:07:16,960
Burn it down.
- How can we just burn it down?

924
01:07:17,410 --> 01:07:18,970
Payment doubled.

925
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:21,850
You think we'll commit this sin for money?
- Yeah...

926
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,440
There are people in that house.

927
01:07:23,530 --> 01:07:26,680
You know, my mother used to say.
- Let your mother be...

928
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:29,320
Consider the house burnt.

929
01:07:33,950 --> 01:07:36,190
What's with you?
Why are you quiet?

930
01:07:36,790 --> 01:07:38,190
You've lost your mind, Madhav.

931
01:07:38,350 --> 01:07:39,470
You're risking everyone's life.

932
01:07:39,550 --> 01:07:40,750
Yeah...
- Burn that house down.

933
01:07:40,990 --> 01:07:43,470
There's Gopal, Laxman,
Anna... and that maid in that house.

934
01:07:43,550 --> 01:07:44,710
What if something happens to them?

935
01:07:44,780 --> 01:07:46,190
Everyone will be safe.

936
01:07:46,460 --> 01:07:48,310
There's a birthday party tomorrow.
- Whose birthday?

937
01:07:48,380 --> 01:07:50,260
Everyone.
- Everyone?

938
01:07:50,780 --> 01:07:52,580
Don't you remember, Lucky?

939
01:07:52,660 --> 01:07:55,180
Mr. Jamnadas would choose one day...

940
01:07:55,260 --> 01:07:57,340
...to celebrate everyone's birthday,
remember?

941
01:07:57,500 --> 01:07:58,580
I remember.
- Correct.

942
01:07:58,660 --> 01:08:00,020
And, there's a similar
birthday party tomorrow.

943
01:08:00,820 --> 01:08:02,140
Understand.

944
01:08:02,180 --> 01:08:04,490
So, when Gopal and Laxman
will be busy decorating...

945
01:08:04,850 --> 01:08:07,810
...we'll sneak out and burn
that old man's house down.

946
01:08:08,650 --> 01:08:10,570
And there won't be anyone.
- Woah.

947
01:08:10,650 --> 01:08:11,570
Okay!

948
01:08:11,650 --> 01:08:18,450
kids, am going to sing you a song,
listen closely to the tune,...

949
01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:26,720
Where are you going?
Come back.. listen to me.

950
01:08:35,270 --> 01:08:39,310
Look where you're sprinkling that
thing. Do it properly...go there.. go.

951
01:09:18,890 --> 01:09:20,200
Madhav...fire!
Oh shit!

952
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:22,160
Lucky crazy, have you gone mad?

953
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:23,800
Setting your brother's bum on fire.
What have you done?

954
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:27,320
Lucky, have you lost your mind? Lucky

955
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:31,030
Has some ghost possessed your brain?
- Not just my brain, you greedy boys.

956
01:09:32,030 --> 01:09:33,910
Its controlling my entire body.

957
01:09:36,750 --> 01:09:39,030
He spoke.
- Lucky spoke.

958
01:09:39,590 --> 01:09:41,230
Lucky spoke.
- Yes, he spoke.

959
01:09:42,150 --> 01:09:44,390
He spoke well. Spoke well!

960
01:09:46,340 --> 01:09:47,670
I'm sitting right here.

961
01:09:48,980 --> 01:09:50,540
Let's see who burns this house down?

962
01:09:50,580 --> 01:09:53,300
Run! Run! Ghost. Ghost.

963
01:09:53,370 --> 01:09:59,460
Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire!
- His's bum on fire.

964
01:09:59,530 --> 01:10:04,050
Gopu...Lucky's been possessed.
He's talking.

965
01:10:04,610 --> 01:10:07,850
Madhav, I admit I am not very smart.
But this is too much.

966
01:10:07,930 --> 01:10:11,210
He's talking... He's
turned into Nana Patekar.

967
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:13,640
Lucky's talking.
- he is Speaking.

968
01:10:14,330 --> 01:10:16,120
I'll take a look.
- Don't go, Gopu. I am warning you.

969
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:18,800
Gopu, he's been possessed.
- Relax, he's Gopu.

970
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:20,320
He's not scared of anyone.
He's strongest.

971
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:22,720
He's been possessed.
- Shut up.

972
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:28,960
They say you spoke.

973
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:32,110
That you've been possessed.

974
01:10:32,830 --> 01:10:34,110
Say something...

975
01:10:34,590 --> 01:10:37,190
Hey...what are you saying?

976
01:10:38,750 --> 01:10:41,430
Madhav, he's stopped
talking even in sign language.

977
01:10:42,870 --> 01:10:44,100
Superb, Gopu. superb

978
01:10:44,270 --> 01:10:47,220
You guys are uselessly trying to scare me...
- now you will hear my voice now?

979
01:10:50,060 --> 01:10:51,220
Oh, s***

980
01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:55,780
What? your eyes have popped out?
Soon your tongue will also stick out.

981
01:10:57,220 --> 01:10:58,530
And what are you saying speak speak!

982
01:10:58,610 --> 01:11:01,210
Do I look like All India radio that will
keep playing for you the whole day?

983
01:11:01,300 --> 01:11:03,010
Papa Natekar's is here!
Papa Natekar's is here!

984
01:11:03,090 --> 01:11:05,690
Anna! Anna!

985
01:11:10,250 --> 01:11:12,850
No, no I cannot stay here.
- Hold on, Gopal. Wait. One minute

986
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:14,880
No, please.
- Wait, Gopal, listen to me.

987
01:11:14,970 --> 01:11:16,000
Listen to what, Anna?

988
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:18,120
That spirit has followed
me all the way here.

989
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:19,640
First, he possessed
Laxman and scared me.

990
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:20,880
And now I wonder what
it was going to do to me...

991
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:22,350
...after possessing Lucky's body?

992
01:11:22,790 --> 01:11:25,430
Sooner or later this
spirit's going to kill me.

993
01:11:26,070 --> 01:11:27,830
And, you guys will
also die because of me.

994
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:29,430
Look at poor Lucky's condition.

995
01:11:30,110 --> 01:11:31,870
I don't think after today he
will ever get up again.

996
01:11:38,710 --> 01:11:39,990
Laxman, water.

997
01:11:41,590 --> 01:11:43,820
He's awake, I meant water to drink.

998
01:11:44,230 --> 01:11:45,180
You...

999
01:11:45,460 --> 01:11:49,260
Madhav, Gopal, what's happened?

1000
01:11:50,170 --> 01:11:51,980
You were possessed by a ghost.

1001
01:11:52,050 --> 01:11:54,140
Gopu, why are you talking like him?

1002
01:11:54,210 --> 01:11:55,930
Why am I talking like him?

1003
01:11:57,180 --> 01:11:58,570
You were possessed by a ghost.

1004
01:12:00,090 --> 01:12:04,250
Madhav, Laxman...I am
responsible for your plight.

1005
01:12:05,890 --> 01:12:08,320
I admit that we never got along...

1006
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:10,720
...but, at least we share a bond.

1007
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:13,680
I cannot risk your lives.

1008
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,720
I cannot stay here, Anna. Let's go, Lucky.
- Wait, Gopal.

1009
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:21,990
If anyone should leave,
then it should be us three.

1010
01:12:22,270 --> 01:12:24,520
We were going to burn this house down.

1011
01:12:25,670 --> 01:12:27,670
Remember Vasu Reddy, the builder...

1012
01:12:27,950 --> 01:12:29,270
...he was at the memorial service too.

1013
01:12:30,470 --> 01:12:31,950
He has his eyes on this plot.

1014
01:12:33,230 --> 01:12:36,110
He paid us to burn this house down.

1015
01:12:36,310 --> 01:12:37,750
And, you guys agreed.

1016
01:12:38,100 --> 01:12:40,500
Anna, I didn't know that
things would get out of hand.

1017
01:12:42,300 --> 01:12:45,100
Sorry, Gopal. You won't leave alone.

1018
01:12:45,180 --> 01:12:46,260
We will all go with you.

1019
01:12:46,420 --> 01:12:48,540
Yes, and if that spirit returns...

1020
01:12:48,820 --> 01:12:53,010
...we...we... will run together.
- Superb idea.

1021
01:12:53,690 --> 01:12:54,780
Yes, Gopal.

1022
01:12:54,980 --> 01:12:57,610
We're together.
- All together

1023
01:13:07,970 --> 01:13:10,280
Anna, don't worry about Reddy.

1024
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:12,080
We'll handle him.

1025
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:15,520
And Anna, thanks for
everything you've done.

1026
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:17,640
See you soon.
- Hold on.

1027
01:13:19,150 --> 01:13:20,440
If you guys really want to leave...

1028
01:13:20,510 --> 01:13:22,230
...then,
why don't you all leave tomorrow.

1029
01:13:22,870 --> 01:13:24,240
Right?
- Yes.

1030
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:27,430
Along with you guys,
It's the children's birthday.

1031
01:13:27,830 --> 01:13:30,150
They will be sad if
We aren't there with them.

1032
01:13:30,510 --> 01:13:32,990
Just for one day, stay.

1033
01:13:33,630 --> 01:13:34,830
Gopu.
- Yeah.

1034
01:13:35,140 --> 01:13:39,300
When a beautiful girl says 'stay',
then it clearly indicates...

1035
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:42,340
What? - Just like we tell our dogs,
'Moti, stay'...

1036
01:13:42,420 --> 01:13:44,980
... she's telling you 'Gopu, stay'.

1037
01:13:46,580 --> 01:13:47,980
Gopu.

1038
01:13:48,650 --> 01:13:51,210
Let to.
- Gopu...

1039
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:12,000
"We're stubborn."

1040
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:15,470
"We aren't going to Agree."

1041
01:14:15,750 --> 01:14:23,190
"We will continue doing mischiefs."

1042
01:14:24,030 --> 01:14:29,750
"Tell the world..."

1043
01:14:30,030 --> 01:14:37,390
"Don't take away...our freedom."

1044
01:14:38,220 --> 01:14:41,180
"I want to say what's in my heart."

1045
01:14:41,380 --> 01:14:44,970
"We're going to stay the way we are."

1046
01:14:45,620 --> 01:14:49,090
"One life...not too much, but..."

1047
01:14:49,180 --> 01:14:51,650
"...we're going to
be a little naughtier."

1048
01:14:51,730 --> 01:14:55,010
"We will never change."

1049
01:14:55,330 --> 01:14:58,610
"We will never change."

1050
01:14:58,970 --> 01:15:02,240
"We'll get naughtier."

1051
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:06,650
"We will never change."

1052
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:21,520
"We won't lose...these
moments of mischief."

1053
01:15:21,550 --> 01:15:25,110
"We'll never let sorrows...
get in the way of our happiness."

1054
01:15:25,190 --> 01:15:29,950
"We'll let life smile."

1055
01:15:32,350 --> 01:15:35,820
"We won't lose...these
moments of mischief."

1056
01:15:35,910 --> 01:15:39,450
"We'll never let sorrows...
get in the way of our happiness."

1057
01:15:39,540 --> 01:15:44,380
"We'll let life smile."

1058
01:15:46,530 --> 01:15:52,970
"We'll drench ourselves...
in this deluge of dreams."

1059
01:15:53,970 --> 01:15:59,890
"We're gonna do...
what we've never done."

1060
01:15:59,970 --> 01:16:03,280
"We will never change."

1061
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:06,840
"We will never change."

1062
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:10,480
"We'll get naughtier."

1063
01:16:10,760 --> 01:16:14,120
"We will never change."

1064
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:17,670
"We will never change."

1065
01:16:17,990 --> 01:16:21,190
"We will never change."

1066
01:16:21,590 --> 01:16:24,830
"We'll get naughtier."

1067
01:16:25,190 --> 01:16:29,390
"We will never change."

1068
01:16:45,940 --> 01:16:50,730
And then, that day also came ,
when I was about to tell..

1069
01:16:50,810 --> 01:16:56,290
..them something that was going
to change their lives forever.

1070
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:05,240
Gopu, before we leave...

1071
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:07,640
...you must do this.
- What?

1072
01:17:07,710 --> 01:17:11,470
Say "I love you" to her.
- Yeah.

1073
01:17:12,270 --> 01:17:15,350
Are you mad?
- What are you scared of?

1074
01:17:15,630 --> 01:17:16,950
Age difference.

1075
01:17:17,190 --> 01:17:20,510
Gopu! Every girl looks for a
father-figure in her companion.

1076
01:17:20,870 --> 01:17:22,390
She's got the figure,
you're the father.

1077
01:17:22,910 --> 01:17:25,420
Madhav...
- Don't be scared.

1078
01:17:25,510 --> 01:17:27,060
Go, confess Gopu.

1079
01:17:27,140 --> 01:17:29,860
Propose to her. Gopu...don't hesitate.

1080
01:17:29,940 --> 01:17:34,780
Go...go...you have to go.
- Go Gopu go...good boy.

1081
01:17:45,970 --> 01:17:48,370
What I was saying, child...
- Huh!

1082
01:17:49,650 --> 01:17:51,250
My coffee's still left.

1083
01:17:53,170 --> 01:17:56,120
Oh, that reminds me..."Cheeni"
Have you seen 'Cheeni Kum'?

1084
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:57,480
What?

1085
01:17:57,560 --> 01:17:59,640
The love story between
the hero and heroine was amazing.

1086
01:18:00,680 --> 01:18:02,560
Yeah...
- Madhav.

1087
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:04,600
Laxman, Lucky, where is everyone?

1088
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:07,040
Madhav, Lucky, Laxman...

1089
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:10,670
It's such a big house,
what are you guys doing outside?

1090
01:18:10,750 --> 01:18:12,110
The person lost in the
morning returned home now only

1091
01:18:12,790 --> 01:18:14,150
Pappi, what are you doing here?

1092
01:18:14,230 --> 01:18:15,790
I'm here to show you guys something.

1093
01:18:15,870 --> 01:18:18,750
Take a look at yesterday's photographs.
- Show me...

1094
01:18:19,990 --> 01:18:21,710
Superb.
- Nice.

1095
01:18:22,590 --> 01:18:23,630
Superb.

1096
01:18:23,790 --> 01:18:26,060
look at this one.
- That shirt's looking nice.

1097
01:18:26,980 --> 01:18:30,660
You're there, you're there...I
am there, so are you and you...

1098
01:18:30,860 --> 01:18:33,300
...but, where's the kid?
- Where's the kid? Oh yes.

1099
01:18:34,380 --> 01:18:36,210
She's not there.
- Yeah.

1100
01:18:37,090 --> 01:18:38,770
Even his camera is
absent-minded like him.

1101
01:18:38,850 --> 01:18:40,210
Forgot to take her pictures.

1102
01:18:40,290 --> 01:18:41,250
Whose picture?

1103
01:18:41,340 --> 01:18:43,170
Damini.
- Damini?

1104
01:18:43,250 --> 01:18:44,930
Yeah.
- Damini, who? Whose Damini

1105
01:18:45,050 --> 01:18:47,770
Gopal's girlfriend, Damini.
- Damini is my girlfriend.

1106
01:18:47,850 --> 01:18:49,930
Woah...
- Madhav. Madhav.

1107
01:18:50,290 --> 01:18:51,320
He's forgotten again.

1108
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:53,530
I haven't forgotten anything.

1109
01:18:53,610 --> 01:18:57,130
My wedding's been fixed with Damini!
The wedding is next month.

1110
01:18:57,370 --> 01:18:58,880
He's definitely forgotten.

1111
01:19:00,040 --> 01:19:01,680
I haven't forgotten anything.

1112
01:19:07,630 --> 01:19:10,870
She! She! She's my Damini.
- Pappi bhai...

1113
01:19:11,070 --> 01:19:13,910
Pappi bhai, what are you doing?
- Who hung my darlings photograph like this?

1114
01:19:13,990 --> 01:19:15,590
Pappi bhai, she isn't Damini.

1115
01:19:15,670 --> 01:19:18,070
That's the Colonel's daughter
who died in an accident.

1116
01:19:18,350 --> 01:19:21,630
She is not that Colonel's daughter,
She is Damini, she is the caretaker.

1117
01:19:21,700 --> 01:19:23,270
And she's alive.

1118
01:19:23,940 --> 01:19:24,750
Look.

1119
01:19:24,820 --> 01:19:27,980
You took this snap when she was alive.

1120
01:19:28,060 --> 01:19:29,260
Yes! .. You forgot
- I see...

1121
01:19:29,340 --> 01:19:30,940
Then let's talk to her on video-call.

1122
01:19:33,180 --> 01:19:37,460
Sweetheart Pappi... Do you
want a kiss on video-chat again?

1123
01:19:37,530 --> 01:19:39,380
Don't waste time...

1124
01:19:39,890 --> 01:19:40,930
Now get lost.

1125
01:19:41,020 --> 01:19:43,410
If she's Damini, and she's alive.

1126
01:19:43,730 --> 01:19:46,290
Then who's that Damini with Gopu?
- Where is she?

1127
01:19:46,450 --> 01:19:48,160
Outside.
- I'll take a look. Come on.

1128
01:19:51,680 --> 01:19:54,240
Who is it?
Where is she? He's sitting all alone.

1129
01:19:54,840 --> 01:19:56,130
Look.

1130
01:19:58,240 --> 01:19:59,880
There's Damini sitting with him.

1131
01:20:01,160 --> 01:20:03,600
You guys have lost
your mind like Gopal.

1132
01:20:03,880 --> 01:20:05,910
We just spoke to Damini on video-chat.

1133
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,590
He forgot again. Come here.

1134
01:20:08,310 --> 01:20:10,630
I haven't forgotten anything.
- Oh Shit.

1135
01:20:11,110 --> 01:20:13,950
Gopal's is sitting there alone.
I haven't forgotten anything.

1136
01:20:14,230 --> 01:20:16,750
Damini, the care-taker of this house
is my girlfriend.

1137
01:20:16,830 --> 01:20:19,500
She isn't in this house,
or the courtyard...or the garden.

1138
01:20:19,580 --> 01:20:20,700
I haven't forgotten anything.

1139
01:20:20,780 --> 01:20:24,100
Madhav, if that is
Damini the maid's picture.

1140
01:20:24,190 --> 01:20:25,940
And she's Damini the maid.

1141
01:20:26,020 --> 01:20:28,100
Then, who is the Colonel's
daughter that's dead?

1142
01:20:28,180 --> 01:20:29,650
Colonel's daughter?
- Yes.

1143
01:20:31,460 --> 01:20:32,580
She is the Colonel's daughter.

1144
01:20:33,490 --> 01:20:37,140
That's...that's...
- She is dead!

1145
01:20:37,180 --> 01:20:40,810
I attended her cremation 17 days ago.
- What?

1146
01:20:40,890 --> 01:20:43,410
If you don't believe me,
then search on Google.

1147
01:20:43,890 --> 01:20:45,720
I'll check on my phone.
Excuse me!

1148
01:20:45,770 --> 01:20:46,770
Show me...

1149
01:20:57,560 --> 01:21:01,120
Pappi, for the sake of your mother...

1150
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:02,400
...you really don't see her?

1151
01:21:02,470 --> 01:21:06,350
There's no one out there.
Gopal's all alone.

1152
01:21:06,510 --> 01:21:09,550
But we can still see her...

1153
01:21:10,830 --> 01:21:12,630
That means she's a ghost.

1154
01:21:13,150 --> 01:21:16,180
And my Gopu, who's afraid of ghosts...

1155
01:21:16,270 --> 01:21:19,180
...is going to say I love you
to a ghost. - S***

1156
01:21:19,260 --> 01:21:20,860
Someone stop him.

1157
01:21:21,030 --> 01:21:23,660
Gopu...Gopu...Gopal.

1158
01:21:26,780 --> 01:21:28,340
What happened?
- Gopu...

1159
01:21:28,580 --> 01:21:29,780
What?
- Come here.

1160
01:21:30,770 --> 01:21:31,580
Come here.

1161
01:21:33,170 --> 01:21:34,290
Just a minute.

1162
01:21:38,570 --> 01:21:39,530
What is it?

1163
01:21:41,330 --> 01:21:42,890
First, you guys send me
out there and then call me back.

1164
01:21:42,970 --> 01:21:44,090
How are you Pappi?

1165
01:21:44,610 --> 01:21:45,840
What is it?
- Listen...

1166
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:49,840
Gopu...that Damini, she's not a girl.

1167
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:51,920
Is she a boy?
- She's not a boy.

1168
01:21:52,120 --> 01:21:54,040
Is she both?
- She's neither. Gopu

1169
01:21:54,120 --> 01:21:55,120
Then what is she?

1170
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:58,680
I'll tell you. She's a spirit.
- A ghost.

1171
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:01,800
She's a ghost!
- Yes.

1172
01:22:06,310 --> 01:22:08,270
Madhav, just because
I am scared of ghosts...

1173
01:22:08,350 --> 01:22:09,630
And, you too Laxman.

1174
01:22:09,710 --> 01:22:13,980
Seriously, it's very important. Show him
- See...the Colonel's daughter.

1175
01:22:14,110 --> 01:22:15,380
Ghost.

1176
01:22:15,470 --> 01:22:17,630
Accident... Kunnur Ghat.

1177
01:22:18,300 --> 01:22:21,380
Trying to scare me
with this fake Google.

1178
01:22:22,220 --> 01:22:23,700
Here, only she is standing Damini.

1179
01:22:25,250 --> 01:22:26,740
Stop over acting you guys.

1180
01:22:26,820 --> 01:22:29,660
And you...you're trying to scare me...

1181
01:22:31,650 --> 01:22:34,050
Did you miss, Gopu?

1182
01:22:34,130 --> 01:22:38,970
Try again...be sure, Gopu.
- Please, don't do this.

1183
01:22:47,850 --> 01:22:49,480
They are speaking the truth, Gopal.

1184
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:51,520
I am the Colonel's daughter.

1185
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:54,320
And, I died 17 days ago.

1186
01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:01,320
Please!

1187
01:23:02,990 --> 01:23:04,710
Mummy!

1188
01:23:05,510 --> 01:23:08,230
Gopu...

1189
01:23:09,340 --> 01:23:13,220
Gopu, relax... It's a ghost!
- Gopu.

1190
01:23:29,110 --> 01:23:30,390
Ghost.

1191
01:23:34,700 --> 01:23:38,850
Listen to me, Gopu.
- Ghost.

1192
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:48,640
Listen to me, guys.

1193
01:23:48,720 --> 01:23:56,250
Please let us go
What wrong have we done to you?

1194
01:23:56,320 --> 01:23:58,880
Guys listen to me please

1195
01:24:00,320 --> 01:24:01,280
Don't be scared, Madhav.

1196
01:24:01,870 --> 01:24:03,990
Enough... enough Madhav.

1197
01:24:04,510 --> 01:24:08,480
Wait... I know how
to deal with this banshee.

1198
01:24:08,760 --> 01:24:10,640
What? What?
- Let me show you.

1199
01:24:12,230 --> 01:24:14,790
WOAH!
- Is this Star Plus?

1200
01:24:15,100 --> 01:24:16,150
Be Quiet.

1201
01:24:16,220 --> 01:24:18,300
Every Diwali is not a bonus.
Every pimple is not a puss.

1202
01:24:18,380 --> 01:24:20,260
And every cross is not Star Plus.

1203
01:24:21,060 --> 01:24:23,530
It's a Cross from the Hollywood horror films.
- Cross.

1204
01:24:23,620 --> 01:24:25,940
And these ghostly people can't cross it.
- Really?

1205
01:24:26,020 --> 01:24:29,100
But where is this ghost person?
Is it on the Left or the right? Where?

1206
01:24:29,140 --> 01:24:31,740
She's right here in front.
Now don't disturb.

1207
01:24:31,810 --> 01:24:32,810
Concentrate.

1208
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:36,240
Hoo-ka-baa

1209
01:24:38,560 --> 01:24:39,650
Hoo-ka-baa!

1210
01:24:42,050 --> 01:24:43,570
Hoo-ka-baa

1211
01:24:47,640 --> 01:24:49,000
She's scared.
- It's working.

1212
01:24:49,080 --> 01:24:50,320
Very good.
- The power of the cross.

1213
01:24:50,390 --> 01:24:51,750
Go on...
- Hoo-ka-baa

1214
01:24:52,950 --> 01:24:54,990
I will destroy you, demoness.

1215
01:24:55,230 --> 01:24:56,790
Run away you vampire.

1216
01:24:57,070 --> 01:24:59,190
Witch... Once there was an enchantress

1217
01:24:59,270 --> 01:25:01,750
Conjuring Part 1, part 2.

1218
01:25:02,470 --> 01:25:03,580
Get lost from here.

1219
01:25:03,790 --> 01:25:05,630
Woah!

1220
01:25:11,970 --> 01:25:13,700
Are you okay? Laxman

1221
01:25:19,410 --> 01:25:20,980
Laxman...
- Why aren't you guys saying anything?

1222
01:25:21,050 --> 01:25:21,970
Why are you silent?

1223
01:25:22,930 --> 01:25:25,160
Hello-hello-hello...3,
2, 1, testing...

1224
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:28,130
Rampur's Laxman.

1225
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:31,280
Pappi...even you lost
your voice like Lucky.

1226
01:25:32,810 --> 01:25:35,050
We have not gone mute,
you've gone deaf.

1227
01:25:35,160 --> 01:25:36,490
Hoo-ka-baa! Hoo-ka-baa

1228
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:39,320
I know she's gone, but why
are'nt you guys saying anything.

1229
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:41,120
That's what we are trying to do

1230
01:25:42,520 --> 01:25:44,750
He's deaf, he's dumb, I am blind.

1231
01:25:44,830 --> 01:25:46,230
I can't see the banshee.

1232
01:25:46,710 --> 01:25:47,630
What do we do, Pappi?

1233
01:25:48,270 --> 01:25:49,790
I'll try talking to the banshee.

1234
01:25:50,440 --> 01:25:51,550
Leave this on me.

1235
01:25:51,630 --> 01:25:52,590
Smash it on you?

1236
01:25:59,100 --> 01:26:01,140
Tie him up. This deaf man

1237
01:26:03,620 --> 01:26:05,540
Let me talk to the banshee.

1238
01:26:05,610 --> 01:26:08,380
She's also someone's sister,
someone's daughter.

1239
01:26:08,460 --> 01:26:10,100
My dear banshee...

1240
01:26:10,380 --> 01:26:13,900
My dear banshee...show
some ghost-anity.

1241
01:26:13,970 --> 01:26:15,050
Ghost-anity?

1242
01:26:15,250 --> 01:26:17,490
Just like humans have humanity.

1243
01:26:17,530 --> 01:26:19,360
Ghosts have ghost-anity.
Trying to fix this

1244
01:26:19,720 --> 01:26:22,490
Look, daughter, I just...
- Right-right...

1245
01:26:22,610 --> 01:26:24,010
left...left. Yeah...
- right...right...

1246
01:26:24,090 --> 01:26:25,930
left...left... - Right, right...

1247
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:30,920
daughter...
- Right-left...right...left...

1248
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:33,750
daughter...
- Right-left...right...left...

1249
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:35,720
daughter...
- Right-left...right...left...

1250
01:26:35,790 --> 01:26:40,230
"Train...train..." Railway train
Railway train goes round and round

1251
01:26:42,920 --> 01:26:44,150
Do I look like a Jiant bell...

1252
01:26:44,350 --> 01:26:46,420
Or a table-fan, or a viper? Who am I?

1253
01:26:46,510 --> 01:26:48,430
From there to here and here to there.

1254
01:26:52,180 --> 01:26:56,620
Gopu...what are you doing
in the middle of the road, Gopu?

1255
01:26:56,860 --> 01:26:58,860
Waiting for Rohit Shetty
to arrive with his cars?

1256
01:26:58,940 --> 01:27:00,660
There's a ghost inside.
- What?

1257
01:27:00,740 --> 01:27:03,010
A female ghost.
- Daam those three..

1258
01:27:03,100 --> 01:27:04,050
What?

1259
01:27:04,130 --> 01:27:06,570
I said those three are
up to their old tricks again.

1260
01:27:06,650 --> 01:27:08,480
Madhav, Lucky, Laxman...

1261
01:27:08,570 --> 01:27:12,520
...it's their job to create
fake ghosts like Ram Gopal Verma.

1262
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:14,960
There's a real ghost inside.
- Gopu,...

1263
01:27:15,290 --> 01:27:16,400
I know you don't stay up at night...

1264
01:27:16,490 --> 01:27:21,400
...but those three made
you look like an owl. F O O L. owl

1265
01:27:21,880 --> 01:27:25,600
the girl who died 17 days ago. It's her ghost
- Gopal, son...

1266
01:27:25,630 --> 01:27:28,420
...I'll go inside and
clear your misconception.

1267
01:27:28,830 --> 01:27:30,790
My buddies (Vikrams
kids- Vikram ke Bhatto)

1268
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:32,230
Please leave

1269
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:33,670
Look, Babli's here.

1270
01:27:34,510 --> 01:27:36,310
Babli bhai...

1271
01:27:39,310 --> 01:27:41,740
Babli sir...you shouldn't
have come here.

1272
01:27:41,820 --> 01:27:42,980
Quiet!

1273
01:27:43,530 --> 01:27:45,580
My ugly duckling (my
Jimmy Sherrgill of mice)

1274
01:27:45,650 --> 01:27:49,500
Do you also believe there's a ghost here?
- Of course...

1275
01:27:49,660 --> 01:27:51,060
There is...there
is...she's right there.

1276
01:27:52,020 --> 01:27:53,850
Is this Planning, Madhav?

1277
01:27:54,290 --> 01:27:55,370
Planning for what?

1278
01:27:55,610 --> 01:28:00,320
Madhav, if there's
a ghost here then tell her...

1279
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:04,010
...that Babli's here
in a guest appearance.

1280
01:28:04,730 --> 01:28:07,570
She must take good care of the guest.

1281
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:14,390
Where are you my
banshee's Bipasha Basu?

1282
01:28:14,630 --> 01:28:16,950
I think even he can't
see the banshee like me.

1283
01:28:17,030 --> 01:28:22,040
listen carefully, if you're the
caretaker than I am the Undertaker.

1284
01:28:22,200 --> 01:28:25,990
Babli sir, please leave now!
- Nonsense, why tomorrow?

1285
01:28:26,070 --> 01:28:27,620
I'll have tea today.

1286
01:28:28,910 --> 01:28:30,860
So far, so good.

1287
01:28:30,940 --> 01:28:34,540
Call that banshee. Hello, ABCD.

1288
01:28:34,740 --> 01:28:36,620
A for Aatma (spirit),
B for Bhootni (banshee)...

1289
01:28:36,690 --> 01:28:38,700
...C for Chudail (witch),
D for Daayan (enchantress).

1290
01:28:38,780 --> 01:28:42,660
Come on baby banshee, show your moves.
Oh shit!

1291
01:28:45,700 --> 01:28:57,290
Mummy! mummy! Am I going up or
is the ceiling coming down? Save me!

1292
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:04,310
Vasooli bhai.
- Gopal, what are you doing like this outside?

1293
01:29:04,400 --> 01:29:06,270
Vasooli bhai, there's a ghost inside.
- What?

1294
01:29:07,110 --> 01:29:09,350
I think my boys have done their job.

1295
01:29:09,670 --> 01:29:11,120
This is a very bad news, Gopal.

1296
01:29:11,440 --> 01:29:12,910
Now I must go inside
and save everyone.

1297
01:29:12,990 --> 01:29:15,830
But that can be...
- I know it's a life taking situation, but...

1298
01:29:15,950 --> 01:29:18,830
What happened?
- Gopal, someone's pulling me inside.

1299
01:29:18,910 --> 01:29:21,670
Now that's called scaring.
Gopal, save me.

1300
01:29:21,740 --> 01:29:23,900
That's Vasooli's punch. Gopal,...
- Vasooli bhai.

1301
01:29:23,980 --> 01:29:25,650
....please tell everyone
how Vasooli died.

1302
01:29:25,860 --> 01:29:30,340
Someone is infamous...

1303
01:29:33,220 --> 01:29:35,890
Madhav.
- Vasooli bhai, ghost.

1304
01:29:35,970 --> 01:29:37,330
Ghost? (camel)
- Ghost?(camel)

1305
01:29:37,970 --> 01:29:40,760
Okay.. Alright.

1306
01:29:41,370 --> 01:29:43,200
I know there's a ghost here.

1307
01:29:43,290 --> 01:29:45,330
Vasooli bhai, he's telling the truth.

1308
01:29:45,410 --> 01:29:48,480
There is a ghost.
look, she is standing there.

1309
01:29:49,290 --> 01:29:50,800
Where?

1310
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:53,510
There.
- Vasooli please, understand.

1311
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:57,160
Madhav, you're so engrossed
in trying to scare them...

1312
01:29:57,200 --> 01:29:59,310
...that you started believing
there's a ghost here.

1313
01:29:59,670 --> 01:30:01,310
You guys don't even know
how to scare someone.

1314
01:30:01,390 --> 01:30:02,590
Now Learn from me.

1315
01:30:02,680 --> 01:30:04,840
I just scared Gopal outside.

1316
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:08,550
I said someone is pulling
my arm... pulling my arm...

1317
01:30:15,180 --> 01:30:16,530
Madhav.

1318
01:30:22,220 --> 01:30:24,930
Babli... This place is haunted.

1319
01:30:25,060 --> 01:30:27,810
My flying Jatt...I know.

1320
01:30:28,490 --> 01:30:29,810
This place is haunted.
This place is haunted.

1321
01:30:29,890 --> 01:30:32,520
B O O T Y... (bhoot) Ghost.

1322
01:30:35,330 --> 01:30:36,650
Anna.

1323
01:30:38,650 --> 01:30:39,760
What happened?

1324
01:30:40,200 --> 01:30:41,600
Damini is a ghost.

1325
01:30:44,590 --> 01:30:46,910
Come with me.
- No no, I won't.

1326
01:30:46,990 --> 01:30:48,280
Whoever goes inside doesn't come back.

1327
01:30:48,350 --> 01:30:50,950
Don't worry Gopal, I am here.
- But Anna

1328
01:30:51,390 --> 01:30:53,280
You trust me, don't you? Come on.

1329
01:30:53,560 --> 01:30:54,670
No, Anna.
- Come on.

1330
01:30:54,720 --> 01:30:56,070
Anna.
- Come on.

1331
01:30:57,510 --> 01:30:59,190
No, Anna.
- Come, Gopal.

1332
01:30:59,700 --> 01:31:01,100
Come on.

1333
01:31:02,430 --> 01:31:04,500
Gopal, I am right here. Let's go.

1334
01:31:06,820 --> 01:31:10,550
Ghost...she's a ghost.

1335
01:31:11,060 --> 01:31:13,220
Gopal, come with me.

1336
01:31:14,420 --> 01:31:15,530
Run away...

1337
01:31:15,620 --> 01:31:19,050
She's a ghost too.
- She's a ghost.

1338
01:31:19,130 --> 01:31:20,320
Shut up.

1339
01:31:20,610 --> 01:31:22,850
I'll beat you all you into ghosts.
-What?

1340
01:31:22,920 --> 01:31:24,520
Come out all of you... Come on.

1341
01:31:32,300 --> 01:31:35,260
'They were all in shock...
They had thousands of questions.'

1342
01:31:36,940 --> 01:31:37,820
They all were sacred...

1343
01:31:38,890 --> 01:31:45,860
'I explained everyone
that she was just a pure soul...'

1344
01:31:46,770 --> 01:31:52,530
They were all stunned when
I told them who the spirit was.

1345
01:31:52,640 --> 01:31:54,200
'I told the spirits real name.'

1346
01:31:56,680 --> 01:31:58,040
Khushi.

1347
01:32:04,880 --> 01:32:06,040
Khushi.

1348
01:32:07,920 --> 01:32:09,910
Didn't you all recognize her?

1349
01:32:11,350 --> 01:32:12,900
She's your Kushi...

1350
01:32:14,060 --> 01:32:16,350
...who you had picked
up from the streets.

1351
01:32:19,990 --> 01:32:21,590
Saved her life.

1352
01:32:22,180 --> 01:32:24,740
You must be wondering
how can she be with us...

1353
01:32:24,820 --> 01:32:26,980
...even though she's dead.

1354
01:32:28,540 --> 01:32:30,940
This is not possible.
How can we believe this?

1355
01:32:33,380 --> 01:32:39,610
When it's God's will, there
is no logic in things, only magic.

1356
01:32:40,930 --> 01:32:42,640
Meaning Khushi?
- Our Khushi.

1357
01:32:43,450 --> 01:32:46,720
Same Khushi.
- She's our Khushi.

1358
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:48,150
She's our Khushi.

1359
01:32:48,240 --> 01:32:49,160
Khushi.

1360
01:32:50,190 --> 01:32:53,180
Madhav, we used to rock her in our arms.
- Yeah...yeah

1361
01:32:55,700 --> 01:32:57,580
Ohh... Gopu...

1362
01:32:58,330 --> 01:33:01,890
Gopu, your to-be wife turned
out to be your has been daughter.

1363
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:07,890
"The apple of Jamnadas' eye..."
- Quiet!

1364
01:33:07,970 --> 01:33:10,040
Is he sleeping?
- Hold on. Leave all this

1365
01:33:10,570 --> 01:33:14,080
After all these years,
Our Khushi... And like this?

1366
01:33:14,410 --> 01:33:16,520
How? I don't understand any of it.

1367
01:33:16,720 --> 01:33:18,960
Will someone tell me whether
she's on the left or right?

1368
01:33:19,040 --> 01:33:20,000
...where is she?

1369
01:33:20,070 --> 01:33:22,510
She's like Anil Kapoor from Mr.
India for us.

1370
01:33:22,590 --> 01:33:23,560
Yes.

1371
01:33:25,150 --> 01:33:27,470
But how could our Khushi die?

1372
01:33:27,640 --> 01:33:28,800
What stupidity is this!

1373
01:33:28,870 --> 01:33:30,750
Anna, please explain.
We don't understand anything.

1374
01:33:30,830 --> 01:33:31,750
Yes.

1375
01:33:37,740 --> 01:33:39,220
After you guys left.

1376
01:33:39,290 --> 01:33:41,270
The Colonel and his wife adopted me.

1377
01:33:41,830 --> 01:33:44,620
Father and Jamnadas
were close friends.

1378
01:33:45,380 --> 01:33:47,260
Father also had a tea-estate in Ooty.

1379
01:33:47,450 --> 01:33:51,170
He wanted me to take over
the tea-estate business in future.

1380
01:33:52,690 --> 01:33:54,930
Since childhood I was interested
in art and craft.

1381
01:33:55,490 --> 01:33:57,010
Whether it was at
home or in the orphanage...

1382
01:33:57,170 --> 01:34:00,170
...I would start painting
wherever I got a chance.

1383
01:34:13,630 --> 01:34:15,600
I knew Anna since then.

1384
01:34:15,960 --> 01:34:18,310
She was like an elder sister,
a mentor to me.

1385
01:34:18,590 --> 01:34:20,550
I grew up...things were going normal.

1386
01:34:21,110 --> 01:34:23,110
But then,
one day mother passed away...

1387
01:34:23,510 --> 01:34:25,150
...and father lost his vision.

1388
01:34:31,180 --> 01:34:35,140
I took on the responsibility
of my father and the tea-estate.

1389
01:34:36,100 --> 01:34:38,610
Like they say,
time is the greatest healer.

1390
01:34:38,940 --> 01:34:41,890
Slowly things got better.
Life was back to normal.

1391
01:34:42,090 --> 01:34:43,210
Khushi.

1392
01:34:47,370 --> 01:34:51,730
Khushi. Did you recognize him?
- Oh my, God. Nikhil.

1393
01:34:51,800 --> 01:34:53,160
After 7 whole years.

1394
01:34:53,240 --> 01:34:54,970
When did you arrive?
And why didn't you inform?

1395
01:34:55,360 --> 01:34:57,720
I met your father in the morning.

1396
01:34:58,440 --> 01:34:59,520
But you weren't there.

1397
01:34:59,560 --> 01:35:01,720
Yes, I was out for
some tea estate work

1398
01:35:01,790 --> 01:35:05,160
So finally, Dubai kicked you out.

1399
01:35:05,230 --> 01:35:08,350
No, no, he's got a huge
construction business in Dubai.

1400
01:35:08,680 --> 01:35:13,030
And now, he'll start a construction
business in Ooty along with Vasu Reddy.

1401
01:35:13,510 --> 01:35:15,590
And Khushi, he has big plans...

1402
01:35:15,670 --> 01:35:17,270
...for the children of our orphanage.

1403
01:35:17,420 --> 01:35:19,060
I've no one in this world.

1404
01:35:20,570 --> 01:35:22,110
I never got along with my brother.

1405
01:35:23,550 --> 01:35:25,900
He's all that I got now.
My nephew, Nikhil.

1406
01:35:26,180 --> 01:35:27,740
And, this is why I've decided...

1407
01:35:28,620 --> 01:35:30,060
...I'll give him the orphanage.

1408
01:35:30,410 --> 01:35:33,490
'It didn't seem like Nikhil
and I were meeting after many years.'

1409
01:35:33,850 --> 01:35:36,250
'I could feel a special
connection between us.'

1410
01:35:36,880 --> 01:35:39,770
'We started spending
a lot of time together.'

1411
01:35:40,730 --> 01:35:44,240
"coming and going..."

1412
01:35:44,480 --> 01:35:46,720
"laughing and singing..."

1413
01:35:48,120 --> 01:35:53,960
"...I imagined this
in my mind many times."

1414
01:35:55,840 --> 01:35:58,320
"The first glimpse..."

1415
01:35:59,550 --> 01:36:02,110
"The slow effect..."

1416
01:36:03,350 --> 01:36:08,900
"Why does it make the heart restless?"

1417
01:36:10,690 --> 01:36:13,540
"Stopping and walking."

1418
01:36:14,540 --> 01:36:17,300
"Walking and stopping."

1419
01:36:18,610 --> 01:36:24,090
"no idea who you're waiting for."

1420
01:36:25,970 --> 01:36:32,610
"Could I be...the one you believe."

1421
01:36:33,440 --> 01:36:39,440
"why do I feel like
that all the time?"

1422
01:37:18,520 --> 01:37:19,970
You guys played a big game with me.

1423
01:37:20,060 --> 01:37:21,370
Don't get so hyper.

1424
01:37:21,450 --> 01:37:23,250
Let us explain.
- What will you explain?

1425
01:37:24,850 --> 01:37:26,160
Explain me what?

1426
01:37:26,920 --> 01:37:29,640
You two only want to
build your dream project.

1427
01:37:30,240 --> 01:37:31,710
I went over to your
architect's office...

1428
01:37:31,800 --> 01:37:33,590
...and saw the blueprints and model!

1429
01:37:34,680 --> 01:37:38,160
You've nothing to do with
the future of my children.

1430
01:37:38,230 --> 01:37:41,110
No, uncle.
- You usurped my land by wrong means.

1431
01:37:41,440 --> 01:37:44,070
I will change my will
and give it to Pappi instead.

1432
01:37:44,590 --> 01:37:47,430
Uncle, please don't
let my efforts go to waste.

1433
01:37:47,500 --> 01:37:49,900
What effort?
- I worked really hard, uncle...

1434
01:37:50,270 --> 01:37:54,670
I lied...scammed...convinced
you to give me your land...

1435
01:37:54,740 --> 01:37:56,990
...spent so much time
with those orphans.

1436
01:37:57,100 --> 01:38:00,180
Even convinced Khushi
to marry me for that bungalow.

1437
01:38:01,140 --> 01:38:02,500
Asked Baba for Dubai..

1438
01:38:02,690 --> 01:38:05,610
I worked really hard
for my Adventure Land Project.

1439
01:38:11,290 --> 01:38:12,810
If you change the will, old man...

1440
01:38:13,290 --> 01:38:15,160
...I'll change your expiry date.

1441
01:38:15,730 --> 01:38:17,240
It's not your fault.

1442
01:38:17,610 --> 01:38:19,720
your blood is only filthy.

1443
01:38:20,840 --> 01:38:22,590
Your father cheated me for money.

1444
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:24,270
And you cheated me for the land.

1445
01:38:24,360 --> 01:38:26,320
You're a scoundrel
son of a scoundrel father!

1446
01:38:29,840 --> 01:38:30,950
No...

1447
01:38:31,080 --> 01:38:33,390
Mr. Jamnadas. Mr. Jamnadas.

1448
01:38:33,990 --> 01:38:36,740
He's dead. You killed him.

1449
01:38:51,420 --> 01:38:52,620
Khushi.

1450
01:38:54,370 --> 01:38:55,650
Hello?

1451
01:38:56,130 --> 01:38:57,530
You should've called.

1452
01:38:58,130 --> 01:39:00,380
Oh, you got the wedding cards.

1453
01:39:01,170 --> 01:39:03,170
You did the right thing...you
shouldn't have called.

1454
01:39:03,210 --> 01:39:04,610
This had to be a surprise.

1455
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:08,400
Khushi weds Nikhil.
- I'll tell the Police everything.

1456
01:39:13,480 --> 01:39:14,920
Don't be so unreasonable, Khushi.

1457
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,720
I won't let those orphanage
kids loose their home.

1458
01:39:18,160 --> 01:39:19,760
Just try and understand.
- I will tell the Police...

1459
01:39:19,840 --> 01:39:22,480
This is unbelievable...this
is too much.

1460
01:39:23,990 --> 01:39:25,310
What did I ask for?

1461
01:39:26,390 --> 01:39:29,270
A poor guy is trying
to fulfill his only dream.

1462
01:39:29,340 --> 01:39:30,390
But, no...

1463
01:39:30,580 --> 01:39:32,380
Everyone wants to
meddle in his business.

1464
01:39:33,300 --> 01:39:34,790
Think practically, Khushi.

1465
01:39:35,070 --> 01:39:36,870
This old man had already
lived beyond his age.

1466
01:39:37,780 --> 01:39:39,900
You've your entire
life in front of you.

1467
01:39:40,260 --> 01:39:43,220
There's just a murderer
in front of me.

1468
01:39:45,810 --> 01:39:47,410
Nikhil, what are you doing?

1469
01:40:18,590 --> 01:40:22,190
Vasu, take his body to the orphanage.

1470
01:40:22,740 --> 01:40:25,500
Throw it off the roof and
prove that it was an accident.

1471
01:40:27,380 --> 01:40:30,900
And you, my gorgeous.
Let's go for a drive.

1472
01:40:52,080 --> 01:40:54,840
What? She left three hours back.

1473
01:40:55,950 --> 01:40:57,150
Okay, alright Nikhil.

1474
01:40:57,240 --> 01:40:59,480
I'll call you once she arrives.

1475
01:40:59,880 --> 01:41:01,120
Okay.

1476
01:41:01,880 --> 01:41:03,080
What did he say?

1477
01:41:03,150 --> 01:41:05,270
Nikhil said she left long back.

1478
01:41:05,470 --> 01:41:06,830
Anna sister...

1479
01:41:07,150 --> 01:41:10,150
Mr. Jamnadas fell off the roof.

1480
01:41:10,430 --> 01:41:11,740
What?

1481
01:41:17,590 --> 01:41:19,070
What's going on, Anna?

1482
01:41:19,940 --> 01:41:21,980
There's no trace of Khushi either.

1483
01:41:27,610 --> 01:41:29,410
What time did she leave
home in the evening?

1484
01:41:29,490 --> 01:41:30,960
At around 6 pm.

1485
01:41:31,370 --> 01:41:34,730
I am worried, Dande.
- Don't worry, Mr. Chouhan.

1486
01:41:35,050 --> 01:41:36,970
We'll do whatever we can.

1487
01:43:01,850 --> 01:43:11,150
The next day Nikhil left for Dubai, I thought
of stopping him but what would I say to him?

1488
01:43:12,690 --> 01:43:15,410
I even thought of telling
the Police everything.

1489
01:43:16,010 --> 01:43:18,170
But how would I make them believe me?

1490
01:43:18,650 --> 01:43:20,130
I was thinking about all that...

1491
01:43:20,850 --> 01:43:23,010
...when I met you guys at Mr.
Jamnadas' memorial service.

1492
01:43:23,680 --> 01:43:25,640
God answered my questions.

1493
01:43:26,200 --> 01:43:28,320
Only you five can see Khushi.

1494
01:43:28,910 --> 01:43:30,040
Why?

1495
01:43:30,600 --> 01:43:31,720
It's a sign.

1496
01:43:32,120 --> 01:43:33,240
Sign from God.

1497
01:43:33,720 --> 01:43:36,550
He wants all five
of you to help Khushi.

1498
01:43:37,790 --> 01:43:40,030
And for that,
I had to get all of you here.

1499
01:43:40,270 --> 01:43:41,420
You guys got here...

1500
01:43:41,750 --> 01:43:45,620
...but we were waiting
for you to unite...

1501
01:43:45,700 --> 01:43:47,270
...so that we can tell you everything.

1502
01:43:48,030 --> 01:43:50,350
And then you can
get justice for Khushi.

1503
01:43:51,220 --> 01:43:53,980
And save the kids of the orphanage...

1504
01:43:54,780 --> 01:43:57,690
...where you guys
spent your childhood.

1505
01:44:12,040 --> 01:44:13,440
Madam.

1506
01:44:27,650 --> 01:44:29,850
Oh brother!
What was all that drama inside?

1507
01:44:29,940 --> 01:44:32,210
Yes... They turned out to
be like Thakur from 'Sholay'.

1508
01:44:32,300 --> 01:44:34,060
They were planning
to make a gang all along.

1509
01:44:34,570 --> 01:44:36,010
At least Thakur was
still alive in that.

1510
01:44:36,490 --> 01:44:38,450
Do we have to be like
Jai and Veeru for the dead?

1511
01:44:38,820 --> 01:44:41,570
Till now we heard
'Wanted dead or alive'.

1512
01:44:41,900 --> 01:44:44,450
Now, we've to catch
a living for the dead.

1513
01:44:44,540 --> 01:44:45,260
What nonsense?

1514
01:44:47,650 --> 01:44:49,970
But I understood everything, Lucky.
- What?

1515
01:44:50,370 --> 01:44:53,490
We should not meddle in this
whole "Justice for Khushi issues"

1516
01:44:53,570 --> 01:44:54,850
Yes...
- But why?

1517
01:44:54,930 --> 01:44:56,370
Because she's born unlucky.

1518
01:44:56,570 --> 01:44:58,160
Look...when she was born,
her parents passed away.

1519
01:44:58,530 --> 01:45:00,250
When she came to the orphanage,
we all parted ways.

1520
01:45:00,560 --> 01:45:02,090
The colonel and his
wife adopted her...

1521
01:45:02,330 --> 01:45:04,210
...but the mother died
and the father lost his eyes.

1522
01:45:04,530 --> 01:45:05,650
Eye for an Aai (mother)!

1523
01:45:06,040 --> 01:45:07,370
One poor guy fell in love...

1524
01:45:07,440 --> 01:45:10,120
... he had to commit two
murders and run away to Dubai.

1525
01:45:10,320 --> 01:45:11,890
Look, bro, helping her is like...

1526
01:45:11,960 --> 01:45:12,760
Stepping on an axe...

1527
01:45:12,850 --> 01:45:13,600
Black money with tax...

1528
01:45:13,680 --> 01:45:15,320
...and in the interval,
comes...climax.

1529
01:45:15,800 --> 01:45:16,690
He is right.

1530
01:45:16,840 --> 01:45:18,240
What nonsense.

1531
01:45:18,720 --> 01:45:19,840
I think...

1532
01:45:22,160 --> 01:45:24,880
None of your antics, Pappi.
There is enough confusion already!

1533
01:45:26,200 --> 01:45:28,480
Say something, Gopu.
You haven't said a thing.

1534
01:45:29,760 --> 01:45:31,080
Poor guy what will he say.

1535
01:45:31,600 --> 01:45:32,840
His to-be wife turned
Into his daughter.

1536
01:45:33,190 --> 01:45:34,440
then, from daughter into a banshee.

1537
01:45:34,550 --> 01:45:36,750
And now, for that banshee,
we fight against humans?

1538
01:45:37,670 --> 01:45:41,640
Look Gopu, it was fine as long
as it was about evicting the house.

1539
01:45:41,950 --> 01:45:45,550
Now we shouldn't get into
all this ghost- justice - mess.

1540
01:45:46,350 --> 01:45:48,710
And that Nikhil... you heard na he's
a bloody murderer.

1541
01:45:48,790 --> 01:45:49,870
Yes, Gopu.

1542
01:45:50,230 --> 01:45:52,470
You know what,
I think we should run away.

1543
01:45:52,950 --> 01:45:54,390
There can't be better...
- Shut up, Madhav.

1544
01:45:54,910 --> 01:45:56,220
What's wrong with all of you?

1545
01:45:57,150 --> 01:45:58,590
Didn't you hear what Anna said?

1546
01:46:00,150 --> 01:46:01,980
Those guys killed Khushi.

1547
01:46:02,990 --> 01:46:06,500
Same Khushi...who we
all loved so dearly.

1548
01:46:07,390 --> 01:46:10,620
And Mr. Jamnadas,
if it wasn't for him...

1549
01:46:10,860 --> 01:46:12,830
...we would be lying
on some road side.

1550
01:46:14,820 --> 01:46:16,620
How can we watch these
children lose the orphanage...

1551
01:46:18,380 --> 01:46:22,100
...the same place where we grew up.

1552
01:46:23,540 --> 01:46:24,540
No.

1553
01:46:26,020 --> 01:46:27,980
Khushi gave her life for those kids.

1554
01:46:29,060 --> 01:46:30,380
For those kids.

1555
01:46:31,300 --> 01:46:36,380
And, I'll do anything I
can to get justice for Khushi.

1556
01:46:37,210 --> 01:46:40,530
Whether you guys help me...or not.

1557
01:46:41,970 --> 01:46:43,730
Gopu... listen...
- Gopu. Gopu

1558
01:46:44,090 --> 01:46:49,780
Listen, I need to get some of Khushi's
stuff removed from the closet.

1559
01:46:50,020 --> 01:46:51,970
Can you please give me a hand?

1560
01:47:13,600 --> 01:47:15,640
Be careful. What did you drop?

1561
01:47:15,880 --> 01:47:17,200
It's a diary, Baba.

1562
01:47:17,720 --> 01:47:20,440
Something's written in Arabic.

1563
01:47:22,480 --> 01:47:25,280
You're holding it upside down.
- Sorry.

1564
01:47:25,480 --> 01:47:28,400
Must be Khushi's.
She would write in it daily.

1565
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:30,960
Sometimes she would
read it out for me.

1566
01:47:36,230 --> 01:47:37,670
You're Gopal, aren't you?

1567
01:47:38,590 --> 01:47:40,750
The guy who's been forcefully
staying in that bungalow.

1568
01:47:40,920 --> 01:47:42,560
Take your brother and leave.

1569
01:47:42,880 --> 01:47:47,030
Or else, along with you two
will throw the old blind man out.

1570
01:47:47,230 --> 01:47:50,030
You don't know Nikhil
and Vasu Reddy yet.

1571
01:47:50,720 --> 01:47:53,150
For land, they can take lives!

1572
01:47:56,990 --> 01:47:58,750
Who are you? The local hero?

1573
01:47:58,990 --> 01:48:01,190
Robin Hood? Messiah?

1574
01:48:04,670 --> 01:48:05,910
I am a crack.

1575
01:48:07,220 --> 01:48:09,750
"In the orphanage, I
never felt like I am an orphan."

1576
01:48:10,060 --> 01:48:14,270
"Gopal would break fingers,
but he always held on to mine."

1577
01:48:23,420 --> 01:48:25,700
"the first Laxman
would cry along with me."

1578
01:48:25,980 --> 01:48:29,860
"And the second Laxman would
make me laugh Whenever I cried."

1579
01:48:37,540 --> 01:48:39,700
"Whenever Lucky would
get any money..."

1580
01:48:39,780 --> 01:48:44,980
"...he would first get clothes,
toys, and gifts for me."

1581
01:48:52,860 --> 01:48:57,090
"And, a day never went by
when Madhav didn't tie my hair."

1582
01:48:57,170 --> 01:48:58,930
"Whenever I asked
him why he did it..."

1583
01:48:59,010 --> 01:49:01,970
"...he would say today
is 'Baal-Diwas' (Hair Day)."

1584
01:49:13,730 --> 01:49:14,930
"After mother passed away..."

1585
01:49:14,970 --> 01:49:17,400
"...I thought I will never
be able to handle myself again."

1586
01:49:17,480 --> 01:49:19,880
"But sister Anna
supported me a lot..."

1587
01:49:20,160 --> 01:49:25,010
"...and gave me so much love,
that frankly I don't miss my mother at all."

1588
01:49:38,680 --> 01:49:43,000
"Today, I met Nikhil. I felt
an instant connection between us."

1589
01:49:43,080 --> 01:49:45,070
"He's really nice."

1590
01:49:53,590 --> 01:49:56,870
"Father agreed... My wedding's
been fixed with Nikhil."

1591
01:49:57,190 --> 01:49:59,070
"All my dreams will finally come true.

1592
01:49:59,110 --> 01:50:00,950
Even I will have a family of my own."

1593
01:50:09,030 --> 01:50:12,310
"Those five gave me the correct name.
Khushi (happiness)!"

1594
01:50:12,510 --> 01:50:17,550
"They knew that I was destined
for only happiness, all along."

1595
01:50:42,140 --> 01:50:44,850
Gopu...
- Stop it, Gopal.

1596
01:50:45,140 --> 01:50:47,580
Beating them up is not the solution.

1597
01:50:47,780 --> 01:50:49,020
This orphanage belongs to Nikhil now.

1598
01:50:49,090 --> 01:50:50,850
So we must get him here.

1599
01:50:51,450 --> 01:50:53,210
Only then can we take
this place back from him.

1600
01:50:54,210 --> 01:50:56,570
Gopu, Anna is right.

1601
01:50:58,050 --> 01:50:59,450
Let them go.

1602
01:51:12,640 --> 01:51:16,760
Dande sir ...get used to it.
We already have.

1603
01:51:16,890 --> 01:51:19,880
Dande sir, we found out that
Nikhil's coming here from Dubai.

1604
01:51:20,250 --> 01:51:23,240
I suggest that you should
arrest that Nikhil and Vasu Reddy.

1605
01:51:23,330 --> 01:51:25,040
How can I arrest them?

1606
01:51:25,560 --> 01:51:28,120
We have no evidence to prove
that they committed these murders.

1607
01:51:28,360 --> 01:51:30,360
But, if Vasu Reddy
confesses to these crimes...

1608
01:51:30,440 --> 01:51:32,240
...then we can register a case
on the basis of his statement...

1609
01:51:32,320 --> 01:51:35,280
...and issue an arrest warrant
against Nikhil. That can be done.

1610
01:51:35,480 --> 01:51:37,400
Arresting Nikhil is too far-fetched.

1611
01:51:37,480 --> 01:51:40,560
We must first think of a
way to make Vasu confess.

1612
01:51:41,440 --> 01:51:42,960
What to do, what not to do.

1613
01:51:43,040 --> 01:51:45,480
Do what do we do...Scooby Doo.

1614
01:51:45,550 --> 01:51:47,040
I was saying...

1615
01:51:50,550 --> 01:51:52,360
Katappa uncle...

1616
01:51:53,190 --> 01:51:57,880
As long as you're with me,
there is no one alive who can kill me.

1617
01:51:59,950 --> 01:52:01,440
Mother Sivagami!

1618
01:52:02,710 --> 01:52:04,190
Bhallal deva!

1619
01:52:04,630 --> 01:52:07,790
When someone raises
his hand on a woman...

1620
01:52:08,030 --> 01:52:10,950
...his only punishment can be death!
- Pappi.

1621
01:52:11,030 --> 01:52:11,630
Where's my tea?

1622
01:52:11,700 --> 01:52:12,710
There it is.
- Stop it guys!

1623
01:52:12,790 --> 01:52:13,670
I have an idea.

1624
01:52:13,750 --> 01:52:16,830
Just like Khushi possessed
our bodies and scared us...

1625
01:52:16,910 --> 01:52:20,910
...similarly we can take Khushi's
help to scare Vasu Reddy, isn't it?

1626
01:52:20,980 --> 01:52:22,070
But how?

1627
01:52:22,110 --> 01:52:23,940
Madhav, you always said...

1628
01:52:24,030 --> 01:52:25,020
Where there are humans, there's fear.

1629
01:52:25,100 --> 01:52:26,500
Where there's fear,
there's blind faith.

1630
01:52:26,700 --> 01:52:29,380
You guys scared soo many
people without any ghosts.

1631
01:52:29,580 --> 01:52:32,260
And now you guys have
a live and legit ghost.

1632
01:52:32,740 --> 01:52:34,580
Live ghost?
- Yes, ghost.

1633
01:52:34,660 --> 01:52:36,260
G S T...Ghost.

1634
01:52:36,380 --> 01:52:38,420
That's a fantastic idea, but...

1635
01:52:38,500 --> 01:52:41,260
...how will we make him believe
that there really is a ghost?

1636
01:52:41,740 --> 01:52:43,540
We all five are already in his radar.

1637
01:52:45,860 --> 01:52:48,780
Quiet...stop abusing.
There are ladies in the room.

1638
01:52:49,020 --> 01:52:50,500
He's not abusing.
- Then?

1639
01:52:50,570 --> 01:52:52,860
He's saying only
one man can do this job.

1640
01:52:53,130 --> 01:52:54,610
Pandu!

1641
01:52:54,940 --> 01:52:56,620
Pandu!
- Pandu!

1642
01:52:56,690 --> 01:52:58,650
Pandu!
- Pandu!

1643
01:52:58,730 --> 01:53:00,090
Hey...

1644
01:53:03,490 --> 01:53:05,930
What's all this 'Pandu-Pandu' about?

1645
01:53:07,410 --> 01:53:09,410
I came here thinking
I'll get some rest.

1646
01:53:09,610 --> 01:53:12,610
But blah-blah-blah...
- Nana Patekar.

1647
01:53:12,690 --> 01:53:13,410
In the flesh!

1648
01:53:13,490 --> 01:53:15,520
You can see Nana, but not the library.

1649
01:53:16,330 --> 01:53:20,210
Hey librarian...do you
also sell fish on the side?

1650
01:53:20,890 --> 01:53:24,050
Why are your eyes popping out?
Did you see a ghost?

1651
01:53:24,400 --> 01:53:27,240
Close your mouth... Or your
tongue will stick out too?

1652
01:53:28,840 --> 01:53:31,560
Hello...yeah, get the shot ready.

1653
01:53:32,240 --> 01:53:34,480
What?
Where am I speaking from?

1654
01:53:34,920 --> 01:53:36,210
Where does your father speak from?

1655
01:53:36,690 --> 01:53:38,120
Come on...step on it, step on it.

1656
01:53:39,760 --> 01:53:42,760
Everybody just chill. Call Pandu.

1657
01:53:54,110 --> 01:53:55,270
So there's a ghost
around here somewhere.

1658
01:53:55,350 --> 01:53:58,470
You five can see it,
but these three can't.

1659
01:54:01,830 --> 01:54:05,670
Snap out of it! Snap out of it!

1660
01:54:05,750 --> 01:54:07,110
I look like one...even
sound like one...

1661
01:54:07,190 --> 01:54:09,350
...but, I am not that stupid.

1662
01:54:09,550 --> 01:54:11,670
I don't believe in all this justice,
benshee, spirits, and salvation.

1663
01:54:11,750 --> 01:54:13,470
I just don't believe it!

1664
01:54:14,270 --> 01:54:17,630
Fine...Khushi, demonstrate.

1665
01:54:21,350 --> 01:54:22,420
Khushi.

1666
01:54:22,630 --> 01:54:23,660
Khushi.

1667
01:54:23,790 --> 01:54:24,820
What a joke.

1668
01:54:29,580 --> 01:54:31,100
Somebody is holding me.

1669
01:54:31,190 --> 01:54:35,620
Show him your moves, Khushi kiddo.
M T V Moves.

1670
01:54:43,700 --> 01:54:45,700
What's the plan to scare Vasu Reddy?

1671
01:54:46,210 --> 01:54:47,540
Come on.

1672
01:54:50,180 --> 01:54:52,740
Ae Mongoose!

1673
01:54:54,130 --> 01:54:56,290
Ae Mongoose!

1674
01:55:00,260 --> 01:55:04,690
You're a sinner... An evil soul.
- Who who are you?

1675
01:55:04,780 --> 01:55:06,370
"Double Double Toil and Trouble..."

1676
01:55:06,450 --> 01:55:08,100
"...fire burn and cauldron bubble."

1677
01:55:08,130 --> 01:55:09,780
"Your time will come soon."

1678
01:55:09,850 --> 01:55:13,090
"You're sleeping
soundly like a sleeping beauty ..."

1679
01:55:13,170 --> 01:55:16,130
"...but, soon you'll
be lying in your funeral fire."

1680
01:55:16,210 --> 01:55:17,490
Bahadur!

1681
01:55:18,490 --> 01:55:21,240
"You'll suffer like
a beheaded chicken..."

1682
01:55:21,960 --> 01:55:24,410
"...and be buried 6
feet under the ground."

1683
01:55:25,410 --> 01:55:29,400
"You'll be punished for
your deeds and your scams."

1684
01:55:29,490 --> 01:55:34,640
"That Adventure project
will never be yours again."

1685
01:55:35,360 --> 01:55:36,600
Adventure?

1686
01:55:37,920 --> 01:55:42,080
You killed a girl and an old man.

1687
01:55:42,840 --> 01:55:48,120
Their spirits will
come and take revenge.

1688
01:55:58,190 --> 01:56:01,160
Janardhan,
Bahadur, there's someone in the water.

1689
01:56:01,950 --> 01:56:03,670
There's someone in the water.
find him.

1690
01:56:03,760 --> 01:56:04,520
What happened?

1691
01:56:04,590 --> 01:56:06,590
That's baba's in the water, find him.

1692
01:56:07,270 --> 01:56:10,000
But, there's no one here, sir.
- He is...

1693
01:56:11,030 --> 01:56:13,230
look that way...look look

1694
01:56:14,190 --> 01:56:15,910
Believe me, Nikhil.

1695
01:56:16,270 --> 01:56:18,590
I don't know who or
where that Baba came from.

1696
01:56:18,990 --> 01:56:21,670
But everything he said was true.

1697
01:56:21,870 --> 01:56:24,750
Relax, Vasu.
It could be a coincidence.

1698
01:56:24,820 --> 01:56:29,140
The land, two murders...adventure
project, everything.

1699
01:56:29,380 --> 01:56:30,780
He even mentioned you.

1700
01:56:31,110 --> 01:56:33,270
He said your partner
will have to pay too.

1701
01:56:33,350 --> 01:56:37,260
I've told you Vasu, never
discuss these things over the phone.

1702
01:56:38,020 --> 01:56:39,990
Anyway, what about Gopal?

1703
01:56:40,420 --> 01:56:43,020
There's a farewell function
at the orphanage for the kids.

1704
01:56:43,350 --> 01:56:45,020
I'll deal with Gopal there.

1705
01:56:45,060 --> 01:56:48,260
But my trouble is this Baba...
- Just shut up, Vasu.

1706
01:56:48,500 --> 01:56:49,380
Just Shut up.

1707
01:56:49,460 --> 01:56:51,620
Don't mention about this to anyone.

1708
01:56:51,900 --> 01:56:53,370
I am arriving on the 30th.

1709
01:56:53,980 --> 01:56:57,500
And, I want the orphanage
empty before that.

1710
01:56:57,890 --> 01:56:58,540
That's it.

1711
01:57:03,090 --> 01:57:05,460
Brother Gopal,
I want to stay here only.

1712
01:57:05,550 --> 01:57:07,140
I don't want go to Bangalore.

1713
01:57:07,550 --> 01:57:11,190
Don't worry,
what you want that will only happen.

1714
01:57:11,500 --> 01:57:12,790
Go play.

1715
01:57:17,270 --> 01:57:18,600
Gopal, Vasu Reddy.

1716
01:57:25,730 --> 01:57:28,210
Reddy sir, that's Gopal.

1717
01:57:31,980 --> 01:57:34,570
Gopal, I'll handle this.
Stay cool, please. Come lets go

1718
01:57:34,660 --> 01:57:37,820
Yes, calm down.
- Just relax, okay.

1719
01:57:38,060 --> 01:57:39,020
Cool...cool...
- Don't get angry.

1720
01:57:39,100 --> 01:57:40,580
Madhav will handle him.
- Chill...

1721
01:57:40,660 --> 01:57:42,460
Relax.
- I am cool.

1722
01:57:42,940 --> 01:57:45,030
Stop...wait...stop.

1723
01:57:45,380 --> 01:57:48,830
Peace...non-violence...peace... P I S S

1724
01:57:49,110 --> 01:57:51,550
Reddy sir, he was your enemy...

1725
01:57:51,630 --> 01:57:53,310
...but now he's your friend.

1726
01:57:53,400 --> 01:57:57,600
What do you mean by a friend?
- Means he's ready to join our gang.

1727
01:57:58,120 --> 01:57:59,480
And, for 10 million rupees...

1728
01:57:59,560 --> 01:58:02,250
...he won't just get you the house,
but also get rid of the kids.

1729
01:58:02,290 --> 01:58:05,170
And the Colonel...out of the way.

1730
01:58:06,010 --> 01:58:08,500
Don't think too much, Vasu sir.
Let's join hands with him.

1731
01:58:08,890 --> 01:58:10,260
Gopal, come on.

1732
01:58:10,330 --> 01:58:11,780
Come, Gopu.
- He's normal now.

1733
01:58:11,860 --> 01:58:14,100
Gopu, let's go. Let's go.

1734
01:58:18,220 --> 01:58:19,430
He's just shaking your hand.

1735
01:58:20,030 --> 01:58:21,470
Shake hand. Shake hand.

1736
01:58:26,040 --> 01:58:28,480
Come, Vasu sir.
The kids are waiting for you.

1737
01:58:28,760 --> 01:58:30,120
Farewell.

1738
01:58:39,850 --> 01:58:41,130
First and foremost,...

1739
01:58:41,330 --> 01:58:47,620
...a huge round of abuses for Mr.
Vasu Reddy.

1740
01:58:47,900 --> 01:58:50,740
Ae...
- I mean applause...applause.

1741
01:58:53,100 --> 01:58:55,510
So, without wasting any time...

1742
01:58:55,590 --> 01:58:59,310
....I would like to invite Mr.
Vasu Reddy to take the mike.

1743
01:58:59,510 --> 01:59:00,790
Mr. Vasu.

1744
01:59:04,840 --> 01:59:06,080
My mother used to say...

1745
01:59:06,170 --> 01:59:07,920
Children are the image of God.

1746
01:59:08,370 --> 01:59:09,810
She was absolutely wrong.

1747
01:59:14,330 --> 01:59:17,460
In fact, Gods are an
incarnation of you kids.

1748
01:59:17,650 --> 01:59:20,180
That's why it's always said...
Children are always pure souls.

1749
01:59:21,780 --> 01:59:23,060
And today...

1750
01:59:25,540 --> 01:59:28,150
What happened, sir?
- There's current in it.

1751
01:59:28,390 --> 01:59:29,750
Let me check.

1752
01:59:37,830 --> 01:59:40,240
See...
- See what? I was just joking.

1753
01:59:41,010 --> 01:59:43,650
There's no current,
just my talent. talent

1754
01:59:43,720 --> 01:59:44,890
Come on.

1755
01:59:50,490 --> 01:59:55,100
Children, we should never
deviate from our goals.

1756
01:59:55,660 --> 01:59:58,100
Otherwise, we wont belong here...

1757
01:59:59,380 --> 02:00:01,820
...neither there.

1758
02:00:06,830 --> 02:00:09,360
You'll come across many
speed-breakers in your path.

1759
02:00:09,470 --> 02:00:10,750
But we should never stop.

1760
02:00:10,920 --> 02:00:12,600
We should overcome those...

1761
02:00:14,240 --> 02:00:16,720
What happened, sir?
- That mic punched me.

1762
02:00:16,920 --> 02:00:19,250
It's just a mic,
not Mike Tyson to punch you .

1763
02:00:19,320 --> 02:00:21,050
I don't want the mic,
get it out of here.

1764
02:00:21,130 --> 02:00:22,690
Take it out...fine, I'll get it out.

1765
02:00:30,980 --> 02:00:32,380
In order to relocate the orphanage...

1766
02:00:32,460 --> 02:00:35,140
...I met with the Education
Minister and told him,...

1767
02:00:36,310 --> 02:00:39,070
...that our new orphanage
will have only one slogan.

1768
02:00:39,670 --> 02:00:42,110
Only one motto, which is...

1769
02:00:44,830 --> 02:00:46,990
Vasu Reddy is a dog!
Vasu Reddy is a dog!

1770
02:00:47,080 --> 02:00:47,720
Repeat after me...

1771
02:00:47,800 --> 02:00:49,480
Vasu Reddy...
- Is a dog!

1772
02:00:49,520 --> 02:00:51,170
Vasu Reddy...
- Is a dog!

1773
02:00:51,240 --> 02:00:52,850
Vasu Reddy...
- Is a dog!

1774
02:00:52,930 --> 02:00:55,130
And this dog won't let
the children go anywhere.

1775
02:00:55,200 --> 02:00:58,370
No relocation.
Music. Dance...Party.

1776
02:00:58,450 --> 02:01:00,820
Play the music!
Play the music! Play the music!

1777
02:01:10,260 --> 02:01:12,550
Your daughter's been
possessed by an evil spirit!

1778
02:01:29,320 --> 02:01:31,650
...evil spirit!
- No!

1779
02:01:41,180 --> 02:01:43,380
Your daughter's been
possessed by an evil spirit!

1780
02:01:43,460 --> 02:01:44,830
No!

1781
02:01:47,430 --> 02:01:48,670
Now, do you believe us?

1782
02:01:48,750 --> 02:01:51,990
Donkey, dog, monkey...
You danced like every animal.

1783
02:01:52,390 --> 02:01:54,200
What was wrong with you, silly?

1784
02:01:54,710 --> 02:01:56,040
I am calling you silly.

1785
02:01:56,710 --> 02:01:58,680
If you didn't want the
bungalow and the orphanage...

1786
02:01:58,760 --> 02:01:59,960
...then why waste our time?

1787
02:02:00,040 --> 02:02:02,720
Mother swear I want the
bungalow and orphanage.

1788
02:02:03,250 --> 02:02:05,170
But I never danced
like this in my life.

1789
02:02:05,250 --> 02:02:06,370
I don't know what happened...

1790
02:02:07,090 --> 02:02:08,010
Hold on. Hold on.

1791
02:02:10,220 --> 02:02:12,050
Was he there too?
- Who is he?

1792
02:02:12,140 --> 02:02:13,980
He's the guy who came
to my house that day.

1793
02:02:14,180 --> 02:02:15,340
He cursed me.

1794
02:02:16,580 --> 02:02:18,300
What?
- He's saying you should've drunk it.

1795
02:02:18,390 --> 02:02:19,830
It wasn't alcohol...
I meant cursed me.

1796
02:02:20,460 --> 02:02:22,710
He was saying that I
will die because of this land.

1797
02:02:22,900 --> 02:02:23,750
My death is near.

1798
02:02:23,830 --> 02:02:26,350
Revenge... spirit...
- Hold on.

1799
02:02:26,470 --> 02:02:27,390
What happened?

1800
02:02:27,910 --> 02:02:32,000
If that's true,
then something's fishy Daya.

1801
02:02:32,600 --> 02:02:35,120
Where's Daya?
- In our heart, for you.

1802
02:02:35,280 --> 02:02:37,170
If you weren't the one dancing...

1803
02:02:37,240 --> 02:02:40,680
...and, that baba was warning
you about the land and revenge...

1804
02:02:40,770 --> 02:02:42,810
...then, there's only one logic behind it.
- What?

1805
02:02:43,330 --> 02:02:45,730
You have been possessed by a spirit.

1806
02:02:46,100 --> 02:02:47,340
What are you saying?

1807
02:02:47,700 --> 02:02:53,030
He's been possessed by ghost, witch, spirit,
demons, evil spirit, devil enchantress...

1808
02:02:53,380 --> 02:02:54,710
That's enough, stop it.

1809
02:02:54,780 --> 02:02:56,430
But it's true, these things happen.

1810
02:02:56,500 --> 02:02:58,630
Ghosts are common in land matters.

1811
02:02:58,710 --> 02:03:02,750
Remember Babli's
neighbor...Lopa Mudra!

1812
02:03:08,160 --> 02:03:09,810
What happened to Lopa Mudra?

1813
02:03:09,840 --> 02:03:12,360
She moved heaven and earth...

1814
02:03:12,450 --> 02:03:14,610
...but, she didn't give her
piece of land to the landlord.

1815
02:03:14,690 --> 02:03:18,130
So the landlord buried
her under the same piece of land...

1816
02:03:18,220 --> 02:03:19,370
...which she fought for.

1817
02:03:19,420 --> 02:03:23,500
till today Lopa Mudra's
spirit comes out of that land...

1818
02:03:23,580 --> 02:03:26,460
...in different
positions and screams...

1819
02:03:26,540 --> 02:03:27,980
"Zameen (Land)!"

1820
02:03:28,070 --> 02:03:29,510
"Zameen (Land)!"

1821
02:03:29,660 --> 02:03:31,670
"Zameen (Land)!"
- That's enough, stop it.

1822
02:03:31,750 --> 02:03:34,390
Laxman, that was a bigger problem.

1823
02:03:34,870 --> 02:03:36,000
Lopa Mudra was murdered...

1824
02:03:36,070 --> 02:03:38,070
...and, she came back for revenge.
- Right.

1825
02:03:38,310 --> 02:03:42,320
Vasu sir, did you kill someone
or got someone killed for the land?

1826
02:03:44,560 --> 02:03:46,520
I... no-no-no, not at all.

1827
02:03:46,610 --> 02:03:48,290
Then there is no problem.
Let's go.

1828
02:03:54,980 --> 02:04:01,140
No...No...No...
- What no?

1829
02:04:01,380 --> 02:04:03,020
Nothing...we just wanted
to check the time.

1830
02:04:03,870 --> 02:04:05,460
Nine minutes past nine.

1831
02:04:17,320 --> 02:04:18,880
Raghav! Raghav.

1832
02:04:18,960 --> 02:04:22,240
Raghav, fire.
Put it out. Fire extinguisher.

1833
02:04:22,320 --> 02:04:25,290
Fire. Put it out. Put it out.

1834
02:04:44,760 --> 02:04:47,970
'We had all planned for tomorrow.'

1835
02:04:47,990 --> 02:04:52,070
'But we were also afraid
that our plan might backfire.'

1836
02:05:04,050 --> 02:05:06,580
What are you guys doing here?
- Listen up, come here.

1837
02:05:06,820 --> 02:05:08,620
We've come up with some
options to kill the Colonel. - Yes.

1838
02:05:08,700 --> 02:05:10,980
The first option;
we'll hang him upside down...

1839
02:05:11,070 --> 02:05:12,220
...and loosen him loin-cloth.

1840
02:05:12,310 --> 02:05:14,860
Then, we'll make a noose
out of it and hang him.

1841
02:05:14,950 --> 02:05:15,910
Nonsense. Nonsense. - No...

1842
02:05:16,430 --> 02:05:18,760
The second option;
he was a colonel, so we'll tell him...

1843
02:05:18,830 --> 02:05:20,240
...to teach us how to fire a gun.

1844
02:05:20,310 --> 02:05:22,990
When he picks up the gun,
we'll turn it around.

1845
02:05:23,080 --> 02:05:23,680
Bang...

1846
02:05:23,750 --> 02:05:25,720
no, no, no...
- Okay, the third option.

1847
02:05:25,800 --> 02:05:30,240
We'll take him out to light a candle...
but instead take him to a petrol station.

1848
02:05:30,290 --> 02:05:33,610
"Light a match...and up he goes in flames."
- Nonsense. stupid, stupid, stupid.

1849
02:05:33,690 --> 02:05:34,970
Fourth option;

1850
02:05:37,060 --> 02:05:38,300
Electricity on.

1851
02:05:40,980 --> 02:05:42,580
Don't translate that, its absurd.

1852
02:05:42,660 --> 02:05:44,230
Next option, please.
- The fifth option;

1853
02:05:45,230 --> 02:05:46,710
...we'll call the
Colonel to your office...

1854
02:05:46,820 --> 02:05:48,830
...and strangle him to death.

1855
02:05:51,350 --> 02:05:54,750
After that,
we'll put his body in a car...

1856
02:05:54,870 --> 02:05:57,680
...and throw it down the valley.

1857
02:05:59,120 --> 02:06:01,000
No, no, that's not possible.
- That's the best idea.

1858
02:06:01,050 --> 02:06:03,010
It's already been done.
- Done?

1859
02:06:03,490 --> 02:06:06,410
I mean...you guys are out of options,
now let me think.

1860
02:06:06,650 --> 02:06:09,490
"Don't knock on the door, beloved."

1861
02:06:10,090 --> 02:06:12,580
Just come in straight. beloved

1862
02:06:12,770 --> 02:06:15,460
Vasu sir,
there's a chick in your bedroom...

1863
02:06:15,650 --> 02:06:18,860
...looking for some good time.
- I don't have a sweetheart.

1864
02:06:19,020 --> 02:06:21,340
"Don't knock on the door, beloved."

1865
02:06:25,390 --> 02:06:28,230
Just come in straight beloved

1866
02:06:28,470 --> 02:06:31,840
Vasu sir,
can't say whether you're possessed...

1867
02:06:32,040 --> 02:06:34,280
...but the animal inside
you is definitely coming out.

1868
02:06:34,360 --> 02:06:35,600
Quite.

1869
02:06:36,200 --> 02:06:38,290
"Come come..."

1870
02:06:44,650 --> 02:06:46,020
Hey...

1871
02:06:48,420 --> 02:06:50,100
"Double Double Toil and Trouble..."

1872
02:06:50,180 --> 02:06:51,940
"...fire burn and cauldron bubble."

1873
02:06:53,670 --> 02:06:57,070
"You may be sleeping soundly
like a sleeping beauty you pig..."

1874
02:06:57,140 --> 02:07:00,510
"...but, soon you'll be lying
on your funeral fire for sure."

1875
02:07:02,710 --> 02:07:03,950
He's that baba.

1876
02:07:04,040 --> 02:07:06,720
Just like there's a baby-shower
before the child's born...

1877
02:07:07,240 --> 02:07:11,560
...similarly,
this is your shower before you die.

1878
02:07:46,290 --> 02:07:52,570
Where are you going sir?
Even I want to kill you!

1879
02:08:02,420 --> 02:08:05,700
Today You're going to die, Vasu Reddy.

1880
02:08:43,270 --> 02:08:45,830
We've caught him, Vasu sir.
No need to be scared.

1881
02:08:45,910 --> 02:08:47,270
Everything he said
turned out to be true.

1882
02:08:47,360 --> 02:08:48,990
That spirit is everywhere.
She will kill me.

1883
02:08:49,080 --> 02:08:51,560
Save me. - listen If you want
to get rid of that spirit...

1884
02:08:51,630 --> 02:08:54,440
...then, we must go to sister Anna.
- Yes.

1885
02:08:54,960 --> 02:08:56,120
Why Anna?

1886
02:08:56,200 --> 02:08:58,410
Because Anna doesn't
just see and talk to ghosts...

1887
02:08:58,490 --> 02:09:00,480
...in fact, she also executes
them with her powers.

1888
02:09:01,370 --> 02:09:04,010
Let's go, let's go.
- Save me. Save me.

1889
02:09:04,090 --> 02:09:05,810
Come on, Gopu. let's go.

1890
02:09:07,970 --> 02:09:18,590
Eeem-Breem...Hocus-Pocus...
spirits-ghouls...Plasma...

1891
02:09:21,550 --> 02:09:23,470
Plasma 32 Inch.

1892
02:09:24,230 --> 02:09:25,710
What have you guys written?

1893
02:09:25,800 --> 02:09:27,560
Anna Aunty, I wrote this.

1894
02:09:27,670 --> 02:09:30,880
The spelling of ghosts and spirits.
P L A S M A...

1895
02:09:30,960 --> 02:09:32,160
Ghost and spirit.

1896
02:09:32,360 --> 02:09:35,120
Shut up, Babli.
I am already very nervous.

1897
02:09:35,290 --> 02:09:37,290
They will be here
any minute with Vasu.

1898
02:09:38,090 --> 02:09:39,530
And what do you guys think?

1899
02:09:39,890 --> 02:09:41,940
Making a circle of
lemons and chilies...

1900
02:09:42,010 --> 02:09:44,100
...and putting a voodoo doll in the
middle and all the hamming...

1901
02:09:44,380 --> 02:09:45,460
...will make Vasu believe all this?

1902
02:09:45,540 --> 02:09:46,940
Of course, he will.

1903
02:09:46,980 --> 02:09:50,390
There's only one thing everyone
believes in... Blind Faith.

1904
02:09:50,740 --> 02:09:53,620
And, we'll just scare him out
of his wits and record his confession.

1905
02:09:54,190 --> 02:09:55,510
He'll be here any minute.

1906
02:09:55,590 --> 02:09:58,040
Come, Gandhari.
let's hide behind the books.

1907
02:09:58,760 --> 02:10:00,640
Why you... this way.

1908
02:10:08,690 --> 02:10:13,410
Spirits...ghouls...and ghosts.

1909
02:10:13,890 --> 02:10:16,790
Deeds misdeeds punishment indifference

1910
02:10:16,870 --> 02:10:20,410
Eem Breem Cold Cream.

1911
02:10:24,920 --> 02:10:28,510
Spirituality attainment
pleasant morning

1912
02:10:28,590 --> 02:10:31,650
Naughty naughty naughty talks

1913
02:10:34,100 --> 02:10:36,480
Shut up, Lucky.
This is serious work.

1914
02:10:36,800 --> 02:10:38,330
Sister Anna, please continue.

1915
02:10:38,490 --> 02:10:41,030
Do something, save me, please.
- Hold on...

1916
02:10:42,320 --> 02:10:46,470
That spirit is somewhere here only.
I can feel it.

1917
02:10:49,090 --> 02:10:52,030
Hello...
I am air hostess Shabbo...

1918
02:10:52,110 --> 02:10:54,080
...welcoming you to
Hyderabad Airlines,...

1919
02:10:54,120 --> 02:10:56,420
...and let's quickly go
over the safety instructions.

1920
02:10:56,500 --> 02:10:58,950
When the air pressure reduces...

1921
02:10:59,030 --> 02:11:02,340
...the oxygen masks will fall
down from the compartment above.

1922
02:11:02,660 --> 02:11:06,810
Don't start screaming 'Snake-Snake'
when you see the oxygen masks.

1923
02:11:06,890 --> 02:11:08,980
Don't scream and yell like idiots.
Don't behave like illiterates, I say.

1924
02:11:09,060 --> 02:11:10,990
Two doors in the front,
and two at the back.

1925
02:11:11,070 --> 02:11:12,040
And, if the roof blows off...

1926
02:11:12,120 --> 02:11:13,010
...Then its gods court.

1927
02:11:13,370 --> 02:11:15,790
Hey, mister, fasten your seat-belt.
Have you come to a wedding?

1928
02:11:15,950 --> 02:11:17,640
Hey, madam,
what all are you sitting here with?

1929
02:11:17,720 --> 02:11:20,210
Put all these lemons and chillies in the
luggage compartment... Who let her in?

1930
02:11:20,420 --> 02:11:22,150
Pappi...
- Sit! Sit

1931
02:11:22,270 --> 02:11:23,840
Understand the seriousness
of the situation!

1932
02:11:23,920 --> 02:11:26,130
Quiet everyone...quiet.

1933
02:11:27,220 --> 02:11:28,630
Tell me...

1934
02:11:29,760 --> 02:11:32,780
Tell me what do you want.

1935
02:11:34,190 --> 02:11:35,720
What?

1936
02:11:36,850 --> 02:11:38,170
I see...

1937
02:11:41,480 --> 02:11:46,550
Vasu, (yes) this spirit
will leave you alone only...

1938
02:11:46,630 --> 02:11:53,480
...if you confess to each and every
crimes so that we can record everything.

1939
02:11:54,360 --> 02:11:55,370
What...

1940
02:11:55,450 --> 02:11:58,030
She means confess to your crimes...

1941
02:11:58,110 --> 02:12:01,130
...so that Anna can get rid of
the ghost in record-breaking time.

1942
02:12:01,210 --> 02:12:02,420
Yes...

1943
02:12:02,500 --> 02:12:03,700
Fine.

1944
02:12:04,470 --> 02:12:09,780
In order to get Mr. Jamnadas'
orphanage and the Colonel's bungalow...

1945
02:12:11,960 --> 02:12:16,430
...Nikhil and I first Jamnadas ...

1946
02:12:18,280 --> 02:12:21,140
Get out and close the door.
The library's closed today.

1947
02:12:21,740 --> 02:12:23,920
Anyone just barges in here.
- Nikhil.

1948
02:12:25,970 --> 02:12:27,140
Nikhil?

1949
02:12:29,390 --> 02:12:32,090
What's going on, Vasu?
- These people are helping me...

1950
02:12:32,170 --> 02:12:33,540
...in getting rid of the ghost.

1951
02:12:33,990 --> 02:12:34,910
Remember, I told you over the phone.

1952
02:12:34,990 --> 02:12:37,050
It's not an illusion.
It's a real spirit.

1953
02:12:37,250 --> 02:12:38,780
And it's here only somewhere

1954
02:12:38,900 --> 02:12:41,390
Anna just spoke with the spirit.

1955
02:12:42,400 --> 02:12:44,450
And that Baba is a very powerful guy.

1956
02:12:44,820 --> 02:12:47,920
Everything he said came true,
ask him yourself.

1957
02:12:55,490 --> 02:12:57,500
If that's the case,
then please tell me...

1958
02:12:58,030 --> 02:13:00,720
...if the spirit is here,
then where is it?

1959
02:13:00,960 --> 02:13:02,860
And, why is it here?

1960
02:13:06,240 --> 02:13:10,910
That spirit is here to
destroy all sinners and evil souls.

1961
02:13:11,030 --> 02:13:13,000
Double Double Toil and Trouble.

1962
02:13:13,080 --> 02:13:15,620
Fire burn and cauldron bubble.

1963
02:13:20,080 --> 02:13:24,140
Vasu, he's not any
baba...he's an imposter.

1964
02:13:26,280 --> 02:13:27,850
There is no spirit here.

1965
02:13:29,500 --> 02:13:31,390
Since the time you have called me,...

1966
02:13:32,680 --> 02:13:35,140
...my men have been keeping
an eye on all of them.

1967
02:13:36,910 --> 02:13:39,120
This is their game-plan, Vasu.

1968
02:13:40,330 --> 02:13:42,870
They are trying to trap
you in one of their plans.

1969
02:13:44,560 --> 02:13:46,610
I'll deal with you guys later.

1970
02:13:47,500 --> 02:13:48,630
Let's go, Vasu.

1971
02:13:52,690 --> 02:13:53,980
Where are you going?

1972
02:13:54,380 --> 02:13:56,120
It's a good thing you came down here.

1973
02:13:56,880 --> 02:13:59,820
Now he wont tell us the truth,
you will tell.

1974
02:14:12,420 --> 02:14:15,280
You killed her.
You tortured her to death.

1975
02:14:22,570 --> 02:14:23,660
Nikhil!

1976
02:14:26,150 --> 02:14:27,520
Inspector Dande.

1977
02:14:28,290 --> 02:14:29,980
So the police is
also involved with you

1978
02:14:30,260 --> 02:14:32,560
The police isn't taking
any sides, Nikhil.

1979
02:14:33,160 --> 02:14:35,010
We know the truth. That's all

1980
02:14:35,620 --> 02:14:38,120
You killed Khushi and Mr. Jamnadas.

1981
02:14:39,600 --> 02:14:40,770
I see...

1982
02:14:40,970 --> 02:14:44,920
And you all have gathered
here to collect evidence.

1983
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:47,700
So, tell me what
evidence did you find?

1984
02:14:49,590 --> 02:14:51,440
Come on, tell me what's the proof?

1985
02:14:57,950 --> 02:14:59,720
You guys can't touch me.

1986
02:15:00,120 --> 02:15:02,340
That orphanage belongs to me...legally.

1987
02:15:02,580 --> 02:15:05,280
I'll throw those kids out like that.

1988
02:15:08,940 --> 02:15:11,560
Soon I'll have this
piece of land as well.

1989
02:15:11,760 --> 02:15:13,570
Who can stop me?
You, Mr. Dande?

1990
02:15:14,820 --> 02:15:15,870
Or you guys?

1991
02:15:16,470 --> 02:15:17,440
Who will stop me?

1992
02:15:17,520 --> 02:15:20,620
You? You Gopal? Or your friends?

1993
02:15:20,820 --> 02:15:22,110
Nobody can ...

1994
02:16:22,960 --> 02:16:26,100
Khushi is digging your grave.

1995
02:16:26,580 --> 02:16:29,520
Educating girls imply progress.

1996
02:17:47,200 --> 02:17:51,250
Khushi! Khushi!
- Khushi, please stop it.

1997
02:18:17,600 --> 02:18:21,590
Don't let go. Don't let go.
- Stop encouraging her.

1998
02:18:21,670 --> 02:18:24,050
I mean don't let him go. He'll
die if he falls from this height.

1999
02:18:24,210 --> 02:18:25,380
Khushi.

2000
02:18:26,590 --> 02:18:28,600
Khushi, please stop. Don't do this.

2001
02:18:29,850 --> 02:18:33,510
We want justice through punishment,
and not by killing him.

2002
02:18:34,800 --> 02:18:36,210
Khushi.

2003
02:18:36,650 --> 02:18:39,630
Khushi, wherever you are.
Please forgive him.

2004
02:18:39,710 --> 02:18:40,960
Tell them, Nikhil.

2005
02:18:41,240 --> 02:18:44,140
Confess that you killed
Khushi and Jamnadas.

2006
02:18:47,930 --> 02:18:50,670
Killing him won't
get us the orphanage back.

2007
02:18:51,830 --> 02:18:56,220
Think about the orphanage
and the children.

2008
02:19:40,760 --> 02:19:44,420
You know, we found you at that gate

2009
02:19:47,320 --> 02:19:48,290
There?

2010
02:20:54,410 --> 02:20:56,270
'It's said that when a person dies...'

2011
02:20:56,550 --> 02:20:58,360
'...and his soul attains salvation,...

2012
02:20:58,640 --> 02:21:01,740
...it's the beginning
of a new journey for him...'

2013
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:03,030
'...which we call the Afterlife.'

2014
02:21:05,120 --> 02:21:09,430
'There are no sorrows
or pain in this Afterlife.'

2015
02:21:09,890 --> 02:21:12,060
'Nothing right or wrong.'

2016
02:21:12,960 --> 02:21:16,340
Just a soothing light all around us...'

2017
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:19,920
'...and, we all converge in it finally.'

2018
02:21:21,200 --> 02:21:24,000
'We don't know whether
it's true or not.'

2019
02:21:24,820 --> 02:21:28,000
'But yes... When God's
will is involved...'

2020
02:21:28,490 --> 02:21:32,000
'...there is no logic, only magic.'
