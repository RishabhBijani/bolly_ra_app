00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:02,680
..the myth and the most
wanted outlaw of the world D.

00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,640
"Everybody is busy battling
and life has been locked."

00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,840
"Every minute selfie sis
clicked and posted on instagram."

7
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,280
"24 hours on phone
and life is on loan."

8
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:44,160
"He cannot do anything
and finds faults in others."

9
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,040
"The nation wants to know."

10
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,120
"The nation wants to know."

11
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,520
"There is nothing to say
but the nation wants to know."

12
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,400
"Your world has become useless."

13
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,440
"Your world has become useless."

14
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,400
"Your world has become useless."

15
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,160
"Oh God.."

16
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,720
"Your world has become useless."

17
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,880
"Why don't you understand?"

18
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:08,600
"Your world has become useless.
Oh God.."

19
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,160
"Thousands of scams happen in crores."

20
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,240
"Money is power and will
get anything done from anyone."

21
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:38,440
"Every hour there is breaking news.
At least million views."

22
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:42,840
"They unnecessary create
issues and main issue is ignored."

23
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,480
"The nation wants to know."

24
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,560
"The nation wants to know."

25
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:51,080
"There is nothing to say
but the nation wants to know."

26
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,120
'Your world has become useless."

27
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,000
"Your world has become useless."

28
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:58,200
"Your world has become useless.
Oh God.."

29
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,200
"Your world has become useless."

30
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,280
"Why don't you understand?"

31
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,000
"Your world has become useless.
Oh God.."

32
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,840
So Mr. Vachani you want to say that..

33
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,360
..the core committee
does not take responsibility..

34
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,600
..for spokes person's live comments.

35
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,480
Look I..
- Answer my question, Mr. Vachani.

36
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,120
I am..
- You will have to answer my question.

37
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:27,840
Answer me first.

38
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,360
Let me also...
- Answer me first, Mr. Vachani.

39
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,080
Let me speak.
- Answer me first.

40
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,120
You will have to answer Mr. Vachani.

41
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,200
I am speaking. Let me speak.
- Answer me.

42
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,200
I am giving.

43
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,600
Answer me.
- I am speaking.

44
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,360
Answer me first, Mr. Vachani.

45
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,520
You have to.

46
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,400
Okay.

47
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,440
Mr Vachani who is promoting
the campaign of save water..

48
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:53,480
..has wasted one glass of water here.

49
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:58,320
This means that today without
worrying about anything..

50
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,400
..you are publicly going against
the cause you are supporting.

51
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,280
Why don't you let me speak anything?
- Answer me first.

52
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,920
Shall I say something?
- You have to answer me.

53
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,160
Okay.

54
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,800
You have thrown the political
ideology of your party on my face.

55
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,600
What are you saying?
- You cannot do that.

56
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,840
That means you do not believe in
the political ideology of your party.

57
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,560
I..
- That's what you want to say.

58
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:27,720
You have insulted and made fun of
the 150 years old party, Mr. Vachani.

59
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,000
There is no joke..

60
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,640
Come on sir let's go. It is
live telecast. Everybody is listening.

61
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,680
Let's go sir.

62
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,240
Hey, he is amazing.

63
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,320
He is talking nonstop like
bullet train without a break.

64
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,720
If you call us in studio..

65
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,400
..then give us chance to speak.
- You answer me.

66
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,240
Let's go sir.

67
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,880
Do you know how much preparation
we do before coming here?

68
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,360
Let's go.
- He does not understand.

69
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,400
It is a limit.
Leave me.

70
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,880
Answer me Mr. Vachani.

71
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,480
He..
- You cannot leave like this.

72
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,080
It is matter of everyday.

73
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,280
Come every day and
get insulted in Prime time.

74
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,760
You..
- What do you have to say my friend?

75
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,760
You tell me.

76
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,160
Understand one thing that..

77
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,680
..even politicians have some dignity.
Understood.

78
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,720
Do answer me Mr. Vachani.

79
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,520
You cannot do that.

80
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,520
Mr. Vachani you have to answer.

81
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,520
Give the phone to Pankaj.

82
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,720
Pankaj, first of all cut the feed now.

83
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,320
And switch it to something else.

84
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,240
Anything.

85
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,480
And secondly remove Arnab
from prime time slot from Monday.

86
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,040
Listen, ask Neha to come to studio.

87
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,840
Everyone go out.
I want to talk to Arnab.

88
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,120
Hey, go out.

89
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,840
What?

90
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,080
Hey..

91
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,000
How did you get wet?

92
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,360
I threw water on myself.

93
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,480
I can give away my life.
- Yes of course.

94
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,400
Listen, Arnab from tomorrow
you will do the 7-8PM slot.

95
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,040
Now will I have to do 7-8 as well?

96
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,680
No, no you will have to do that only.

97
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,840
Only that.

98
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,560
What?
- Yes.

99
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,720
7-8 PM means.

100
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,240
Now will I tell people
how to cook food?

101
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:11,440
Yes. It is cookery slot so understand
what and how you will do it.

102
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,760
What the hell Roy?

103
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,880
What the hell? You tell me.

104
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,400
Really.

105
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,840
First you were saying that TRP is
not coming and losses are mounting up.

106
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,680
Now TRP is coming
and you have a problem.

107
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,840
Do you increase TRP like this?

108
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,720
Is this the way to increase TRP?

109
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,600
Okay.

110
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,320
Now you remember the
chapters of moral science.

111
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,600
Very nice.

112
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:36,840
What happened?

113
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,000
Burn it.
- Warning comes downstairs.

114
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,720
Look at Neha's shows, buddy.

115
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,320
Pure fashion reporting
delivered with a pinch of salt.

116
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,920
And ratings are good too.

117
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,040
Nobody is complaining.

118
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,680
Roy, to make shows
on lingerie and sex..

119
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,400
..and to openly challenge
politicians on a live show..

120
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,640
..is two different things.

121
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,880
Oh hello, mind your language.

122
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:01,400
It is not lingerie show but
India's best glamour update show.

123
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:01,840
Oh.

124
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,800
I am the best news
writer in the country.

125
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,560
I am doing this show on Roy's request.

126
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,680
Why are you involving
me into this debate?

127
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,800
Take your beauty parlor out.

128
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,560
There is no need to do this here.

129
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,560
I am here because Roy called me.

130
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,840
And I am getting the
prime time slot of your show.

131
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,760
Yeah..

132
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:20,840
What?

133
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,120
Yes..

134
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,240
Will Neha do prime
time slot on my place?

135
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,080
Have you literally taken
the show by its name? One on one.

136
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,040
If she does the show then
politicians will give fewer answers..

137
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,920
..and will give phone
numbers to her more.

138
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,240
I am leaving Roy.

139
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:39,040
Let me know when Mr.
Angry pans has cooled down.

140
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,040
I will come later.
- No, no Neha.

141
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,200
You are not going anywhere.
Wait, wait..

142
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:48,120
This man must know how important
it is to change with time.

143
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,640
Even you know that..

144
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,880
..Neha used to be the best
writer in the news business.

145
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,600
Okay.

146
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,920
She is doing this show
because the channel needs her.

147
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,320
You know flexibility.

148
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,280
Shut up.

149
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,400
Have cup and smell the coffee.

150
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,040
No one wants to see
your show nowadays.

151
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,520
It is okay that ratings
were fine today but at what cost.

152
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,800
Tomorrow RGV will come.

153
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,760
Again I will have to give answer about
6 cameras, 4 mikes and so many bones.

154
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,760
Do you know that?

155
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,240
It is not my fault that you
cannot handle political hooliganism.

156
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,120
My work was to handle heated
debates and that I was doing.

157
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,600
Until you..
Hello. What is it?

158
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,080
I said I will get the watermelon.
Watermelon, watermelon....

159
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,000
Yes baby..

160
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,160
Nothing, nothing..

161
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:50,160
I have chucked out an office boy
so he is getting angry and shouting.

162
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,000
Yes.

163
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,400
I will get it.

164
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:53,840
Sure.

165
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,720
Bye sweetheart.

166
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,520
Sorry I did not see.

167
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,120
I was in heated debate so I got..

168
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,640
It was not a heated debate.

169
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,640
It was hardly a debate.

170
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,080
You had said at 10'0clock.

171
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,920
Why is so much shouting
happening outside?

172
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,320
Stop it.
- Stop it, Pankaj.

173
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,560
Don't laugh, Arnab.

174
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,440
A 70 year old man crying on
prime time.. it was not heated debate.

175
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,760
It seemed as if you have snatched
a lollipop from a 6 year old child.

176
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,480
Did you see the way he was crying?

177
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,160
But it was good one, yeah..

178
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,760
Arnab!

179
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,520
You were a good news anchor.
- Thanks.

180
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,920
But this drama cannot
continue every day, buddy.

181
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,040
Even you know it. It is not feasible.

182
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,360
People want to see some real stuff.

183
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,240
Remember those days when
people would leave their dinner..

184
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,640
..and sit in front of the TV.

185
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:59,360
Which topic would Arnab discuss on?
Who will be court martial?

186
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,400
It's gone buddy.

187
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,760
Look!

188
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,200
I can't sustain like this.

189
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,640
Even the order from top management has
come that we have got 2 months time.

190
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,360
We have to make profit by them.

191
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,120
Otherwise everything finished.

192
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,560
Channel is finished. You are finished.

193
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,360
You are under estimating me, Roy.

194
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,080
Do you remember..

195
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,120
..that I had brought the
channel to the top position?

196
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,080
It was me who had made
the channel the biggest brand.

197
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,280
When a person talks
about past again and again..

198
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:42,360
..then one should understand
that there is some problem.

199
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,560
And you very well know
it what the problem is.

200
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,040
Do something.

201
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,360
You can do it.
You have done it before as well.

202
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,040
Think huge.

203
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:58,920
Otherwise many people
are pushing me for 7-8 slot.

204
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
So now Arnab Ghosh..

205
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,320
..will have to compete
with chef Kapoor for screen time.

206
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,920
What the hell?
- Neha, please.

207
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,600
Buddy, think of something.

208
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,280
Think of something quickly.

209
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,080
We just have two months time.
- Hey..

210
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,360
Pankaj, will this noise stop or not?

211
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,600
Sir I am vinod.

212
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,240
Vinod, is this a
studio or a fish market?

213
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,200
Come baby.

214
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:02,000
"Whosoever you bless Haji Ali..."

215
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:06,760
"He need not worry at all,
Haji Ali, Haji Ali.."

216
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:11,640
"Whosoever you bless Haji Ali.."

217
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:16,320
"He need not worry at all,
Haji Ali, Haji Ali.."

218
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,760
"Ali, Ali Haji Ali.."

219
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,160
"Ali, Ali Haji Ali.."

220
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,560
"Ali, Ali Haji Ali.."

221
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,440
"Ali, Ali Haji Ali.."

222
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:38,000
"Haji Ali.."

223
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:42,440
"My Haji Ali.."

224
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:47,560
"The day is not good
so help to let it pass soon."

225
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:52,400
"Give my life a direction."

226
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,200
"Change my bad luck into good luck."

227
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:02,240
"Help me to come out of problems."

228
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:11,440
"Bless me; help me to find my way."

229
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,000
"Ali, Ali Haji Ali.."

230
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,320
"Ali, Ali Haji Ali.."

231
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,760
"Ali, Ali Haji Ali.."

232
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,160
"Ali, Ali Haji Ali.."

233
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,520
"Ali, Ali Haji Ali.."

234
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,000
"Ali, Ali Haji Ali.."

235
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,800
"Ali, Ali Haji Ali.."

236
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,680
What happened? Why have you
made face like a grilled chicken?

237
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:52,320
Many people make a mistake of removing
the chicken before it is grilled.

238
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,400
Look at this.
It should be of this color.

239
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,640
Till that time let be on grill.

240
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,600
I am being thrashed in
the office and you are joking.

241
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,400
Are you just being
thrashed and not me?

242
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,800
That also from my own child.

243
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,680
It is 4th month. Do you remember?

244
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,080
Sorry.
- Sorry.

245
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,760
Then you must be enjoying?
- What?

246
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,680
I mean.. sorry baby.
After making chicken roast....

247
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,840
I mean..now is turn of spices.

248
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,040
..people are happy when the
child kicks for the first time.

249
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,480
Like that I said. Yes.

250
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,880
You know everything..

251
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,120
..then you do it.

252
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,000
I am sorry.

253
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,680
How are you feeling?

254
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,040
Does someone talk like
this with pregnant woman?

255
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,760
Of course I am feeling awful.

256
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,240
Leave it.

257
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,280
Okay.

258
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,880
Now tell me what has happened?

259
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,600
Or you want me to read your face.

260
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,120
Shall I say the truth?

261
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,240
No, tell me the story of Harry Potter.
Of course, tell me the truth.

262
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,480
I have been removed
from the prime time slot.

263
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,920
What?
- I will do the cookery show. 7-8 PM.

264
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,920
Like this.

265
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,200
Shit.

266
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,320
But what happened suddenly today.

267
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,920
Roy said it point blankly
that we have two months.

268
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,760
If the ratings don't
go up we are doomed.

269
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,800
Channel will shut down.

270
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:26,800
You will get another assignment. I
mean there is no other Arnab in India.

271
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,240
It is not that easy.

272
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,360
I will not get a second
chance failing at my level.

273
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,360
And even if I get I can't
expect to be paid like before.

274
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,800
It is too much.

275
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,720
I have booked so many
thing online for the baby.

276
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,480
Don't worry.
We will figure something out.

277
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,480
Life is already going on loan.

278
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,760
If we do not do something quickly..

279
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,000
..then we will have
to come from Toyota to Tata.

280
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,480
If you do not have budget for
cashew nuts then there is no problem.

281
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:10,400
We can use groundnuts
to make this dish cheaper.

282
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,560
There will be a slight
change in taste.

283
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,000
Tell me, what you did the whole day.

284
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,920
Browsing but did not buy anything.

285
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,720
What were you finding?

286
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,160
White Sari.

287
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,720
What?
- What?

288
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,080
Don't be so surprised Arnab.

289
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,080
I will have to buy because
of the way you insult..

290
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,040
..the politicians on live TV.

291
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,280
Sometimes I feel..

292
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,120
..I should have taken the
offer of News India two years back.

293
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,000
They are on top of the charts now.

294
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,520
Relax Arnab.

295
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,560
Whatever happens is for good.

296
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,880
The important thing is that
you cannot control everything.

297
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,240
So just let it be.

298
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,800
It is very easy to talk.

299
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,160
You feel regretted thinking
practically about it.

300
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,280
You know that time I got the offer.

301
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,560
May be.

302
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,040
Listen.

303
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,360
I have to tell you something.
- Tell me.

304
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,880
Tell me.

305
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,240
Do you remember the night I conceived?

306
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,880
You came late from studio that day.

307
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,400
Shekhar had come home before you came.

308
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,840
Shekhar, your ex boyfriend.

309
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,280
Okay.

310
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,320
We just got talking and had some wine.

311
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,640
One thing just led to another and..

312
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,080
I..

313
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,600
You know women get stupid
and emotional sometimes.

314
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,800
What are you going to say?

315
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,280
I..

316
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,440
Speak.

317
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:56,200
I am not too sure
but I am just confused.

318
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,720
Maybe this baby is yours or his..

319
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,600
I don't know.

320
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:07,040
Male snake attracts the
female snake with his smell.

321
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:12,720
After the female snake agrees
they both enjoy sex for many hours.

322
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,240
Are you enjoying?

323
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,800
What do you mean by saying that?

324
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,640
Don't worry. It is yours.

325
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,760
I just wanted to say
that things can go worst.

326
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:37,040
So you learn to respect
your achievements, husband.

327
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,200
Relax.

328
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,000
I am going to sleep, good night.

329
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,400
Good night.

330
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,080
Okay, okay how old is the story?

331
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,720
Hot tea..
- Okay.

332
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,920
Are you sure it is untapped.
- Hot tea..

333
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,040
Hot tea..

334
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,400
Hot tea sir.

335
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,520
Hot tea sir. - Tell me
something more about the story.

336
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,320
More means more about it.
- Take it sir.

337
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,440
What.
- Take it sir.

338
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,840
Okay political history.

339
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,320
I'll call you back.

340
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,720
Sit down.
- What happened, sir?

341
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,080
Wasn't morning tea nice?
- Sit down.

342
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,480
Were the tea leaves more?

343
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:09,680
I had told the people in the
pantry that sir has gastric problem.

344
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,040
Put the tea leaves less.

345
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,200
Sit down.
- Okay sir.

346
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,160
What is this?
- This is tea sir.

347
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,720
It is very nice.

348
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
You are bringing tea
in every five minutes.

349
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,800
Give me time to drink tea.

350
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,040
Drink one more sir. It is very nice.

351
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,640
Tea is always hot and
people enjoy it while drinking.

352
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,840
Are you making me drink
tea or watering the plants?

353
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:39,440
Sir, you are getting angry.
You work so hard.

354
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,440
So you will drink more tea.

355
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,200
Drink it sir.

356
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,280
It is nice.

357
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:47,240
If you say it once again that it is
nice then I will press my throat or....

358
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,680
Don't get angry sir.

359
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,200
I will bring it later.

360
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,240
Don't bring it later.

361
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,600
Don't bring it.

362
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,600
You are a makeup and not a tea seller.

363
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:00,720
I don't understand
why are you after tea.

364
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,800
There is a difference between
profession and passion, sir.

365
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,800
You know it well that I love to make
others drink tea from college times.

366
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:12,000
Why are you spoiling your career?

367
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,320
I don't see a bright future.

368
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,760
You cannot make a career
by making others drink tea.

369
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,920
If you do hard work then one day
you will be in front of the camera.

370
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,600
Your mother wanted to see you on TV.

371
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:24,160
Yes sir.
She wants it but..

372
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,520
..what does she know about passion.

373
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,440
Sir, you don't seem
to be in god mood sir.

374
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,400
Oh really.

375
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,720
Are you getting angry with
me because of tasteless tea?

376
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,040
God, just kill me.

377
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,040
Today I will finish this debate.
- Okay.

378
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:41,800
Where is brother?

379
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,440
Where is brother?
- He is Ranchi?

380
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,600
Yesterday it came in the news.

381
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,640
Where is your brother, idiot.

382
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,720
That courier man.

383
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,840
Okay, choosy.

384
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,800
I will just call him, sir.
- Call him.

385
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,000
Hello.

386
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,760
Sorry Ajay,
I got caught up with some office work.

387
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,320
Tell me what you were saying.

388
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,520
Okay.

389
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:07,720
Yes..

390
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,640
Correct, correct..

391
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,320
Okay..

392
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,200
Yes, will see. Sir, Choosy..

393
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,280
Good afternoon sir.
Do you want to courier something?

394
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,000
Okay.

395
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:18,920
Right.

396
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,640
So send it till tomorrow.

397
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:21,680
Okay.

398
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,320
Sir, just say yes once.

399
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,480
Once you said yes means
your things have gone, sir.

400
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,280
I will call you in five minutes.
Boss has called me. Okay.

401
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,600
He has called me urgently. Bye.

402
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,200
Sir, did sister-in-law
get the bouquet?

403
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,760
Did you send it?

404
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:39,840
Listen.

405
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,880
Do whatever you feel is right.
I just have one request to make.

406
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:43,600
What sir?

407
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,320
You make me drink the
entire year's tea in one day.

408
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,920
After that you will
never make me drink tea.

409
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,240
Okay. And you.

410
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,320
This..

411
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,600
This is your border.

412
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,600
You will courier things of others..

413
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:59,160
..and you will not courier
anything inside this.

414
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,320
Swear it.

415
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,000
Okay sir.
- Not mine but yours.

416
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,160
Okay sir.
- Not of yours but of each other's.

417
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,560
Okay..
- Get lost from here.

418
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,600
Okay sir.

419
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,000
This is your limit.

420
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,200
I had told him..

421
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,520
..to make tea less strong

422
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,600
It is gas so it will
come out from somewhere.

423
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,680
You are right.

424
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,880
Yes Ajay, I was in a meeting.

425
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:17,720
Yes.

426
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,640
Any updates. Did Roy say anything?

427
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,440
Nothing new.

428
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,720
You tell me how your day was.

429
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,520
Crime Patrol 8 episodes.

430
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,920
Back to back.

431
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,480
Wow! Women crave for sweet
or sour things in pregnancy.

432
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,360
My wife has craving for crime.

433
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:39,760
Thank you God.

434
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,080
I am blessed.
- You are such a drama.

435
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,800
Such a drama. God.

436
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:47,080
In one episode there was a guy..

437
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:50,000
..who was caught stealing
bricks from the construction site.

438
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,880
Can you believe which
gang he belonged to?

439
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,120
No one told me.

440
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,600
D gang.

441
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:58,480
I mean imagine D gang
has to steal bricks.

442
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,920
What is so weird?
Many people of D gang are struggling.

443
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,640
Brother has escaped
and has left boys behind..

444
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,040
..to steal bricks and steel rods.

445
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:07,560
Anyways...

446
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,160
I have heard that he
is still active here. I mean..

447
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,000
People say he has
many investments here.

448
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,080
People say many things..

449
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,760
..but for me what matters
is that what you say.

450
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,680
Imagine..

451
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,320
..it would be so
cool to interview him.

452
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,240
I mean one on one
with the man himself.

453
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,160
Sensational.

454
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,560
Are you hypnotizing me?

455
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,160
You have already been hypnotized.

456
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,640
Keep these crime patrol
dangerous ideas with you.

457
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,720
Otherwise you will really
have to wear white sari.

458
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,080
You are such a buzz kill.

459
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,360
It did not go in the mouth.

460
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,320
Once more.
- Take this.

461
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,080
Clean it. I am going to bed.

462
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,080
I'll have two drinks and come.

463
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,680
Imagine it would be
so cool to interview him.

464
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,680
One on one with the man himself.

465
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,760
Sensational.

466
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,240
Parul.

467
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:22,920
Parul..

468
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,280
Baby..

469
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:30,440
What is it Arnab so late at night?
You scared me.

470
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,720
I came to compliment you.

471
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,080
For what?

472
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,240
You had give me a useless
idea to interview D.

473
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,120
So will you insult me
by waking me up from sleep?

474
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,720
No, it is not a bad idea at all.

475
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,200
Good for you.
- I am going to pitch it Roy.

476
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,040
All the best.

477
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,040
Are you excited?

478
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:51,800
Very much.

479
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,600
How did you like this idea?

480
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:01,720
What?

481
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,400
Is it risky?

482
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,320
Don't worry..

483
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,000
..your birth certificate
will have my name.

484
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,480
You tell me what I shall
get for you from there.

485
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,760
Gun.

486
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,720
They have the real one.

487
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,640
Sleep.

488
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,120
You are very naughty.

489
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,880
Remember that the flame
should not be high..

490
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
..otherwise the spoon
and wok both can burn.

491
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,640
Greetings, sir.

492
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,080
Greetings.

493
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,800
Sir, there is no
balance in your phone.

494
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,480
Do you want to get it recharged?

495
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,080
That will be done.

496
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,840
Smiling bright face.

497
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,280
Do you want to set a caller tune?

498
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:50,880
Black hair and golden color..

499
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,040
How is the weather there?

500
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,360
Shut up, idiot.

501
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,880
Girdhari, come quickly.
Brother is calling you at the pool.

502
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,000
How are you dear?

503
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,680
You do not miss me these days.

504
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,800
Why should I miss you?

505
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,600
I have found someone here.

506
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,800
You uncle..

507
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,360
Okay.

508
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,560
Yes brother.

509
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,480
Go and kill Sheela.

510
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:22,280
Now. I want to hear
the sound of the bullet.

511
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,120
As you say, brother.
The work will be done.

512
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,800
Okay fine.

513
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,640
Girdhari.

514
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,680
Meet him.

515
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:35,000
He is the owner of GML group Mr.
Arshad Ansari.

516
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:35,920
Mr. Ansari.

517
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,640
He is Girdhari and
takes care of my work.

518
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,680
Greetings..

519
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,920
Don't go on his face.

520
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,440
He is innocent to look
at but he is very clever.

521
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:56,040
So brother, get my work
done about which I had told you.

522
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,000
Yes.

523
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,280
Girdhari.

524
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,720
He says that he had asked..

525
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:06,320
..to threaten the builder
but we have not called.

526
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,120
Yes.

527
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:13,440
Tell me from there.
Tell in front of everyone.

528
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,720
I don't like whispering in business.

529
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,800
Why are you shaking the phone?
Tell me what it is.

530
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,040
I did not have balance in the phone.

531
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,400
That is why I wanted
to tell you in your ears.

532
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,040
Are all other phones dead?

533
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,000
Where was Mehmood's phone?

534
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,680
Sir, Mehmood's phone
is not good quality.

535
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,240
There are so many landlines
in the house. What are they for?

536
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,920
Actually brother tele marketing
people have troubled..

537
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,840
..people so much that
they do not pick up landline.

538
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,400
I tried many times.

539
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,120
Mr. Ansari.

540
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,920
You go and your work will be done.

541
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,040
Don't bother about what he is talking.
He has the habit of eating opium.

542
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:59,120
Okay brother, now that you
are saying then it will be done.

543
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,200
You should have got it recharged.

544
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,560
Bother you do not know.

545
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:08,280
I have to beg for
100/- to the accountant..

546
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,640
..and he says there is no collection.
- One minute. One minute.

547
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,920
Is this enough for recharge?

548
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,440
Yes it is enough.

549
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,560
Brother.

550
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,640
For 10 days vegetables have
not been bought leave aside mutton.

551
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,400
Sprinkle salt on me and eat.

552
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,680
We are there because of you.

553
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:27,600
Sir.

554
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,200
Sir, I feel to increase the TRP..

555
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,440
..we will have to do
something path breaking.

556
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,400
Roy, you are going to thank me.

557
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,880
Yes, you were saying something Peter.

558
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,040
Sir. I think we will
have to do something new sir.

559
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,040
You say it every time but what new.

560
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:44,880
Sir.

561
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,480
You must have read what I had said.

562
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,040
Yes. What I had said?

563
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,080
I want to do something for women.

564
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:54,000
What is interesting in this?
Who will see?

565
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,120
Listen sir.

566
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,760
we will put an original twist in this.

567
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:58,920
I am listening.

568
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:04,720
The headlines of our news
piece would be 'Manch Pe Kiya Bawal'

569
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,560
I want to do women.

570
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,640
It would become a rage, sir.
- Great.

571
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,800
Very nice, very nice..

572
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:12,120
Later we will put all
the blame on the edit, sir.

573
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,640
Superb.
- We are safe.

574
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,880
There will not be
rage but riot, idiot.

575
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:16,880
Get out.

576
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,680
Good for nothing.

577
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,040
Sir..
- Out.

578
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,040
Okay.

579
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:29,320
So..
- Rajat, you were saying something.

580
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:32,320
Sir, Peter spoke my idea.

581
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:35,240
This always happens, sir. I
had come here to tell you about this.

582
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,880
Get out.
- Sir..

583
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:37,880
Get out.

584
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,800
Sir, my idea.
- Just leave.

585
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:44,320
Get out.

586
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,880
Go..

587
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,440
Our luck is not bad but
we have kept wrong people.

588
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,240
What is it? It was my idea.

589
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,840
Get lost.

590
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:05,520
Get lost.

591
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,440
It was my idea. Get lost.
- Rascal.

592
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,040
I will tell everyone
that it was my idea. Rascal...

593
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,640
Thief..
- Go and tell.

594
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,200
I have seen many people like you.

595
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,360
How did you like the idea?
- Rubbish idea.

596
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,040
What do you think, Neha?

597
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:22,040
Stupid, utter garbage
and I can go on and on..

598
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,520
Look, our luck is not bad.

599
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,920
What does Neha know?

600
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,320
Roy, I think you did
not hear it properly.

601
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:32,200
I heard it and imagined it in my mind.

602
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:35,840
At the end of imagination
I saw that we both are dead.

603
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,240
Hence.

604
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,280
Rubbish.

605
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:43,320
Roy, till today D
has not been interviewed.

606
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:46,720
This is going to be big.
- Big..

607
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,600
D has not been interviewed because
they are many reasons behind it.

608
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,640
He is dangerous, he is impossible.

609
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,440
This is a life risking idea.

610
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,720
Every big idea seems
to be risky in the beginning.

611
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,240
Don't be poetic.

612
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,480
I asked you to get idea
to save the channel and..

613
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,000
And this is what you come up with.

614
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:04,400
Tomorrow you would say that
you need Sayyed Hafiz's interview.

615
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,920
Day after tomorrow
you would say that..

616
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,760
..you need interview
of Veerappan's cousin.

617
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,320
Have you gone mad?

618
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:14,880
Roy, you are saying this? It is
not that no one has done this before.

619
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:18,280
Going by the history in 1959
the famous British..

620
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,800
..journalist Graham
Smith had done this.

621
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,000
Quite successfully.

622
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,040
Did he interview D?

623
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:28,640
In 1959 D was in nursery. Why would
anyone interview a nursery child?

624
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,600
He interviewed the famous
mafia king of Italy Fabio Castilana.

625
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,720
The one and only interview with him.

626
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,000
What happened of that
Graham Smith? He died.

627
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:39,920
Did you see?

628
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,160
He died of heart attack.
Natural death.

629
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,400
What to see in everything?

630
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:48,000
Whatever it was a bad idea.
Go out and get thinking.

631
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,440
And let me also think.

632
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,600
This plan of mine..
- Even you think it over Roy.

633
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:54,040
These TRP's and ratings
will be left behind.

634
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,280
This will make us legendary.

635
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,640
There will be no stopping us.

636
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,040
The door is that side. Forgive me.

637
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:04,120
Roy..Neha you tell him.
- I'll show you.

638
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,920
For the fashion segment..

639
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,600
Our luck is bad.

640
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,400
Will that be okay?

641
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,280
Good afternoon Mr. Chopra.

642
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,520
We are on it.
You don't have to worry sir.

643
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:28,080
Sir, I know I have said
this many times before..

644
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,040
..but this time I mean it sir.

645
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:36,920
I used to mean it earlier also
but all these things take time, sir.

646
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:42,360
I know I have less time sir.
Just 2 months.

647
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,880
Sir we are working on
some new ideas and I am sure..

648
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,880
..ratings will back up in no time.

649
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:53,480
Trust me sir.
We will turn things around.

650
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:59,080
Sir, you have already told
about this time of 2 months.

651
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,120
No, no sir I did not mean that.

652
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,160
You can say as many times as you want.

653
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,880
Okay, good day sir.

654
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,520
Yes Roy..

655
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,320
Arnab, go ahead with the interview.

656
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:59,240
I thought about your idea. Okay
but will what will happen with that.

657
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,080
I have ideas.

658
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,600
I am scared of those.

659
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:07,480
Listen to me. We will provoke him.

660
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,560
Okay. How?

661
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,080
What is D proud of the most?

662
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:16,840
Money, power, status and the
fact that people are scared of him.

663
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,080
Correct.
- So..

664
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,720
We will challenge him.

665
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:25,320
We will challenge everything.
Money, power, status and everything.

666
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,440
What will happen because of that?

667
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:29,800
That will make him angrier
and that is not good at all.

668
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,440
It will happen. I am telling you.

669
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,240
Just keep watching.

670
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,600
One minute, one minute..

671
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:37,200
I don't want the channel to
be in any danger, Arnab. Understood.

672
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,760
Wherever there is
Arnab there is danger..

673
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,160
..and wherever there
is danger there is Arnab.

674
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,000
Shut up.

675
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:44,320
I have this figured out. Come on.

676
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,280
Champion.

677
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,040
Okay.

678
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,720
Rami..
- Yes sir.

679
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,480
I was about to get tea.

680
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,520
Not tea but where is your brother?

681
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,160
He is here, sir. What happened?

682
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,120
Did he again couriered something?

683
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,040
No, no call him here in 2 minutes.

684
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,400
He will not be able
to come in 2 minutes.

685
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,000
Why?

686
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,600
Because he will come in 2 seconds.

687
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,760
He is here. Choosy.
- Greetings sir.

688
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,320
What are you doing here?

689
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,480
Sir, it had gone bad.
- Listen..

690
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,160
Okay.

691
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,040
Neha, where are you?

692
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,680
I need to see you immediately.

693
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,560
Okay, I am coming. Yes.

694
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:40,440
Parul should not come to
know about this. You know it, right.

695
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,560
That is about later.
First tell me that..

696
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,000
..why should I do it?

697
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,280
There is no scientific reason in it.

698
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,480
Just do it for old times' sake.

699
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,080
For old times' sake?
- Yes.

700
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:07,160
Last month when I had
asked a favor from you..

701
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,120
..then where had old times' gone.

702
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:11,880
You have gone mad.

703
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,520
You wanted to have sex with me.

704
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,720
And I am just telling you
to write the script of the interview.

705
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,800
There is a difference.
- What is the difference?

706
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,120
That time I was desperate
and today you are desperate.

707
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:29,120
By giving this stupid reason do not
prove yourself to be right, please.

708
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,040
And what the hell are you doing?

709
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:35,080
Okay I will write interview for you.

710
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:35,880
Thanks.

711
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,680
One minute, one minute..

712
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,480
That one minute has come.

713
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,600
Stop this striptease of yours first.

714
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,160
I have two conditions.

715
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,680
First that you will atke
me with you for the interview.

716
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,800
And you will mention
my name on live TV.

717
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,840
And give me credit for it.

718
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:58,720
What are you saying?
I am not interviewing a street dog.

719
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:02,680
Understand the seriousness of the
situation. I am going to interview D.

720
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,680
It is risky.

721
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:07,160
Okay, then I have other works also.

722
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,440
I'll see you in some time.

723
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:12,400
Listen, okay.

724
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,880
Good. Now second condition.

725
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,160
Now nothing. Done.

726
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:20,120
Nothing more.

727
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:29,600
After the interview
I want you for one night.

728
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,280
Are you crazy?

729
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:32,840
Just think it over.

730
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:36,480
This is the biggest
interview of your life.

731
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:39,520
I am India's biggest news writer.

732
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,200
No, no..

733
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,320
You can think over it and let me know.

734
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:49,080
Listen. Okay.

735
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,920
Really.

736
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:55,640
I have already put my life on stake
and now let it be my dignity as well.

737
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:08,880
I love you..you are my life

738
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:14,480
I am living because of you.

739
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,000
I love you..you are my life

740
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,280
There is good news.
- Really.

741
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,880
I thought only I was
going to give good news.

742
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,120
I didn't know you also..

743
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:25,680
What?

744
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:27,840
Roy has agreed.

745
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,000
I am going to interview D.

746
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,280
What?
- Yes baby.

747
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:35,760
Oh my God.
That is so cool.

748
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,880
No, no..

749
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,480
Yes baby.
- No..

750
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:40,360
Yes..
- Go and do your work.

751
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,800
Go and get started.
Come on.

752
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,760
This is my work.
- Come on.

753
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,600
No, this is not your work.
That is your work, go.

754
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,400
Okay let me make a drink then.
- Okay.

755
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:52,640
I will have to be punished
for falling in love.

756
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:37,360
Today the weather is very pleasant.

757
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:41,840
What is this? Does the
vegetable cart look like this?

758
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,720
Fish and lady finger together.
What is this?

759
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:49,600
Madam, I have a rule and that..

760
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:52,720
..is I sell only female
things on my cart.

761
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,280
That is why fish with lady finger.

762
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:59,000
And colocasia with fish
and gourd with colocasia.

763
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,560
Do you want to say something else?

764
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,440
It will help in the
making of the video. Stupid.

765
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,520
What a coincidence madam.

766
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:10,880
The vegetables of my cart are
green and your dress is also green.

767
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:13,800
And I have become
excited on seeing you.

768
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,320
Shut up. Shut up.

769
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,760
The shoot has still
not started so be normal.

770
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:22,680
Uncle, you are getting too excited.
- One minute, one minute..

771
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,680
We are not sitting
in neighboring country.

772
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,440
India should be seen. India..

773
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:27,920
Is everything ready?
- Yes.

774
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:30,000
Do it nicely. Give me the mike.

775
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:31,400
Pull it.

776
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:35,920
Rolling..3, 2, 1..action.

777
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:38,800
At this time I am in
the vegetable market f Dongri.

778
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,880
Aslam uncle puts the biggest
cart of vegetables here.

779
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,080
He is with us.

780
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:45,120
Today he is put up a small cart.

781
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:49,320
Aslam uncle, shall we start if
the fishes have gained consciousness.

782
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,160
Yes sir.

783
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,600
We have heard that
famous underworld don D..

784
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,240
..used to buy vegetables from here.

785
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,440
Is this true?

786
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:01,680
But it. That rascal used
to never buy but take them for free.

787
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,720
So you mean to say such a great
underworld don D was a vegetable thief.

788
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,880
Which vegetables he used to steal?

789
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:14,920
I have a cart of 55 vegetables
but D always used to take spinach.

790
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,720
Oh! You want to say that
he was into green veggies.

791
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:20,320
No sir, green veggies were into D.

792
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,000
So you can speak Hindi Urdu.

793
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:25,520
Absolutely.
I mean he had a problem of piles.

794
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,480
You mean to say piles.

795
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:31,920
By changing words the
problem will not subside.

796
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:35,120
So by eating spinach piles are cured.

797
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:38,160
Not by eating sir but by applying.

798
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,920
As you saw Aslam uncle
said that for D it was..

799
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:48,680
..less of vegetable shop
and more of medical store.

800
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:53,040
To send your response
tweet

801
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,440
How much over acting do you do?

802
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:59,000
Let's go.

803
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:05,440
Sir, do you wish to say something
to Arnab about his media stand.

804
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:09,000
He definitely ahs some
connection with that D.

805
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:11,400
It is a game which they
both together are playing with me.

806
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:15,440
Sir, it is quite daring that
a reporter has openly challenged D.

807
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:17,760
Do you want to say something about it?

808
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:19,560
Please stay away. I don't
want to say anything about this.

809
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:22,480
Sir, Arnab insulted you so much and
still you do not want to say anything.

810
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,040
I said leave my way.

811
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:26,040
Please give me the answer, sir.
- Nonsense.

812
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,040
You are an inspector so sit straight.

813
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:48,560
Let me set your moustaches.

814
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,520
Madam..
- What?

815
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,520
I swear upon my mother..
- What?

816
00:44:54,600 --> 00:45:00,720
I mean I swear upon my mother that when
you touch my cheeks I seem to melt.

817
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,840
-Shut up.
-Come on let's start.

818
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:04,480
Are you ready?

819
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:06,600
Okay let's go.

820
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,520
At this time I am outside Nagpada
police station and we have with us..

821
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,200
..senior constable Dougle.
Come let us talk to him.

822
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:17,680
Mr. Dougle we have heard
that D has spent many..

823
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:20,640
..days in this police
station when he was young.

824
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:23,240
Not when he was young but he used
to come here even in his childhood.

825
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,320
Sometimes he used
to puncture the cycle..

826
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:27,120
..or sometimes break
the lock of the neighbors.

827
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,400
I swear he was a very
different kind of a person.

828
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:32,440
So you mean to say that D
has spent a lot of time in this jail.

829
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:34,360
Not only in jail but he has spent..

830
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:36,240
..a lot of time in
the 4*4 room next to that.

831
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,440
What happens there?

832
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:41,200
We try to improve new and
spoilt brats there with love.

833
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,240
Okay, so that means you
have thrashed D many times.

834
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:46,120
One time I let him go.

835
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:48,800
I thrashed him badly.
- Okay.

836
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,200
One day his father
brought him here to me.

837
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:52,560
Okay. Tell us more.

838
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:56,680
Rest all is fine. Wife is unwell.

839
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:58,840
Younger has failed in 10th std.

840
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:00,320
Rest all is well.

841
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,400
Tell about that girl. Stop overacting.

842
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:03,720
Yes..
- Yes tell..

843
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:07,440
I remember he was brought
here once for teasing a girl.

844
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:08,640
So D had teased a girl.

845
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,600
He did not tease but tried to.

846
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:16,080
The girl also thrashed him
and brought her to police station.

847
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,000
That day I felt pity on him.

848
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:19,560
I did not feel like thrashing him.

849
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:21,160
So you did not thrash D.

850
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:24,360
No sir. That day I came
here after fighting with wife.

851
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:25,040
Yes.

852
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:28,360
Does anyone put garlic in
potato and cauliflower vegetable?

853
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:29,160
Does anyone put?

854
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:31,880
No. My mood was very bad.

855
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:33,080
I slapped..

856
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:33,760
Your wife.

857
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:36,800
I dare not slap my wife.
But I slapped D.

858
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,240
Okay.
- Yes..

859
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:41,480
That day I really felt
like thrashing him hard.

860
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:43,400
I missed one and
hit him under the eye.

861
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:44,000
Oh.

862
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:47,920
He wears the glasses to
hide the mark given by my hand.

863
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,840
Many people do not know about it.

864
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:53,000
You just heard what Dougle said.

865
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:58,880
The mark of what he gave
D under the eye still remains.

866
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,640
The question is that mark still there.

867
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:06,160
Tweet your response
at

868
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:22,520
Brother..
- Yes, tell me.

869
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,520
How shall I speak? I am feeling shy.

870
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:30,240
What is the matter?
Have you got vasectomy done?

871
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:33,360
No, no what are you
talking brother. Oh no..

872
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:35,680
Oh God....

873
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:41,680
A chaos about you
is there on social media.

874
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:43,040
About what?

875
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:47,880
The video about you.

876
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:54,520
There is a vegetable seller
who says that you stole his vegetable.

877
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:58,320
There is a policeman who says that..

878
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:01,280
Don't be poetic. Tell me clearly.

879
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:05,840
Policeman is saying that
he had thrashed you hard.

880
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:09,280
That constable is saying so.

881
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:11,880
Show me the video.

882
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
No, no..

883
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,520
Show it to me.
- No..

884
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:21,120
What is this?
This seems to be ammunition shop.

885
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:23,880
This is new one.
Even I had not seen this.

886
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,920
At this moment I am with Mr.
Zuber proprietor of Zuber arms.

887
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:29,240
Mr. Zuber I am with you.

888
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:30,240
Tell me.

889
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:32,760
Did D buy the gun for
the first time from you?

890
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:37,440
Yes sir, we needed
gun oil to repair the guns.

891
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:39,760
The picture as well as sound is good.
- he used to supply.

892
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:40,440
What?

893
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:41,880
He used to supply.

894
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,840
He used to supply. So how long did
this association with him continued?

895
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,680
It could not continue for long
but the matter is that he used to..

896
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:54,000
..steal oil from Mahalaxmi
godown and sell us at cheaper rate.

897
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,520
This must have continued
for 2-3 months..

898
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,000
..and then what could have happened.

899
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:00,680
Mr. Dougle came and arrested him.

900
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:01,240
Okay.

901
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:04,080
He thrashed him so hard that after..

902
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:05,840
..that he was hardly
seen once or twice around.

903
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:09,080
What did you talk with him
whenever you saw him once or twice?

904
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:13,240
Just tell me that does
a man speak who is injured?

905
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:18,480
He wanted to speak a lot but
could not speak with swollen lips.

906
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:19,520
Did he speak?

907
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:21,080
No, he could not speak.
- Okay.

908
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:25,880
All he could say was that he
will not be able to do this business.

909
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:26,440
Okay.

910
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,600
When did he but the
first gun from you?

911
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:33,880
1989. he came here with two friends.

912
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:36,000
He came here to buy three
hand guns and two pistols.

913
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:39,000
What would have been the
cost of 3 hand guns and 2 pistols?

914
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:40,880
There was no sale.

915
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:46,600
There is a ground behind
our godown where guns are tested.

916
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:49,200
I took him there to get the test done.

917
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:53,040
Believe it or not but it seemed
as if he knew nothing about it.

918
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:56,000
He did not know
anything about the gun.

919
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:57,600
Even then he was adamant to shoot.

920
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:00,400
I asked him to shoot
as even I had to make sale.

921
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:04,080
Then he picked up the
gun and started shooting..

922
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:04,520
Yes..

923
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:06,600
..and because of the weight
of the gun the wrist got twisted.

924
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:08,800
And did not hit the aim.
- The aim had to miss.

925
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,080
Absolutely right, sir.

926
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:13,360
But he aimed at the
ceiling of nearby shop.

927
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:15,400
The ceiling fell
and three workers died.

928
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,200
Against his will D
committed his first murder.

929
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:20,800
Okay then what happened?

930
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:24,760
Then I asked him to
leave before any more died.

931
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:28,200
Then Mr. Dougle came and took him.

932
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:30,360
Then..

933
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:33,880
In this way D committed
his first murder.

934
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,160
To give your response tweet..

935
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:41,680
..

936
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:45,560
Who is he?

937
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:56,320
Find out Girdhari.
- Okay.

938
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:58,160
I will not spare him.

939
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:00,320
Be careful brother.
Your BP will shoot.

940
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,920
Find out. Find out..

941
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,040
Okay.

942
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:06,480
Brother that..

943
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:09,680
What?

944
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,400
There are two more videos.

945
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:27,560
Why are you laughing?

946
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:29,520
Because you were laughing brother.

947
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,360
Hello..
- Hello.

948
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:49,520
Before doing the daring you
should have thought about the dangers.

949
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:50,600
Who is speaking?

950
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:52,320
Since three days you
have created a chaos on..

951
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,920
..twitter and you do
not know who I am speaking.

952
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:55,760
D.

953
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:58,200
Will D personally call you?

954
00:51:58,280 --> 00:51:59,160
So who is speaking?

955
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:01,480
It is not important who I am speaking.

956
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:06,040
It is important that
you stop your drama.

957
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:10,000
Otherwise we will not
take much time to finish you.

958
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:11,640
This drama will not stop.

959
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:13,480
India is a free country
and we have the..

960
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:15,080
..right to speak and
show anything we wish to.

961
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:16,800
Hey, free country.

962
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:19,120
Keep a finger on the globe.

963
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:22,480
Every country is there
but none is free for us.

964
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:25,360
Whatever you are showing
is false so stop it.

965
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:26,640
What is wrong in that?

966
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:28,800
If you believe vegetable seller
and constable then everything is true.

967
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:32,040
Understand that you
and your actors will die.

968
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:34,400
You do not understand.
This drama will not end.

969
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:37,440
Kill me if you wish to.

970
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:39,400
What will you achieve by killing me.

971
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:44,680
Look, if one incident happens on social
media then its impact is for long.

972
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Your brother is going
to be insulted for sure.

973
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:49,440
Yes, there is one option.

974
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:52,280
Quiet. Are you playing KBC with me?

975
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:54,840
Ask brother to give
me personal interview.

976
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:57,280
Whatever he wishes to
justify say in that interview.

977
00:52:57,360 --> 00:53:00,240
I take the responsibility
of telecasting that interview.

978
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:00,920
Okay..

979
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:04,080
Hey you rascal..

980
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:05,800
Don't curse me but do me this favor.

981
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:10,400
Now call me next time only when
brother agrees for interview. Okay.

982
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:11,680
Hey hello..

983
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:32,000
So he has created all
this chaos for the interview.

984
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:33,120
Yes brother.

985
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:36,680
Say yes.

986
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:38,880
What are you saying?

987
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,400
Say yes to him.
How?

988
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:45,320
It is an opportunity Girdhari.
Enough of playing jokes.

989
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:49,640
Those who were scared till
yesterday are laughing today.

990
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:59,160
Everyone should know
that D means fear.

991
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:02,200
That means D you will
give interview and come on TV.

992
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:04,520
Bringing him here
would create trouble.

993
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:06,160
There is a security risk.

994
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:08,680
There is no security risk Girdhari.

995
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:13,400
He has just to be brought here.

996
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:15,040
What do you mean?

997
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:19,800
I mean you say yes
to him for the interview..

998
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:24,760
..and I will kill him live on TV.

999
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:39,280
Hello..

1000
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:42,120

3:30 at Bhendi Bazaar.

1001
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:43,120
Come alone.

1002
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:45,000
Who is speaking?

1003
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:47,760
If you need interview
then reach there.

1004
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:50,760
Tindi Bazaar..

1005
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:52,040
Aloo Bazaar..

1006
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:53,840
Bhendi Bazaar. Can't you hear?

1007
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:56,440
Okay, Bhendi Bazaar.
But where in Bhendi Bazaar?

1008
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:59,000
Ask for 100gms cardamom
at Simar general store.

1009
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:00,040
200gms.

1010
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:02,760
100gms cardamom.
- Okay.

1011
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:04,520
Bhendi Bazaar. Right.

1012
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:06,400
Yes, Bhendi Bazaar.
- Okay.

1013
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:23,040
Roy, my boy we are in cardamom!

1014
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:25,800
I mean we are in business.

1015
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:27,600
Yes.

1016
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:52,800
I hope you had no problem
in understanding the route. - No..

1017
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:55,200
Look at this cardamom.

1018
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:57,240
I had called for it.

1019
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:59,040
It was finished at home.

1020
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:01,000
It will be of use
to make rice pudding.

1021
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:04,320
You just have to take 4 people there.

1022
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:05,760
Tell me before hand.

1023
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:07,520
Take this.
- What is this?

1024
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:12,240
These are your tickets. Do
not open them before reaching there.

1025
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:14,800
You must have understood
that Haftaa brother has sent this.

1026
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:16,200
But how will we go?

1027
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:19,440
There is a Bahid village
near Bikaner in Rajasthan.

1028
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:22,920
Reach there at 4 in the afternoon
there day after tomorrow.

1029
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:26,320
Near kali Mata Chowk
you will find a tea stall.

1030
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:29,480
Order for Udta Chicken
and Bullet Chaat.

1031
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:31,920
Brother, give me 4 Udta Chicken chaat.

1032
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:33,520
Coffee With D

1033
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:41,240
If you want to live
then drink coffee with D

1034
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:48,520
If you want to live
then drink coffee with D

1035
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:05,360
Brother we got message
of Hafta brother.

1036
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:07,160
The boys are right.

1037
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:10,080
Won't you blindfold us
so that we cannot see the way?

1038
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:12,040
There is no problem if you see..

1039
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:13,880
..because you will not
be able to see while returning.

1040
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:14,680
Why?

1041
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:16,720
Because while returning
you will be in chicken bag.

1042
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:19,560
Coffee With D.

1043
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:33,160
Okay, who is Arnab?

1044
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:35,560
Okay, okay.

1045
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:39,360
Hey, what are you selling nowadays,
vegetable seller?

1046
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:42,120
I don't have a shop.
I am a makeup man sir.

1047
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:43,480
Okay, keep quiet vegetable seller.

1048
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:45,640
Hey madam, no photo.
- Why?

1049
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:46,600
Keep your mobile inside.

1050
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:50,160
No photo.
- Sorry.

1051
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:51,920
You seemed to be very brave
on the phone the other day.

1052
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,800
I felt as if you would
kill me there and then.

1053
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:55,920
Today you seemed to be tensed.

1054
00:57:56,600 --> 00:58:00,000
I had to reach you otherwise I
am worth nothing in front of you all.

1055
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:00,840
What do you mean?

1056
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:04,440
I mean will D sir
meet us now or later?

1057
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:05,760
He will meet you later.

1058
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:07,720
Is she your wife?

Is she your sister?
- No.

1060
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,920
I am Girdhari.

1061
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:18,080
Either shake hands or give me the bag.

1062
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:20,840
Hello.

1063
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:22,200

I do not know anything.

1068
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:41,080
I am saying truth.
- Egg and bread.

1069
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:42,640
I don't want.

1070
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:47,520
Come on I am too angry now. Come on..

Come on make the video quickly.

1073
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:53,000
Straighten your hand.
- It is straight.

00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:54,920
Come on quickly.
- Keep the focus here.

1075
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,040
Yes keep the focus there.
- Sorry madam..

1076
00:58:57,320 --> 00:59:00,560
Hey Bhansali, will you
make a three and half hour movie?

1077
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:02,320
Make a small love story.

1078
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:03,440
Done..

1079
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:05,320

Come on move...

1081
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:07,440
Not that side but come this side.

1082
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:10,400
Ask her to pick up.

1083
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:12,480
Come on get inside.
- Come on.

1084
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:15,000
Come on.
- be careful of knife.

1085
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:24,640
Hello.

1086
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:27,800
You should have been
director in CBI Mr. Roy.

1087
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,000
Who is this?

1088
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:31,160
I am director of CBI speaking fool.

1089
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:34,120
Is there some legal matter that
you have sent your people to Pakistan?

1090
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:36,920
Sorry sir. I made a mistake.

1091
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:39,920
I was about to call
you and then I realized..

1092
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,440
..that you will talk that nonsense.

1093
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:44,760
Get the phone of D tapped.

1094
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,520
Or send some of his internal photos.

1095
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:49,800
Or give him posion.

1096
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:52,560
My boy would have got
distracted from his work, sir.

1097
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:55,240
You do not know what
foolishness have you done.

1098
00:59:55,480 --> 01:00:00,760
Sir if we do the work that you cannot
do then it is called foolishness.

1099
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:01,840
This is wrong, sir.

1100
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:04,040
You idiot.
Do you know what you have done?

1101
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:05,520
Because of this..
- I am sorry sir.

1102
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:07,240
I will have to keep the phone.
There is lots of work here.

1103
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:09,600
Sir we will talk
at ease some other time.

1104
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:11,840
Why don't you do one thing?
Come to our studio.

1105
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:13,320
We will take your interview as well.
- What..

1106
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:15,360
Okay sir.
- Idiot.

1107
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:19,480
I know that you are scared.

1108
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:22,680
Anyways there is nothing
to be scared of as..

1109
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:25,040
I do not unnecessarily
raise hand on someone.

1110
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:28,120
Hey, can't you see it is a carpet.

1111
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:30,160
How dare you bring dirty shoes inside?

1112
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:34,560
Hey, I think you do
not know whose men are we.

1113
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:38,560
Idiot, you are the men of that person
who sells cardamom in Bhendi bazaar.

1114
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:42,040
And my husband has personally gone
to meet the person for whom he works.

1115
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:43,840
Now you see what is your standing?

1116
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:47,120
Keep the shoes away and sit down.
- Okay.

1117
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:48,480
I am saying that..

1118
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:50,640
First remove your shoes.
- Remove them, remove them..

1119
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:52,440
Okay, okay..

1120
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:59,120
Hey beautiful,
you are taking us too lightly.

1121
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:01,160
Do you know what is this?
- It is a shoe.

1122
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:08,120
Brother, gun.
Since long we were playing with knife.

1123
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:13,440
Keep it straight.
- Do you know this is real gun?

1124
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,920
Keep it on the side
otherwise you may shoot.

1125
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:18,920
Why?

1126
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:21,600
If you shoot then
this bulb will burst.

1127
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:25,000
And if I shoot then God forbid even
I don't know what will happen of you.

1128
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:30,000
I think I will have to
take permission to kill you.

1129
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:34,520
Is it correct?
- It is correct.

1130
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:36,800
Hello.
- Tell me.

1131
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:39,160
What kind of female is she?

1132
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:42,120
She is saying that she
will kill me with my gun.

1133
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:43,720
Make her understand who I am?

1134
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:44,880
Who I am?

1135
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,680
Who I am?

1136
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:47,800
Who I am?

1137
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:49,080
Tell me who I am?

1138
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:52,880
Don't mess up. You just have
to keep a watch and nothing else.

1139
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:56,280
Okay, good that we talked to you.

1140
01:01:56,360 --> 01:02:00,040
Otherwise you know that
if would have got angry..

1141
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:03,040
..this woman must have died by now.

1142
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:05,720
Surely.
- Ameen.

1143
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:10,320
Forget it. You cannot kill a
mosquito and you are talking so great.

1144
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:12,760
Just keep a watch quietly
and for god sake..

1145
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:14,560
..don't get insulted anymore.
- He is praising me.

1146
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:16,000
Keep quiet.

1147
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:19,080
Brother, listen to me.
- I don't want to hear anything.

1148
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:21,320
Hey Afshaab.
-Yes.

1149
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:24,200
Make them understand.
They are creating too much problem.

1150
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:26,440
They do not know basic hygiene.

1151
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:29,040
He came with dirty
shoes on the carpet.

1152
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:31,520
And the other one has
spread the smell of tobacco..

1153
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:33,320
..which he is chewing continuously.

1154
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:35,600
He eats a lot of tobacco.

1155
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:37,240
So make him understand.

1156
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:41,600
Is this the way to behave
in the house of sophisticated people?

1157
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:46,360
One thing more. Tell then
not do any drama in front of me.

1158
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:49,000
I know they have just
come to keep a watch.

1159
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:53,520
They have no orders to do anything
nor do they have that status.

1160
01:02:56,720 --> 01:03:00,360
Everyone knows Crime
Patrol Episode 591 Season 2

1161
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:02,160
Watch it on you tube.
I shall keep the phone.

1162
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:03,680
Take it.

1163
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:06,000
She sees crime patrol.
- okay, come on.

1164
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:16,600
I beg of you. Please..

1165
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:21,600
It is matter of my dignity.
Please get scared a bit.

1166
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:23,320
Let me make a video, please.

1167
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:25,000
What is there?

1168
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:27,040
Shall I say something?

1169
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:30,600
Is it done?
Video..

1170
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:32,800
Okay do.

1171
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:34,560
Get scared a bit.

1172
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:36,480
Arnab I am feeling very scared.

1173
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:39,240
Arnab, they have kidnapped me.
Please save me Arnab.

1174
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:41,520
Please I am very scared.

1175
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:49,240
Arnab, they are holding my hand.
Please save me.

1176
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:54,680
Leave me.

1177
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:58,040
Enough.
- Get lost. Enough of it.

1178
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:06,120
Brother has made a nice house.

1179
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:08,160
The place where you are standing..

1180
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:09,720
Is there a bomb there?
- No, no..

1181
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:12,880
Those are Italian tiles. Imported.

1182
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:16,680
Is it good?
- Nice.

1183
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:18,840
Can you see that?

1184
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:22,160
Brother cut the hand
of the person who made it.

1185
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:24,520
Why?

1186
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:27,440
A masterpiece remains a
masterpiece only when one is made.

1187
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:29,360
Like Shah Jahan.
- Yes.

1188
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:32,440
Till when will sir do interview?

1189
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:33,120
Interview?

1190
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:35,320
Eat something and then
we will do interview.

1191
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:36,880
What will you have vegetarian
or non vegetarian food.

1192
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:37,760
Nothing..

1193
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:39,240
Eat something.

1194
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:40,520
We had chicken on the way.

1195
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:41,760
Okay.

1196
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:47,760
We have a tradition that
before killing the goat we feed him.

1197
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:49,920
Food.

1198
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:54,480
How did you like the house?
- Nice.

1199
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:56,120
Is it nice?

1200
01:04:56,920 --> 01:05:00,160
The house in which you live
in Mumbai is rented or your own.

1201
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:01,040
It is on EMI

1202
01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:03,760
That house is also nice.

1203
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:05,320
Curtains are also nice.

1204
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:09,160
Sister-in-law is also beautiful.

1205
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:13,720
You are very fond of making
comedy videos and showing them.

1206
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:16,800
Watch a thriller now.
- Arnab, he is holding my hand.

1207
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:18,360
Please save me..

1208
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:21,080
Don't do this. What are you doing?

1209
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:21,920
Leave me.

1210
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,760
Nothing will happen. Don't worry
nothing will happen to sister-in-law.

1211
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:26,560
This is just a teaser.

1212
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:29,000
This is for the simple
reason that you do not..

1213
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:31,560
..misbehave while taking
interview with brother.

1214
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:36,400
Otherwise we will get sequel 1,
2, 3 of it.

1215
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:40,280
Nothing will happen to her.
This is just for reference.

1216
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:43,000
Where is he?

1217
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:45,920
Rumy. There he is.

1218
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:47,760
Okay..
- Where is..

1219
01:05:48,120 --> 01:05:49,760
Bathroom. This side.

1220
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:54,760
Come, will you have tea?

1221
01:05:54,840 --> 01:05:56,560
Yes, I am very fond of tea.

1222
01:05:56,640 --> 01:05:59,480
Make me drink nice tea.
- Tanveer, get tasty tea.

1223
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:02,600
And how am I looking?

1224
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:03,840
You are looking very nice.

1225
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:06,600
Do little bit of what you do.
- Makeup.

1226
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:07,360
Yes.

1227
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:10,360
So will you also go
on air for the interview?

1228
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:11,720
On air.

1229
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:13,880
That means brother
will go on air as well.

1230
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:16,600
No, through satellite direct on TV.

1231
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:19,880
Yes, yes I will come.
Call that cameraman.

1232
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,640
Choosy, come here.

1233
01:06:22,320 --> 01:06:23,480
Yes tell me.
- Come here.

1234
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:25,000
Am I looking okay?
- Nice, absolutely nice.

1235
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:26,200
Come this side.

1236
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:30,360
I am cracking jokes
so shoot that in camera.

1237
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:32,000
Record.
- Yes.

1238
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:33,200
Shall I speak?

1239
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:34,320
Yes speak.

1240
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:35,680
There was a man..

1241
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:39,200
..who was taking his
newlywed wife on a horse cart.

1242
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:40,360
Okay.
- Yes.

1243
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:43,480
A stone came under
the foot of the horse..

1244
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:46,280
..and he shook with jerk.

1245
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:48,120
The wife also got jerk.

1246
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:50,160
The man said one.
- Yes.

1247
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:52,720
After some time the
horse again got a jerk.

1248
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:56,160
The wife shook and the man said two.
- Two.

1249
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:58,920
They went a little ahead.
The same stone and jerk.

1250
01:06:59,040 --> 01:07:02,560
The man took out the
gun and shot at the horse.

1251
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:06,600
The wife shouted that
how merciless you are.

1252
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:08,840
Does anyone kill an
innocent animal in this way?

1253
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:10,240
The man said one.

1254
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:13,760
How was it?

1255
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:15,800
Nice, nice..
- Then laugh.

1256
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:18,200
Nice..
- Now show how it has come.

1257
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:20,120
Look brother.

1258
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:23,080
It has come nice.
Nice. Now do that to it.

1259
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:25,080
Delete..
- No..

1260
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:26,400
Photohop..

1261
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:27,680
Upload.

1262
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:29,920
What do you do as you
did of brother's video?

1263
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,600
Okay, upload it on facebook.
- Yes.

1264
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:34,920
Yes, do that.
- Okay upload it on facebook.

1265
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,400
Make an infection of it.

1266
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:39,480
It is not a viral or mosquito
that I make infection of it.

1267
01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:41,760
How did you spread
the video of brother?

1268
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:43,000
Okay Viral..

1269
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:44,880
Yes, that.. now make it viral..

1270
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,120
Yes..
- Okay we will do it.

1271
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:49,560
Neha.

1272
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:52,200
I just cracked a joke so listen to it.

1273
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:54,160
Thanks but no thanks.

1274
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:56,720
It is nice and you will enjoy it.

1275
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:59,240
No, I don't listen much to jokes.

1276
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:00,720
Then shall I narrate
something serious?

1277
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:03,080
I am okay. Thanks.

1278
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:06,880
I swear it is very hot.

1279
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:08,080
What?

1280
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:09,200
Tea.

1281
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:10,400
Isn't it?
Yes it is hot.

1282
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:13,320
Please have tea.
- No, I am okay.

1283
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:14,520
Really, thank you.

1284
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:16,600
Come on Rumy, going to be on air.

1285
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:18,160
Come on.
I am giving you with love.

1286
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:19,320
Okay please...

1287
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:20,320
Please take it.

1288
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:21,160
No thanks.
- Come on.

1289
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:38,680
"Tell me what should I do?"

1290
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:42,840
"At the back is fear and
death is standing in front."

1291
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:46,000
"Tell me what should I do?"

1292
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:49,880
"At the back is fear and
death is standing in front."

1293
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,760
Hey Sarwa, just because
of an interview with hooligan..

1294
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:55,560
..the entire society
has become chaotic.

1295
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:57,480
Sarwa, he is sitting in Karachi..

1296
01:08:57,560 --> 01:09:01,480
..and here in Mumbai because
of his name he has created confusion.

1297
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:02,920
Look, how people are running.

1298
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:06,480
Hey, don't call him a hooligan.
Call him Don.

1299
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:07,800
Call him Don.

1300
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:13,440
"If you have the courage
to live then drink Coffee With D."

1301
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:20,200
"If you have the courage
to live then drink Coffee With D."

1302
01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:23,880
"Coffee With D."

1303
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:27,280
"Coffee With D."
- You are getting nervous..

1304
01:09:27,360 --> 01:09:29,720
..and you are making me nervous too.
- Just finish this.

1305
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:30,920
Okay, okay..

1306
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:32,680
Okay.
- Yeah.

1307
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:34,680
Okay, let us start.
- Okay.

1308
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:35,720
Yeah.

1309
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:40,400
Ready 3, 2..

1310
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:42,640
One minute..

1311
01:09:42,840 --> 01:09:47,280
Mr. Girdhari, ask brother to
change the shirt. What is he wearing?

1312
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:49,280
It will create so
much jitter on camera.

1313
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:50,320
What? Who will kill?

1314
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:51,880
No, no one minute..

1315
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,440
Will you kill brother?
- No, no..

1316
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:54,320
He said jitter.

1317
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:56,000
It is hot outside so
he is becoming irritable.

1318
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:57,360
Has glitter come to kill him?

1319
01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:00,800
Shirt is absolutely fine.
- Okay.

1320
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:01,680
Please sit down.

1321
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:05,400
Quiet.
- What sir?

1322
01:10:05,480 --> 01:10:06,160
Okay.

1323
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:11,120
Alright going live. 3. 2, 1..

1324
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:19,400
Welcome and good evening
to One On One with me Arnab Ghosh.

1325
01:10:19,480 --> 01:10:21,880
Today's interview is
special for two reasons.

1326
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:25,920
One, the person whom I am
going to interview is camera shy.

1327
01:10:26,040 --> 01:10:28,760
He has not given interview
to anyone despite the fact..

1328
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,840
..that he has done such
works that the world's police..

1329
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:35,520
I mean media wants to interview him.

1330
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:37,600
Secondly it is my birthday..

1331
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:40,520
..so it might be the
last interview of my life.

1332
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:44,120
Jokes apart.

1333
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:46,840
I like to introduce you to the man..

1334
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:50,800
..the myth and the most
wanted outlaw of the world D.

1335
01:10:55,560 --> 01:10:58,760
So I am giving you interview at last.

1336
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:01,560
At least one of your ill
feelings are taken care of.

1337
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:03,800
Today you are not giving
interview but I am taking it.

1338
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:28,840
Come on let's start again.

1339
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:31,160
Greetings Mr. D.

1340
01:11:32,240 --> 01:11:33,400
Greetings.

1341
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:37,160
Brother..
- Where, where..

1342
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:37,920
On TV.

1343
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:42,360
Brother, brother.. worry not.

1344
01:11:42,440 --> 01:11:44,920
I will not spare her. Hey.

1345
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,480
Brother.

1346
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:54,520
Doesn't your channel have
any news to show other than me?

1347
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:57,600
We have. But you do such big things.

1348
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,440
You must have seen those videos.
- I have seen..

1349
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:04,120
..and recognize some of the actors.

1350
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:10,240
What are you saying Mr. D? Those
are the real videos of real people.

1351
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:12,720
Don't call me Mr. but brother.
It brings us closer.

1352
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:15,560
By addressing me Mr.
I get the feel of enmity.

1353
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:18,240
Anyway your stories are
like drugs to the Indians.

1354
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:19,280
We can't help it.

1355
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:23,520
So you mean I should give drug as
well as entertainment brother Arnab.

1356
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:24,800
Call me Mr. Arnab.

1357
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:26,840
By calling me brother
I get the feel of hooligan.

1358
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:31,200
And it is not entertainment.
It is called news.

1359
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:33,360
Okay.

1360
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:35,880
Brother Girdhari.

1361
01:12:36,040 --> 01:12:37,640
Girdhari, did I hear it correctly?

1362
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:39,080
Yes, Girdhari.

1363
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:45,920
Lovingly I call him Girdhari
Secular and he is my main associate.

1364
01:12:46,160 --> 01:12:51,400
In your language he is CEO,
my main man.

1365
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:53,560
And she is my main lady.

1366
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:58,400
But Girdhari..
I am surprised that your CEO is a..

1367
01:13:00,760 --> 01:13:02,160
Don't go to that side..

1368
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:04,760
..otherwise the interview
will become like that..

1369
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:06,200
What do you mean? How will it be?

1370
01:13:06,280 --> 01:13:08,640
Like a nonsense political rally.

1371
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:13,160
As you wish otherwise honestly
I am interested in going there.

1372
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:17,200
Girdhari...
- Yes, brother.

1373
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:21,880
What news did last week come
about me on their news channel?

1374
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,720
Breaking news.

1375
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:29,800
Brother they had said that for..

1376
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:34,640
..you have come to Bangkok because
Pakistan does not have this facility.

1377
01:13:34,840 --> 01:13:36,000
Yes.

1378
01:13:36,440 --> 01:13:39,720
Yes. Now tell me brother
Arnab is this right?

1379
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:44,000
For last three months I
have not moved from this place.

1380
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:46,200
There is nothing great in this.

1381
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:48,840
That day Pakistan
bashing was necessary.

1382
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:52,040
Population control guys
wanted to run a story for them.

1383
01:13:52,120 --> 01:13:55,680
And more rumors of you being
in Pakistan or not continue.

1384
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:58,560
Yes so. I did not understand anything.

1385
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:01,160
We had fewer slots.

1386
01:14:01,240 --> 01:14:03,840
So chief editor covered
three stories in single news.

1387
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:05,520
You must have heard the headlines.

1388
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:09,280
No facility in Pakistan..D
had to go to Bangkok.

1389
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:10,400
What's wrong with that?

1390
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,400
You should have called
the chief editor as well.

1391
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:25,560
Brother, may I ask you a question?
- Yes.

1392
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:28,680
I hope you will let
me go alive from here.

1393
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:29,920
Do you have any doubt?

1394
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,720
I am sure that you will
not do anything like that.

1395
01:14:33,160 --> 01:14:34,440
What will I not do?

1396
01:14:34,520 --> 01:14:35,880
Cheap hooligan acts.

1397
01:14:43,560 --> 01:14:46,080
Brother, firstly I would
like to ask you that..

1398
01:14:46,160 --> 01:14:48,480
..how did you become
such a big gangster?

1399
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:51,080
You have said it once
so dare not say it again.

1400
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,760
I am not gangster..

1401
01:14:56,360 --> 01:14:57,560
..but a Don.

1402
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:01,120
What did you understand?
- Okay, what is the difference?

1403
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:04,360
Have you ever seen shootout on roads?

1404
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:06,320
Not really but have heard from police.

1405
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:10,200
Those involved in
shootout are gangsters.

1406
01:15:10,280 --> 01:15:11,360
And don?

1407
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:16,480
Have you ever heard about the
mastermind behind these shootouts?

1408
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:18,160
Not really. Have heard rumors.

1409
01:15:18,240 --> 01:15:24,360
So Don is the mastermind
about whom you have heard rumors.

1410
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:28,240
So basically how did you become Don?

1411
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:37,160
Any problem sir.
- No problem.

1412
01:15:37,680 --> 01:15:40,640
Actually I had a desire
of doing business from childhood.

1413
01:15:40,920 --> 01:15:42,680
But business can be of any kind.

1414
01:15:42,760 --> 01:15:45,680
Construction, production,
transportation, real estate etc.

1415
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:48,640
So what do you think all
these are not my businesses?

1416
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:50,600
Let's not get involved in what I feel.

1417
01:15:50,680 --> 01:15:52,840
Otherwise this interview
will have pre mature climax.

1418
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:54,560
Where did you begin from?

1419
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:57,520
Actually I was multi
talented from childhood.

1420
01:15:57,920 --> 01:16:01,520
What is the called? All rounder.

1421
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:05,040
But my father had problem with this.

1422
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:07,200
So you mean to say that
the reason you became a Don..

1423
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:09,840
..are the unresolved father issues.

1424
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:12,000
What?

1425
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:16,040
Only one person is responsible..

1426
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:20,640
..for me to become Don and that is I.

1427
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:23,800
What did you understand?
- You are right.

1428
01:16:24,040 --> 01:16:26,040
What a stupid question on my part?

1429
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:29,040
Which father would want his
son to become a Don after growing up?

1430
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:30,920
Even you are right?

1431
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:35,040
Which channel would want
his best reporter to die untimely?

1432
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:43,680
Let's come to your question?

1433
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:48,200
Actually I loved
cricket from childhood.

1434
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:51,840
I was short height with
heavy body so could not play.

1435
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:56,560
But my instincts were very strong.

1436
01:16:57,360 --> 01:17:02,600
In your language 'Mann Ki Baat'

1437
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:07,440
So from childhood you got
involved in match fixing and betting.

1438
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:21,200
I said four it was four.

1439
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:23,680
I said six it was a six.

1440
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:27,160
I said out it was out.

1441
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:30,880
So basically you want to say
that your gut feeling was very strong.

1442
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:32,360
Yes, in the beginning.

1443
01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:35,080
Afterwards there
was no need of gut feel.

1444
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:37,400
Sorry, I did not understand.

1445
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:40,280
Ask something else.
Ask something interesting.

1446
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:44,200
So you are saying that you
have nothing to do with match fixing.

1447
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:47,720
The entire world knows this D.
you cannot deny this.

1448
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:50,120
Your photographs
are seen in the stadium.

1449
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:51,480
How can you say this?

1450
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:53,240
Photo.
- Yes.

1451
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:56,280
Photographs are seen
of film stars on grant road..

1452
01:17:56,360 --> 01:17:58,560
..so that means all
of them are prostitutes.

1453
01:17:59,480 --> 01:18:02,400
Photo of politicians is also
there in from Amar Jawan Jyoti..

1454
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:03,480
..so all of them are patriots.

1455
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:04,640
What are you talking, brother Arnab?

1456
01:18:04,720 --> 01:18:07,080
So where did all rumors come from?

1457
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:10,880
Actually I had friendship
with few players.

1458
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:14,360
Some had difficulty in
affording two girlfriends.

1459
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:16,280
Some had to repay education loan.

1460
01:18:16,360 --> 01:18:18,200
I use to help them.

1461
01:18:18,280 --> 01:18:20,360
Oh I see and in return.

1462
01:18:20,680 --> 01:18:23,280
In return they used to help me.
What else?

1463
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:25,040
Now..

1464
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:29,360
If every batsman will
make 100 in every match then..

1465
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:32,320
..how will rest of
the talent get a chance?

1466
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:35,880
Growth should be inclusive.

1467
01:18:36,160 --> 01:18:39,040
That means whatever
we saw on TV screens..

1468
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:41,000
..was actually remote
controlled by you.

1469
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:44,200
Hey, you are unnecessarily
exaggerating things.

1470
01:18:46,720 --> 01:18:48,720
So many times..

1471
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:55,320
..I have told the players
to make 100 in a match.

1472
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:57,520
For which country?
- My country.

1473
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:01,000
What do you mean by my country?
- My country means my country.

1474
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:03,440
That's all very fine
but why don't you take a name?

1475
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:06,640
What is there in a name,
brother Arnab?

1476
01:19:06,720 --> 01:19:09,560
A country is not made
by name but with people.

1477
01:19:09,640 --> 01:19:11,040
What did you understand?
- Okay.

1478
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:13,120
So you were talking
about your talents.

1479
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:14,200
Yes.

1480
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:16,720
Other than cricket
I loved movies also.

1481
01:19:18,760 --> 01:19:21,520
But I had two weaknesses
with regard to movies.

1482
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,920
One I cannot wait till the
movie is released in cinema halls.

1483
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:28,160
Secondly..

1484
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:32,080
..I cannot enjoy movie alone.

1485
01:19:32,160 --> 01:19:35,040
If the movie is nice it
should reach everyone. Isn't it?

1486
01:19:35,320 --> 01:19:38,400
Okay, so that is
why you started piracy.

1487
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:40,440
Piracy?

1488
01:19:40,760 --> 01:19:42,440
What does that mean, Girdhari?

1489
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:48,280
I used to travel the world.

1490
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:52,400
Wherever I saw a nice movie
I used to make one copy of it.

1491
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:54,840
Did you understand? - So
this according to you is not piracy.

1492
01:19:54,920 --> 01:20:00,560
Not forcefully, Arnab but with love.

1493
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:02,880
Sometimes France and sometimes Cannes.

1494
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,280
France and Cannes are the same Mr. D.

1495
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:08,000
You understood it so
why are you going in detail.

1496
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:11,080
So basically you picked
up a print from festivals.

1497
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:14,520
Picked up?

1498
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,800
Men are kidnapped.

1499
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:20,560
Have you ever heard
that the film was kidnapped?

1500
01:20:21,200 --> 01:20:22,480
No, Have you heard?

1501
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:24,120
A question to your passion for movies.

1502
01:20:24,280 --> 01:20:26,400
Do you invest in Bollywood?
- No.

1503
01:20:26,680 --> 01:20:28,560
A lot of people believe that you do.

1504
01:20:28,640 --> 01:20:32,160
And you have a huge
piracy racket that causes..

1505
01:20:32,240 --> 01:20:35,560
..losses worth crores
to film industry every year.

1506
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:37,120
Which losses?

1507
01:20:38,240 --> 01:20:39,680
Which losses?

1508
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,560
First tell me where is my money?

1509
01:20:42,640 --> 01:20:44,040
Which money of yours?

1510
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:48,800
The money that I should get
on every film that is based on me.

1511
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:50,240
Should I get it or not?

1512
01:20:50,440 --> 01:20:52,600
Intellectual property.

1513
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:57,000
I am sure everyone wants
to know what your real business is.

1514
01:20:57,040 --> 01:21:00,720
Smuggling,
extortion, horse racing or what..

1515
01:21:00,920 --> 01:21:02,280
Nothing out of this.

1516
01:21:03,320 --> 01:21:05,560
Basically you are unemployed.

1517
01:21:06,040 --> 01:21:07,680
Shall I ask you
something brother Arnab?

1518
01:21:09,320 --> 01:21:13,680
Begal family in America,
Gonzalis family in South America..

1519
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:16,040
..and there are so
many names in Italy.

1520
01:21:16,120 --> 01:21:17,840
You will keep counting till evening.

1521
01:21:18,280 --> 01:21:21,640
All these people work
according to their wish.

1522
01:21:23,160 --> 01:21:24,720
Why do you have..

1523
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:27,840
..special interest in me?

1524
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:31,560
What special have they done
that no one says anything to them.

1525
01:21:31,640 --> 01:21:33,480
Mr. D you are evading my question.

1526
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:35,560
Are you saying that
you don't do smuggling?

1527
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:39,400
Hey buddy, I am service provider.

1528
01:21:39,560 --> 01:21:41,360
Service provider.

1529
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:47,320
Transport service,
courier service, mobile service..

1530
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:49,080
From mobile service
I remember one thing.

1531
01:21:50,120 --> 01:21:54,200
Tell me one thing if a person
calls from an airtel number..

1532
01:21:54,280 --> 01:21:57,560
..and do kidnapping then
what is the fault of airtel.

1533
01:21:57,640 --> 01:22:00,920
You said courier service. So
that means are you dominoes of drugs.

1534
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:05,000
Your question has two words
which I did not understand.

1535
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:05,760
Okay.

1536
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:08,040
If you are a service provider..

1537
01:22:08,120 --> 01:22:11,200
..then why don't you openly
do business just like others?

1538
01:22:11,720 --> 01:22:13,560
I work openly.

1539
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:17,760
You tell me how much material
you want me to send to your house.

1540
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:21,600
I never meant that.

1541
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:25,640
Leave it.

1542
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:28,040
What about extortion?

1543
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:29,680
I swear upon God..

1544
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:32,440
..till today I have not
got anyone's child aborted.

1545
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:36,040
Mr. D I am not talking
about abortion but of extortion.

1546
01:22:36,120 --> 01:22:39,720
Okay, what is the meaning of this?
I do not know its meaning.

1547
01:22:39,800 --> 01:22:43,000
Actor..he understands
intellectual property..

1548
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:44,920
..but does not understand extortion.

1549
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:48,560
Extortion means to obtain
money through force or threat.

1550
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:49,920
Amazing.

1551
01:22:50,680 --> 01:22:53,680
Why do people come to
the point of force and threat?

1552
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:55,120
What is my fault in this?

1553
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:58,240
So you do agree that
you extract money from people.

1554
01:22:58,320 --> 01:23:01,480
If I provide service then
will surely give the bill.

1555
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:05,040
Do you take salary from
the channel to do this show?

1556
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:09,240
Okay Mr. D I think you are
not in mood to give direct answers.

1557
01:23:09,320 --> 01:23:11,360
Let's shift to some lighter questions.

1558
01:23:12,640 --> 01:23:16,000
You have already shifted
from brother to Mr. D

1559
01:23:16,040 --> 01:23:19,600
Even you have shifted from Mr.
Arnab to brother Arnab.

1560
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:26,720
Who is your favorite actor?

1561
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:29,200
Bruce Wills and Sylvester Stallone.

1562
01:23:29,480 --> 01:23:30,880
So you see Hollywood as well.

1563
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:32,200
I see only Hollywood.

1564
01:23:32,280 --> 01:23:34,480
That is strange but why not Bollywood.

1565
01:23:34,640 --> 01:23:36,480
I don't like movies from South and..

1566
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:38,800
..you do not make
anything else except that.

1567
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:41,040
Who is your favorite heroine?

1568
01:23:41,080 --> 01:23:42,840
No one is nice in your country.

1569
01:23:42,920 --> 01:23:45,640
Some have fake lips,
some do not know Hindi..

1570
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:47,240
..and if you see someone
without make up..

1571
01:23:47,320 --> 01:23:48,800
..then you would get paralysis attack.

1572
01:23:50,280 --> 01:23:52,200
Where do you get all these from?

1573
01:23:52,360 --> 01:23:54,880
Okay, so who do you like?

1574
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,640
Nazreena..
- But she is from Bollywood.

1575
01:23:57,800 --> 01:24:02,520
She is in Bollywood now. Her
actual work started in New York's bar.

1576
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:05,040
Mr. D this is a family show..

1577
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:08,280
..so it would be better if
you keep your responses censored.

1578
01:24:08,360 --> 01:24:11,360
If you were to do family show
then why are you interviewing me?

1579
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:14,000
You should have done of
Sooraj Barjatya or Raju Hirani.

1580
01:24:14,040 --> 01:24:17,600
Believe me I tried for that
but they are busier than you nowadays.

1581
01:24:17,680 --> 01:24:19,880
Shall I arrange by calling them now?

1582
01:24:20,200 --> 01:24:24,400
Anyway, other than
Hollywood what do you like?

1583
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:27,920
Other than Hollywood
I like to see porn.

1584
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:33,840
There is no story in this as well
in that but action is surely there.

1585
01:24:34,280 --> 01:24:37,600
But nowadays many such movies
are being made in Bollywood..

1586
01:24:37,680 --> 01:24:39,120
..where there is so much action.

1587
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:43,560
For example Jism 2, Ragini MMS 2
Extreme action.

1588
01:24:43,640 --> 01:24:46,080
So you had to get a porn star.

1589
01:24:48,640 --> 01:24:52,600
Okay, With that we take a short break.
Stay with us we will just be back.

1590
01:24:57,720 --> 01:25:02,440
Special LIV-IN condoms. Made from
Nigeria's special 4N TCM polyster.

1591
01:25:02,520 --> 01:25:04,240
You need not remove it.

1592
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:06,800
You never know when
you would get a chance.

1593
01:25:07,080 --> 01:25:10,800
It adjusts according to your size.

1594
01:25:10,920 --> 01:25:15,760
So that at the time
of need you are ready.

1595
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:20,120
LIV-In condoms. Keep wearing it.

1596
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:21,360
Don't remove it.

1597
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:23,680
Welcome back. I am still with D.

1598
01:25:24,200 --> 01:25:26,360
A man who is not
ready to give answer..

1599
01:25:26,440 --> 01:25:28,720
..but we are trying
to find answers from him.

1600
01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:34,560
Sir, tell me something about
your journey from Mumbai to here.

1601
01:25:36,160 --> 01:25:37,440
Not Mumbai.

1602
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:39,480
Okay, sure.

1603
01:25:39,920 --> 01:25:41,800
That reminds me.

1604
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:43,600
I received a call yesterday that..

1605
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:45,760
..there is no water in
my area for last three days.

1606
01:25:46,240 --> 01:25:48,400
You cannot do such a small work.

1607
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:52,280
Mr. D let me remind you
that I am not in municipality.

1608
01:25:52,360 --> 01:25:54,760
Not that I have remembered
then let me get it done.

1609
01:25:54,840 --> 01:25:56,440
Call up Gaitonde.

1610
01:25:57,600 --> 01:25:59,920
I will just show you
what municipality is.

1611
01:26:04,120 --> 01:26:05,640
Hello..
- Gaitonde...

1612
01:26:05,720 --> 01:26:06,480
Greetings, brother.

1613
01:26:06,680 --> 01:26:07,840
How are you?
- Absolutely fine.

1614
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:08,680
Greetings.

1615
01:26:09,080 --> 01:26:10,800
All that is fine. Listen to me.

1616
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:13,920
There is no water
in Dongri for three days.

1617
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:18,480
Send tanker there quickly
and I will not call again.

1618
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:23,000
Yes brother Arnab, tell me.

1619
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:26,000
Mr. D you have still
not answered my question.

1620
01:26:26,040 --> 01:26:29,120
Tell me about your
journey from...to here.

1621
01:26:29,200 --> 01:26:33,360
Look Dongri brought me up,
waiting room helped me to grow

1622
01:26:33,440 --> 01:26:35,760
Wadala and Manish Market made me Don.

1623
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:38,080
Your government made me fugitive.

1624
01:26:38,160 --> 01:26:40,840
That is all about my journey.

1625
01:26:41,040 --> 01:26:45,000
And how did you reach this place?

1626
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:47,320
Here I have come with my wish.
Ask why?

1627
01:26:47,560 --> 01:26:48,320
Why?

1628
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:51,800
I Karachi I feel the fragrance of....

1629
01:26:51,880 --> 01:26:54,520
Okay now that e are
talking of fragrance then..

1630
01:26:54,600 --> 01:26:57,440
..do you want to say
something about 93 blasts.

1631
01:26:57,520 --> 01:27:00,840
Don't go there otherwise
interview will become like that.

1632
01:27:00,920 --> 01:27:03,040
Mr. D it is my job to go there.

1633
01:27:03,400 --> 01:27:05,760
I am also a service provider like you.

1634
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:06,840
I deliver truth.

1635
01:27:06,920 --> 01:27:10,280
Then go and find truth somewhere else.
There is no truth about this here.

1636
01:27:10,360 --> 01:27:11,520
So you do not want to say anything.

1637
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:13,920
How did the battery
of the remote decreased?

1638
01:27:15,560 --> 01:27:19,560
Brother Arnab,
in childhood my mother had explained..

1639
01:27:19,640 --> 01:27:22,080
..that if someone has
made up his mind then..

1640
01:27:22,160 --> 01:27:25,400
..don't waste time
to make him understand.

1641
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:28,480
Okay so if you won't
tell then let me ask.

1642
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:32,680
Were you involved in 93 blasts?
- No.

1643
01:27:33,320 --> 01:27:34,640
Not a plain no.

1644
01:27:34,720 --> 01:27:36,640
I was not involved so
you want me to give a speech..

1645
01:27:36,720 --> 01:27:38,600
..of three and a half minutes on it.

1646
01:27:38,680 --> 01:27:39,680
What rubbish is this?

1647
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:44,080
It is very clear from the evidences
that you had supplied bombs.

1648
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:46,640
Yes I did.
When did I say that I didn't?

1649
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:48,800
But you just said that
you were not involved.

1650
01:27:49,240 --> 01:27:50,440
Brother..

1651
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:55,080
I supply the bombs
and crackers that burst.

1652
01:27:55,160 --> 01:27:58,480
I have a fireworks factory in....

1653
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:02,800
So you are actually saying that
you own a fireworks factory in India.

1654
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:03,720
Yes.

1655
01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:06,440
If you don't mind can you
tell me the name of that company?

1656
01:28:06,520 --> 01:28:08,040
You are again getting into details.

1657
01:28:08,720 --> 01:28:11,360
What did you say that
is was what of drugs?

1658
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:13,080
Dominoes....
- Dominoes.

1659
01:28:13,160 --> 01:28:17,800
So understand that I am
big bazaar of bombs as well.

1660
01:28:18,600 --> 01:28:22,760
Let us talk about your
occupational hazards.

1661
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:27,920
I mean let's talk about the problems
you face in running your business.

1662
01:28:28,240 --> 01:28:30,760
You must be facing problems
in running the business of bombs.

1663
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,200
Yes, from problem I remember.

1664
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:36,440
Yesterday Al-Qaida people
called and said that..

1665
01:28:36,520 --> 01:28:39,280
..they had sent a suicide
bomb girl in Delhi.

1666
01:28:39,560 --> 01:28:41,720
She was passing through petrol pump..

1667
01:28:41,800 --> 01:28:44,320
..and four boys noticed
and thought she was their right.

1668
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:45,200
And did....

1669
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:50,400
Has it been declared
as official sport in Delhi?

1670
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:54,800
Can you elaborate that
suicide bomber matter?

1671
01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:56,360
Don't deviate from the issue.

1672
01:28:56,800 --> 01:29:03,560
The point is that in your country
a kind girl cannot work peacefully.

1673
01:29:03,640 --> 01:29:05,440
I agree....

1674
01:29:06,760 --> 01:29:11,560
But that so called innocent girl
had not gone there to do candle march.

1675
01:29:12,840 --> 01:29:14,720
Leave it. Let's just move on.

1676
01:29:15,360 --> 01:29:18,160
What other problems do you have?
- Attrition.

1677
01:29:18,240 --> 01:29:20,080
Great. He did not
understand unresolved..

1678
01:29:20,160 --> 01:29:22,480
..father issues but
knows of attrition.

1679
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:25,320
Did you say anything?
- No nothing.

1680
01:29:25,400 --> 01:29:26,320
You carry on.

1681
01:29:26,640 --> 01:29:29,920
In last two months two hundred
people have stopped working for me.

1682
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:33,640
Amazing. I had heard no
one can leave the job of Don.

1683
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:37,720
You heard it right but your Baba..

1684
01:29:39,560 --> 01:29:40,600
..he keeps doing this.

1685
01:29:40,680 --> 01:29:42,640
I had sent to threaten him.

1686
01:29:43,520 --> 01:29:47,240
Three days they stayed in his camp and
said that they don't want to return.

1687
01:29:47,320 --> 01:29:50,600
Seeing them some people
left from there as well.

1688
01:29:50,680 --> 01:29:53,080
What SMS had come, Girdhari?

1689
01:29:53,640 --> 01:29:54,480
Show them.

1690
01:29:55,280 --> 01:29:56,560
Brother, we will not be able to do it.

1691
01:29:56,640 --> 01:29:59,000
Such SMS are coming.

1692
01:29:59,320 --> 01:30:00,000
What should we do?

1693
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:06,280
Absolutely bomb.

1694
01:30:06,680 --> 01:30:08,080
Where?

1695
01:30:10,120 --> 01:30:12,040
Brother, what is her name?

1696
01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:13,800
Absolutely Bomb.

1697
01:30:20,720 --> 01:30:23,280
Where have you got lost?
Ask further, reporter.

1698
01:30:23,640 --> 01:30:25,200
Not reporter but senior editor.

1699
01:30:25,280 --> 01:30:26,600
What is the difference between both?

1700
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:28,920
The same that is there
between gangster and Don.

1701
01:30:30,840 --> 01:30:33,000
On this note let's take a short break.

1702
01:30:33,080 --> 01:30:36,640
I am still sitting with
the most wanted man on the planet.

1703
01:30:36,720 --> 01:30:41,280
And believe me things are going to get
lot more interesting. Don't go away.

1704
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:43,280
Bring water for brother.

1705
01:30:43,680 --> 01:30:45,840
I will just check it.

1706
01:30:48,080 --> 01:30:49,600
I was saying....
- Water...

1707
01:30:51,680 --> 01:30:53,600
I was giving it to her.

1708
01:30:53,680 --> 01:30:55,000
So, I was saying...

1709
01:30:55,040 --> 01:30:56,760
Strange man you are.

1710
01:30:57,760 --> 01:30:59,840
Okay drink.

1711
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:01,240
Thank you.

1712
01:31:10,200 --> 01:31:10,920
What happened?

1713
01:31:11,080 --> 01:31:15,160
These rich people are so stingy.

1714
01:31:15,240 --> 01:31:18,280
After begging for two hours we
got this and that also without sugar.

1715
01:31:18,360 --> 01:31:20,160
What are you talking?
Is there no sugar in this?

1716
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:21,760
What should we do now?

1717
01:31:23,080 --> 01:31:25,160
I have an idea.
- What?

1718
01:31:25,480 --> 01:31:26,840
Wait, let me think.

1719
01:31:26,920 --> 01:31:28,600
Idea and that also you have to think.

1720
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:34,800
Bomb, bond....

1721
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:37,080
Brother, let me tell you one thing.

1722
01:31:37,480 --> 01:31:40,600
Since long this idea
was coming to my mind.

1723
01:31:40,680 --> 01:31:42,120
But just could not speak.

1724
01:31:42,200 --> 01:31:44,920
It is the effect of the company.

1725
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:48,440
What has she given?

1726
01:31:48,520 --> 01:31:53,480
After Duryodhan only
you have dared to insult.

1727
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:56,000
What do you mean?

1728
01:31:56,080 --> 01:31:59,480
It means to insult someone physically.

1729
01:31:59,560 --> 01:32:02,040
Is there any other
way to make someone naked?

1730
01:32:02,080 --> 01:32:04,360
Yes brother.
Which one?

1731
01:32:04,440 --> 01:32:05,560
Emotionally.

1732
01:32:19,240 --> 01:32:20,040
Hi.

1733
01:32:21,160 --> 01:32:23,760
Greetings.
- Greetings.

1734
01:32:24,720 --> 01:32:26,000
You seem to belong to this place.

1735
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:30,640
What do you mean?
I was born in Faislabad.

1736
01:32:31,160 --> 01:32:35,840
Okay. Don't you feel
guilty in working with D?

1737
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:43,560
I mean in whatever you are
saying is not with conviction.

1738
01:32:43,880 --> 01:32:45,080
What is that?

1739
01:32:46,320 --> 01:32:51,000
You are not saying with true
heart whatever you want to say.

1740
01:32:51,200 --> 01:32:55,080
I am unmarried so do
not know the matter of heart.

1741
01:32:55,720 --> 01:33:00,360
If I was Gafur instead of Girdhari
then would you ask this question?

1742
01:33:00,440 --> 01:33:01,440
About guilt.

1743
01:33:05,320 --> 01:33:06,400
Do you want number?

1744
01:33:06,560 --> 01:33:09,120
No, there is a call for me.
Excuse me.

1745
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:11,720
Yes sir.

1746
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:14,720
Come on Arnab,
he is killing you out there.

1747
01:33:15,440 --> 01:33:17,480
Have you gone there to
ask questions or give answers?

1748
01:33:17,880 --> 01:33:20,280
Just kick him in the guts man.

1749
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
Do you know what the
reaction of the public is?

1750
01:33:23,200 --> 01:33:27,400
You are trending globally
with a hash tag national hero.

1751
01:33:27,480 --> 01:33:29,240
Do you know what that means?

1752
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:32,160
He is smarter than
what we had thought of.

1753
01:33:32,640 --> 01:33:35,120
But don't worry it
is just the interval.

1754
01:33:35,320 --> 01:33:37,720
I will take care. Okay.

1755
01:33:40,400 --> 01:33:43,200
I think we are missing
an opportunity here.

1756
01:33:43,880 --> 01:33:46,920
We are interviewing the
biggest interview of the century.

1757
01:33:48,120 --> 01:33:51,560
Do you understand? This is Arnab v/s D

1758
01:33:52,120 --> 01:33:56,200
Alright then 3, 2, 1 going live.

1759
01:33:56,280 --> 01:33:59,000
Welcome back to the most
exciting part of the interview.

1760
01:33:59,080 --> 01:34:00,120
The rapid fire.

1761
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:03,720
Yes, this is my favorite.
- Not this one sir.

1762
01:34:03,800 --> 01:34:07,480
Okay, the one in which you
ask questions one after the other.

1763
01:34:07,560 --> 01:34:10,440
And the one who gives answers
just say anything in haste.

1764
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:13,120
Is it that?
- Yes exactly.

1765
01:34:13,320 --> 01:34:14,120
So shall we move ahead?

1766
01:34:14,200 --> 01:34:16,040
You go ahead. I will speak from here.

1767
01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:20,680
In this round I will ask
you five questions in 1 minute.

1768
01:34:20,760 --> 01:34:22,680
You have to answer them quickly.

1769
01:34:22,760 --> 01:34:23,640
1st question.

1770
01:34:24,200 --> 01:34:28,040
If you are left alone
on an island for one week..

1771
01:34:28,080 --> 01:34:29,920
..then whom would you
like to take with you?

1772
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:31,000
Anyone would do.

1773
01:34:31,160 --> 01:34:32,280
What do you mean that anyone would do?

1774
01:34:32,360 --> 01:34:35,320
Because whosoever will come with me
but only I will be alive after one week.

1775
01:34:35,400 --> 01:34:39,280
If you get a chance
to meet American president..

1776
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:42,680
..Pakistan PM and Indian
PM then who would you like to meet.

1777
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:44,440
I do not like the Indian one.

1778
01:34:44,920 --> 01:34:47,000
US one is scared of me.

1779
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:49,880
And as far as Pakistan PM is concerned
then he is almost here all the time.

1780
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,080
Wait for 10 minutes and
I shall make you meet him.

1781
01:34:53,040 --> 01:34:55,120
Virat or Shahid?
- Whoever takes the money?

1782
01:34:55,320 --> 01:34:57,640
AK 47 or AK 56

1783
01:34:58,520 --> 01:35:02,160
Brain...most dangerous.

1784
01:35:02,240 --> 01:35:04,040
Nazreena or Geetika.

1785
01:35:04,120 --> 01:35:05,280
Both....

1786
01:35:06,600 --> 01:35:08,680
Not both but you have to choose one.

1787
01:35:08,920 --> 01:35:12,160
Both have come here.

1788
01:35:12,240 --> 01:35:13,040
Okay.

1789
01:35:13,120 --> 01:35:17,240
If there is biopic on D then
whom would you want to play your role?

1790
01:35:18,040 --> 01:35:19,040
Shashi Kapoor.

1791
01:35:19,120 --> 01:35:20,640
Mr. Shashi Kapoor. Why?

1792
01:35:20,720 --> 01:35:24,120
Even I have bungalow,
car and money but..

1793
01:35:24,520 --> 01:35:26,760
..mother is still with him till today.

1794
01:35:26,840 --> 01:35:27,720
Okay.

1795
01:35:27,800 --> 01:35:29,600
Black money or white money?

1796
01:35:30,760 --> 01:35:34,600
I am not racist like you.
Black and white is same for me.

1797
01:35:34,680 --> 01:35:36,160
Okay favorite song?

1798
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:45,520
"The heart still finds
those free days and nights...."

1799
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:55,120
"The heart still finds
those free days and nights...."

1800
01:35:55,200 --> 01:35:56,880
"We kept on sitting..."

1801
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:58,560
You want me to dance now.....

1802
01:35:58,640 --> 01:35:59,480
Ask further.

1803
01:35:59,560 --> 01:36:02,880
I thought audience would
like to hear you singing.

1804
01:36:04,120 --> 01:36:07,120
Anyone can sing.
Nowadays even cricketers are singing.

1805
01:36:07,840 --> 01:36:11,520
If you would like to change one thing
in your life then what would it be.

1806
01:36:11,720 --> 01:36:15,040
Instead of Dongri I would
like to be born in Colaba.

1807
01:36:15,120 --> 01:36:17,360
After that life would
automatically change.

1808
01:36:17,440 --> 01:36:22,360
I have to say that you
have answered well and frank.

1809
01:36:22,440 --> 01:36:24,680
Leave all this, where is the hamper?

1810
01:36:25,040 --> 01:36:25,760
Which hamper?

1811
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:29,920
The hamper that you
give after the rapid fire.

1812
01:36:30,040 --> 01:36:31,440
I did not talk about that.

1813
01:36:31,520 --> 01:36:33,120
That is not my problem
if you did not talk.

1814
01:36:33,200 --> 01:36:35,600
A hamper is always
given after rapid fire.

1815
01:36:35,680 --> 01:36:36,400
Everyone knows it.

1816
01:36:36,480 --> 01:36:37,600
Do you know or not?

1817
01:36:38,040 --> 01:36:38,880
Where is it?

1818
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:42,080
Sir, we will get it delivered
to you once we reach India.

1819
01:36:45,360 --> 01:36:48,160
Hurry up and ask further.
It is time for my prayers.

1820
01:36:48,400 --> 01:36:50,440
So Mr. D this is our
live audience segment.

1821
01:36:50,520 --> 01:36:53,600
In Mumbai studio a panel
of three people is sitting.

1822
01:36:53,680 --> 01:36:55,240
They will directly
ask questions from you.

1823
01:36:56,120 --> 01:36:58,680
First of all Rohit Shukla from JNU.

1824
01:36:59,080 --> 01:37:01,400
Rohit, ask your question please.

1825
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:04,480
Mr. D your responses till now show..

1826
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:06,320
..that you do not
have illegal business..

1827
01:37:06,400 --> 01:37:08,640
..and till now you have
never gone against law.

1828
01:37:08,720 --> 01:37:10,440
Practically very hard to believe.

1829
01:37:10,760 --> 01:37:13,680
Hey, when did I say this sir?

1830
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:16,640
No Mr D we can have
a re learn of the interview.

1831
01:37:16,720 --> 01:37:19,240
We are asking you something
and you are answering differently.

1832
01:37:19,320 --> 01:37:23,200
Instead of you if I play interview of
Chhota Bheem it would look the same.

1833
01:37:23,280 --> 01:37:25,040
Really..
- Yes..

1834
01:37:25,120 --> 01:37:26,320
Come on....

1835
01:37:27,240 --> 01:37:30,920
I have broken countless laws.

1836
01:37:31,040 --> 01:37:32,680
Now we are talking.
Tell us more please.

1837
01:37:32,760 --> 01:37:34,600
From last 3 years I
have not paid service tax.

1838
01:37:34,680 --> 01:37:37,400
So you mean you have not
broken bigger law than this.

1839
01:37:37,480 --> 01:37:42,840
Brother, you had said that
it is a family show so be censored.

1840
01:37:42,920 --> 01:37:45,520
Our next question is from Mr.
Vijay Chakraborty..

1841
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:49,720
..who is our special guest tonight
from external affairs ministry.

1842
01:37:51,320 --> 01:37:54,040
Can you tell us Mr. D that which
country's citizenship do you have?

1843
01:37:54,680 --> 01:37:57,440
Don't censor this.
I will take care of it.

1844
01:38:11,160 --> 01:38:14,880
Take this.
This is the proof of my citizenship.

1845
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,640
Whatever you feel is
more controversial keep it.

1846
01:38:18,640 --> 01:38:20,800
What the hell? What is this?

1847
01:38:21,400 --> 01:38:24,480
These are passport of 192 countries.

1848
01:38:26,520 --> 01:38:30,200
You want to say that you
are citizen of the entire world.

1849
01:38:30,280 --> 01:38:32,480
No, 4 still remain.

1850
01:38:32,560 --> 01:38:34,240
Girdhari, what happened
about those 4 countries?

1851
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:36,760
Brother, we have applied
for it so it will come in 4 days.

1852
01:38:36,840 --> 01:38:39,240
He must have made it in tatkaal.

1853
01:38:39,920 --> 01:38:42,040
He is the one who was
the owner of the gun shop.

1854
01:38:42,120 --> 01:38:45,720
Our next question is from
Miss Neha who is our ace news writer.

1855
01:38:47,680 --> 01:38:49,120
Hi Mr. D

1856
01:38:49,720 --> 01:38:52,200
This question is from
your female audience.

1857
01:38:52,320 --> 01:38:54,880
Why do you always keep
moustache and what is this..

1858
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,800
..fascination with the
same brand of sunglasses.

1859
01:38:59,680 --> 01:39:01,320
Why do I keep moustache?

1860
01:39:02,320 --> 01:39:04,520
I get a character.

1861
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:07,480
I cannot keep a tail so
that is why I keep moustaches.

1862
01:39:09,080 --> 01:39:13,080
Without moustaches I feel
a man is standing naked on the road.

1863
01:39:15,160 --> 01:39:17,440
As far as sunglasses are concerned.

1864
01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:22,160
So all things related
to me are banned in the world.

1865
01:39:22,360 --> 01:39:25,160
So my glasses would be Ray Ban.

1866
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:31,000
A big thanks to our
panel in Mumbai and to Neha.

1867
01:39:31,400 --> 01:39:33,080
World reminds me that..

1868
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:38,840
..there is a rumor that you knew
in advance about the Osama killings.

1869
01:39:39,040 --> 01:39:42,080
I knew it? My men killed him.

1870
01:39:43,120 --> 01:39:45,400
Such a big joke doesn't
suit your moustaches.

1871
01:39:45,480 --> 01:39:47,200
I am telling you the truth Mr. Arnab.

1872
01:39:47,440 --> 01:39:50,360
For three months he had not
paid the EMI of protection money.

1873
01:39:50,440 --> 01:39:51,520
So I had no option.

1874
01:39:51,600 --> 01:39:54,520
What are you talking?
US did such a big cowat operation.

1875
01:39:54,600 --> 01:39:55,840
A movie has been made on that.

1876
01:39:55,920 --> 01:39:59,040
A movie has been made on Jurassic
Park as well but that is not true.

1877
01:39:59,480 --> 01:40:03,880
So you are saying such a big
operation by US was a video game.

1878
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:04,760
Is that what you are saying?

1879
01:40:04,840 --> 01:40:07,360
Brother, anyone may do the operation..

1880
01:40:07,440 --> 01:40:10,680
..but what do you know which people
are behind the commando uniform.

1881
01:40:11,280 --> 01:40:14,600
Wow! It is very hard to tell
whether it is fact or fiction.

1882
01:40:15,480 --> 01:40:21,520
Even about 93 blasts no one
knows whether it is fact or fiction.

1883
01:40:23,560 --> 01:40:25,400
On that note we take a short break.

1884
01:40:25,480 --> 01:40:28,040
We will be back with our
final leg of the interview.

1885
01:40:39,680 --> 01:40:41,280
Hello, is everything fine there?

1886
01:40:41,480 --> 01:40:43,720
Everything is fine here.
But what are you doing?

1887
01:40:43,800 --> 01:40:44,480
What happened?

1888
01:40:44,560 --> 01:40:47,280
The problem is that
nothing has happened?

1889
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:51,600
I had married a man who
was court martial on live TV

1890
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:55,280
And not with a man who
would get scared of a hooligan.

1891
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:59,680
Otherwise what do you think a crime
reporter like me would marry you?

1892
01:40:59,760 --> 01:41:01,600
Tell me what do you want to say?

1893
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:05,000
Listen, it might
sound cheesy out to you

1894
01:41:05,280 --> 01:41:07,520
But you definitely remember
our journalism oath, right.

1895
01:41:08,040 --> 01:41:13,560
We will uphold the dignity of this
country and its media come what may.

1896
01:41:14,240 --> 01:41:16,800
Yes, it is getting cheesy and sweet.

1897
01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:19,520
Shut up, Arnab.
This is not a joke.

1898
01:41:21,200 --> 01:41:24,080
You are on the verge
of becoming national hero.

1899
01:41:25,400 --> 01:41:27,400
How many people get this chance?

1900
01:41:28,360 --> 01:41:30,720
Social media is going dessert.

1901
01:41:30,920 --> 01:41:32,480
Do you realize the gravity?

1902
01:41:32,680 --> 01:41:35,920
He must be a hooligan of somewhere.
What do we have to do?

1903
01:41:36,160 --> 01:41:39,520
Just remember that you are
the biggest hooligan of Indian media.

1904
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:43,120
This is not just an interview
anymore to save your job.

1905
01:41:43,920 --> 01:41:47,240
This is that trial of D which has not
happened in court for last 22 years.

1906
01:41:48,040 --> 01:41:50,120
And it does not matter
if it is a media trial.

1907
01:41:51,160 --> 01:41:54,360
We cannot afford to lose this Arnab.

1908
01:41:55,080 --> 01:41:58,160
And India cannot afford to lose this.
So don't worry about me.

1909
01:41:58,360 --> 01:41:59,360
I am fine.

1910
01:41:59,560 --> 01:42:01,600
And as it is I have
done a text to police.

1911
01:42:02,440 --> 01:42:06,440
So you just go out there
and grab him by his fucking balls.

1912
01:42:07,320 --> 01:42:08,480
Bye.

1913
01:42:27,520 --> 01:42:31,920
I had never thought that I
would smoke a cigarette with you ever.

1914
01:42:32,440 --> 01:42:34,000
Have you tried a cigar?

1915
01:42:35,080 --> 01:42:36,160
No.

1916
01:42:37,440 --> 01:42:38,840
It hurts my throat.

1917
01:42:41,440 --> 01:42:45,320
Do you know why I didn't
ask for interview's script..

1918
01:42:45,400 --> 01:42:47,760
..before saying yes to the interview?

1919
01:42:49,080 --> 01:42:52,440
Because I thought
you are a family man..

1920
01:42:53,080 --> 01:42:57,840
..and would remain in your limits
because of fear of wife's death.

1921
01:42:58,080 --> 01:42:59,640
I thought you would
remain in your limits.

1922
01:43:00,600 --> 01:43:04,160
But I had forgotten that media
people never remain in their limits.

1923
01:43:08,240 --> 01:43:09,760
Just relax.

1924
01:43:10,040 --> 01:43:12,640
We both will together take
care of the interview further.

1925
01:43:12,720 --> 01:43:14,360
But remain in your limits.

1926
01:43:15,360 --> 01:43:21,160
Otherwise it is Don's interview
on live TV so anything can happen.

1927
01:43:22,200 --> 01:43:23,360
What did you understand?

1928
01:43:26,680 --> 01:43:27,800
-It is happening too much.
-Yes you are right.

1929
01:43:27,880 --> 01:43:28,800
Okay fine.
- Okay.

1930
01:43:31,240 --> 01:43:34,280
It is the last leg of the
interview so let's make it count.

1931
01:43:34,480 --> 01:43:37,080
This is your revised
draft for the final segment.

1932
01:43:37,160 --> 01:43:38,880
Just show him his place Arnab.

1933
01:43:44,280 --> 01:43:47,520
Welcome back to One
on One with me Arnab Ghsoh.

1934
01:43:47,600 --> 01:43:49,600
Now we have reached
our final segment..

1935
01:43:49,680 --> 01:43:53,360
..where we will ask some
inconvenient questions to MR. D

1936
01:43:54,320 --> 01:43:56,280
Are you ready?
- Yes.

1937
01:43:57,760 --> 01:44:01,080
From your talks we can make out that
your influence is on the global level.

1938
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:05,240
So were you behind
the hijacking in Kandahar?

1939
01:44:05,320 --> 01:44:07,880
It is a limit.

1940
01:44:08,320 --> 01:44:09,440
Now you would say..

1941
01:44:09,520 --> 01:44:12,040
..that I am responsible for the
Malaysian airlines that got missing.

1942
01:44:12,120 --> 01:44:13,520
I won't say that but
a Gulf news report says so.

1943
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,600
I won't say that but
a Gulf news report says so.

1944
01:44:16,680 --> 01:44:18,240
This report is right.

1945
01:44:18,320 --> 01:44:20,280
So are you telling
me a fact or a fiction?

1946
01:44:20,360 --> 01:44:23,120
I have said what I wanted to say
now understand whatever you want to.

1947
01:44:23,200 --> 01:44:25,880
Mr. D let me be very
categorical in my question.

1948
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,840
So you are saying that you
are behind the disappearance..

1949
01:44:28,920 --> 01:44:32,280
..of two Malaysian
planes including MH 370.

1950
01:44:32,360 --> 01:44:35,920
There is no need to be hyper.
Relax, relax..

1951
01:44:36,040 --> 01:44:37,720
Is there no need to get hyper?

1952
01:44:37,880 --> 01:44:41,600
You are saying that
flight disappearance..

1953
01:44:41,680 --> 01:44:44,280
..in Malaysia have
been engineered by you.

1954
01:44:44,360 --> 01:44:46,320
And you are asking me to calm down.

1955
01:44:47,240 --> 01:44:50,720
All this has been made by media,
my brother.

1956
01:44:50,800 --> 01:44:53,440
Nothing of this kind had happened.
- Then what had happened?

1957
01:44:53,800 --> 01:44:58,240
What happened was that I had to sit in
flight from Kuala Lampur to Karachi.

1958
01:44:58,440 --> 01:45:00,680
And those rascals made
e sit in Beijing flight.

1959
01:45:00,760 --> 01:45:02,360
Tell me what my fault in this is.

1960
01:45:02,920 --> 01:45:05,360
I had to reach hurriedly
for my nephew's wedding..

1961
01:45:05,440 --> 01:45:07,520
..so we had to divert the flight.

1962
01:45:07,600 --> 01:45:09,320
Look, she is standing behind you.

1963
01:45:10,280 --> 01:45:13,400
Now you will say that passengers
of the flight are also here.

1964
01:45:16,680 --> 01:45:20,360
So do you think I have so many
servants in my house from beginning?

1965
01:45:23,840 --> 01:45:26,280
What about the second Malaysian plane?

1966
01:45:26,480 --> 01:45:30,400
You are too much, Arnab.

1967
01:45:31,080 --> 01:45:36,160
After the problem I faced am I
stupid to travel by that flight again.

1968
01:45:36,680 --> 01:45:41,560
No wonders your name is also
there in the top 10 list of the FBI

1969
01:45:42,160 --> 01:45:45,200
This is the problem.
- What is the problem?

1970
01:45:45,360 --> 01:45:51,200
The problem is Arnab
that I used to be number 1.

1971
01:45:51,480 --> 01:45:55,160
In last three years I
have come down to number 6.

1972
01:45:55,520 --> 01:46:00,360
Boys whom I have trained
are on top of the list.

1973
01:46:00,600 --> 01:46:02,680
What times have come?

1974
01:46:02,760 --> 01:46:04,520
You have become sentimental.

1975
01:46:04,680 --> 01:46:06,800
No problem. Everyone's time comes.

1976
01:46:08,520 --> 01:46:13,280
I think that censor
thing does not apply to you.

1977
01:46:13,480 --> 01:46:16,600
It does apply Mr. D but
I also get sentimental sometimes.

1978
01:46:17,040 --> 01:46:20,040
I am sure you must be having
plan to become number 1 again.

1979
01:46:20,120 --> 01:46:21,640
Yes I have a plan.

1980
01:46:22,800 --> 01:46:27,280
If I shoot you on live TV
then I can become number 1 overnight.

1981
01:46:27,360 --> 01:46:29,440
You are again talking like a hooligan.

1982
01:46:29,800 --> 01:46:31,920
There is a difference
between saying and doing Mr. D.

1983
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:33,120
My hero.

1984
01:46:33,200 --> 01:46:37,640
Finally on popular
demand one last question.

1985
01:46:37,800 --> 01:46:39,000
Popular demand.

1986
01:46:40,280 --> 01:46:42,280
Will I have to dance?

1987
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:46,520
You can do if you wish
to but that is not the case.

1988
01:46:46,880 --> 01:46:48,000
Okay.

1989
01:46:48,160 --> 01:46:51,680
Viewers want to know that you..

1990
01:46:51,760 --> 01:46:53,280
..have many fake accounts
on facebook and twitter.

1991
01:46:53,360 --> 01:46:56,520
Often you are being bullied on that.
What do you have to say about that?

1992
01:46:56,600 --> 01:46:57,720
Are you saying correct?

1993
01:46:58,040 --> 01:46:59,640
Of course.

1994
01:47:01,280 --> 01:47:05,080
One account is exactly
on your name with status update..

1995
01:47:05,160 --> 01:47:07,320
..check in, and share happening often.

1996
01:47:07,400 --> 01:47:08,320
Show it to me.

1997
01:47:08,760 --> 01:47:10,040
Show me which account is this?

1998
01:47:12,760 --> 01:47:14,640
This one.
- Yes.

1999
01:47:19,520 --> 01:47:22,000
What is the matter?
Why are you laughing at your own joke?

2000
01:47:22,040 --> 01:47:23,280
This is my account.

2001
01:47:25,520 --> 01:47:27,680
Girdhari takes care of it.

2002
01:47:28,480 --> 01:47:30,000
Show Girdhari..

2003
01:47:30,920 --> 01:47:32,320
Look, look..

2004
01:47:32,880 --> 01:47:33,760
Look.

2005
01:47:34,440 --> 01:47:38,200
I had gone to Malaysia and
had checked-in in that hotel. Look.

2006
01:47:38,600 --> 01:47:42,920
Once I was getting a philosopher
kind of feeling like..

2007
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:47,760
..Danish type so I asked
him to put that status.

2008
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:50,160
Look, look..

2009
01:47:50,880 --> 01:47:54,720
I had gone to PM's daughter's wedding
and I have put photograph of the deal.

2010
01:47:58,800 --> 01:48:02,280
Look Girdhari the face of
facebook has become like Doordarshan.

2011
01:48:02,360 --> 01:48:05,520
You had put these
on..what do you call it?

2012
01:48:05,600 --> 01:48:07,160
Gram Panchayat.

2013
01:48:07,240 --> 01:48:09,760
Gram Panchayat.
- Instagram.

2014
01:48:09,840 --> 01:48:11,280
Instagram.

2015
01:48:12,360 --> 01:48:14,360
Don't do anything that
will lead to thrashing.

2016
01:48:14,440 --> 01:48:16,320
One last question?

2017
01:48:18,200 --> 01:48:20,280
Why did you escape from India?

2018
01:48:22,200 --> 01:48:23,480
I did not escape.

2019
01:48:24,520 --> 01:48:28,320
I was going to settle
in Dubai to expand my business.

2020
01:48:28,600 --> 01:48:32,480
Unfortunately the blasts took place
and you all thought that I escaped.

2021
01:48:33,240 --> 01:48:35,760
Then why did you leave
your people alone in India.

2022
01:48:36,200 --> 01:48:39,320
Or you had planned
to settle abroad alone.

2023
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:41,320
That's okay. There is no problem.

2024
01:48:41,400 --> 01:48:44,280
There are many people who
are not bothered about others.

2025
01:48:44,440 --> 01:48:46,600
And go away from home for business.
That is fine.

2026
01:48:46,680 --> 01:48:51,000
Arnab, this time I will
not show a trailer on mobile..

2027
01:48:51,720 --> 01:48:53,400
..but will show live shooting.

2028
01:48:53,480 --> 01:48:57,040
What trailer will you show me?
I will show you your status.

2029
01:48:57,120 --> 01:48:58,920
Hey, talk sensibly.

2030
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:00,120
Hey, you keep quiet.

2031
01:49:00,320 --> 01:49:02,000
You do not have the status
to become constable in your country..

2032
01:49:02,040 --> 01:49:03,640
..and here you are his right hand.

2033
01:49:03,720 --> 01:49:05,160
Do you know what
you do with right hand?

2034
01:49:05,240 --> 01:49:08,600
Quiet. - Girdhari, leave it. A it
is the bullets have become expensive.

2035
01:49:08,680 --> 01:49:10,240
Why are you wasting it? Leave it.

2036
01:49:11,840 --> 01:49:15,360
D I will tell you
what your problem is.

2037
01:49:15,560 --> 01:49:18,760
You have kept 200 body
guards and security system..

2038
01:49:18,840 --> 01:49:20,280
..because you are scared.

2039
01:49:20,720 --> 01:49:23,000
Sitting under so much
of security in the house..

2040
01:49:23,080 --> 01:49:25,120
..you are talking about courage.

2041
01:49:25,200 --> 01:49:28,880
If you are such a big dynamic
Don then dare to come back.

2042
01:49:29,360 --> 01:49:32,560
Delhi is only 1100 kms away
from here but you cannot go there.

2043
01:49:32,840 --> 01:49:35,280
You can go to Nairobi, Malaysia..

2044
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:38,800
..and even have passport
of the world with you.

2045
01:49:38,880 --> 01:49:42,160
But will never come to Delhi.
Shall I tell you why?

2046
01:49:42,240 --> 01:49:44,040
Because you belong to no one.

2047
01:49:44,760 --> 01:49:47,680
You neither belong to your
family nor to your country men.

2048
01:49:47,840 --> 01:49:52,520
The country in which you were born
you killed 257 people of that country.

2049
01:49:52,600 --> 01:49:58,200
The area that brought you up is going
to police and court because of you.

2050
01:49:58,280 --> 01:50:00,600
But you think that you are Don.

2051
01:50:00,680 --> 01:50:05,400
You are Bhai but your brother was
hanged six months ago in our country.

2052
01:50:05,480 --> 01:50:06,360
Do you remember?

2053
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:08,400
You should have saved him.

2054
01:50:08,640 --> 01:50:11,240
You are scared of
your own criminal record.

2055
01:50:11,320 --> 01:50:15,680
You are so scared that for your
crime you let your brother get hanged.

2056
01:50:19,160 --> 01:50:19,640
Take this.

2057
01:50:19,840 --> 01:50:21,720
If I play this CD now..

2058
01:50:21,800 --> 01:50:23,480
..then it will take
only 5 minutes to prove..

2059
01:50:23,560 --> 01:50:25,600
..that all allegations
on you are true.

2060
01:50:26,040 --> 01:50:29,520
You are fond of watching movies
so let's watch this CD together.

2061
01:50:30,280 --> 01:50:34,160
You will not see because till today
you have been running from yourself.

2062
01:50:34,800 --> 01:50:37,160
Don are those who accept
their crime openly.

2063
01:50:37,240 --> 01:50:40,080
They either accept or deny openly.

2064
01:50:40,160 --> 01:50:43,000
They do not hide behind random
fantasy stories just as you do.

2065
01:50:43,080 --> 01:50:46,000
But what to do you are a coward.

2066
01:50:46,560 --> 01:50:50,040
Now rest of your life you
will escape from these allegations..

2067
01:50:50,120 --> 01:50:53,936
..and when you die then everyone
will run from burial place..

2068
01:50:54,016 --> 01:50:57,760
..because there will be no difference
between you and your crimes.

2069
01:50:58,040 --> 01:51:02,360
This is your luck D.
you are not Don but fraud.

2070
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:06,000
Wow! Arnab.

2071
01:51:18,080 --> 01:51:19,520
Brother...
- What have you done?

2072
01:51:23,120 --> 01:51:24,040
I have not done anything.

2073
01:51:24,120 --> 01:51:25,360
Give me the arms.

2074
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:26,440
You take care of brother.

2075
01:51:26,520 --> 01:51:28,240
Girdhari, he has killed brother.

2076
01:51:28,320 --> 01:51:30,080
I have to take revenge
for what he has done.

2077
01:51:30,160 --> 01:51:31,000
Take care here.

2078
01:51:31,160 --> 01:51:33,360
Out, get out....

2079
01:51:42,080 --> 01:51:43,360
Brother....

2080
01:51:43,440 --> 01:51:46,000
Oh god, he has made me crazy.

2081
01:51:46,040 --> 01:51:48,480
Brother's heart is very good.
- Come on..

2082
01:51:48,720 --> 01:51:52,160
so he had to get heart attack.
- Come on, come on it is time to go.

2083
01:51:52,360 --> 01:51:54,320
Brother's heart is very big.
- Okay..

2084
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:55,840
Bye...

2085
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,440
Come on....

2086
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:01,800
Brother....

2087
01:52:03,640 --> 01:52:05,320
Hey, come on.

2088
01:52:06,480 --> 01:52:07,160
Come..

2089
01:52:13,160 --> 01:52:14,560
Do you know what the right hand does?

2090
01:52:14,640 --> 01:52:17,560
The right hand shoots, presses
the trigger, slaps and takes revenge.

2091
01:52:17,640 --> 01:52:19,480
Don't give me speech.
Finish it.

2092
01:52:19,720 --> 01:52:21,040
Come on escape.
- Please.. please..

2093
01:52:21,280 --> 01:52:22,880
500mts away you will find our men.

2094
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:24,760
They will help you
to reach your home safely.

2095
01:52:25,120 --> 01:52:25,880
What are you saying?

2096
01:52:26,360 --> 01:52:27,280
I am saying the truth.

2097
01:52:28,200 --> 01:52:28,720
Come on.

2098
01:52:29,400 --> 01:52:30,840
I am not believer in violence now.

2099
01:52:30,920 --> 01:52:32,040
I believe in love.

2100
01:52:32,120 --> 01:52:32,800
Are you joking?

2101
01:52:32,880 --> 01:52:34,680
No, come on run....

2102
01:52:35,600 --> 01:52:38,840
Hey, good bye Neha.

2103
01:52:40,200 --> 01:52:41,720
Don't look behind and see.

2104
01:52:49,640 --> 01:52:50,640
Bye..

2105
01:52:51,600 --> 01:52:54,720
You are welcome in this
special edition of news.

2106
01:52:54,800 --> 01:52:58,000
Harsh words took away D's life.

2107
01:52:58,320 --> 01:53:02,240
Today's breaking news
is that our star reporter..

2108
01:53:02,320 --> 01:53:07,320
..Arnab Ghosh has killed
dangerous Don D in his house.

2109
01:53:07,560 --> 01:53:09,640
There has been turmoil in the country.

2110
01:53:16,040 --> 01:53:17,880
You became a star overnight, baby.

2111
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:21,040
I was born as a super star.
- You are right.

2112
01:53:22,280 --> 01:53:24,800
Okay, I wanted to tell you something.

2113
01:53:24,880 --> 01:53:25,840
Tell me.

2114
01:53:27,520 --> 01:53:30,000
You know this interview was
very tough and challenging for me.

2115
01:53:30,040 --> 01:53:30,880
You know it.

2116
01:53:32,240 --> 01:53:34,280
I had to accept many challenges.

2117
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:36,000
I know.

2118
01:53:36,400 --> 01:53:38,200
I had to compromise.

2119
01:53:38,280 --> 01:53:39,720
I know.
- You don't know.

2120
01:53:44,400 --> 01:53:46,240
Are you telling me that
you have to compromise with D.

2121
01:53:46,320 --> 01:53:47,560
No, no not that bad.

2122
01:53:48,040 --> 01:53:49,560
Then anything else would do.

2123
01:53:49,640 --> 01:53:50,800
I don't think so.

2124
01:53:51,040 --> 01:53:52,200
What do you mean?

2125
01:53:53,440 --> 01:53:58,000
Actually I will have to
sleep with Neha for one night.

2126
01:54:02,120 --> 01:54:04,760
What do you mean you have
to sleep for one night with Neha?

2127
01:54:04,840 --> 01:54:06,040
Only one night.

2128
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:09,840
What rubbish is that?
- Only one.

2129
01:54:11,040 --> 01:54:12,640
So you have guts to tell me this.

2130
01:54:12,840 --> 01:54:13,840
Not to.

2131
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:16,600
You have a pregnant wife.

2132
01:54:18,920 --> 01:54:21,800
You are a rascal.
You are such a creep.

2133
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:24,080
Say sorry.

2134
01:54:25,680 --> 01:54:26,680
Say sorry.

2135
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:27,800
Sorry.

2136
01:54:27,880 --> 01:54:29,000
One more time.

2137
01:54:30,040 --> 01:54:30,920
Only one.

2138
01:54:31,120 --> 01:54:32,360
Sorry.

2139
01:54:33,120 --> 01:54:34,400
Only one time.

2140
01:54:35,240 --> 01:54:36,560
Say sorry.

2141
01:54:37,440 --> 01:54:39,280
Sorry.

2142
01:54:39,360 --> 01:54:41,600
You area such a creep.

2143
01:54:41,880 --> 01:54:44,640
Okay, okay I am going to the doctor.

2144
01:54:45,480 --> 01:54:46,440
That's it.

2145
01:54:46,520 --> 01:54:50,120
And listen celebration is due tonight.

2146
01:54:50,360 --> 01:54:53,800
If you are with me.
- Not bad.

2147
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,680
Among so much crowd....

2148
01:54:57,120 --> 01:55:02,880
The biggest.. is being
offered to the country.

2149
01:55:03,480 --> 01:55:04,280
Hello.

2150
01:55:04,360 --> 01:55:07,640
Shall I call you brother
Arnab or senior editor Mr. Arnab.

2151
01:55:08,760 --> 01:55:09,920
Hello.

2152
01:55:10,240 --> 01:55:13,080
I am saying greetings Mr. Arnab.

2153
01:55:16,160 --> 01:55:17,120
D.

2154
01:55:17,720 --> 01:55:20,560
To hell with D.

2155
01:55:21,160 --> 01:55:26,040
You are talking to
David Adrees Kalemen.

2156
01:55:27,080 --> 01:55:30,920
The time has come to do that thing
which we have been planning to do.

2157
01:55:31,560 --> 01:55:33,320
Brother, as you say.

2158
01:55:34,400 --> 01:55:37,160
I will do acting of
heart attack and fall.

2159
01:55:37,240 --> 01:55:38,280
Okay.

2160
01:55:38,640 --> 01:55:43,760
And you make them
reach India safely. Okay.

2161
01:55:43,840 --> 01:55:48,400
So that they can make the
news of my death as breaking news.

2162
01:55:48,840 --> 01:55:49,560
Okay brother.

2163
01:55:49,640 --> 01:55:51,880
And you will be free from this life.

2164
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:57,760
Yes Girdhari.
I wanted to kill him on live TV

2165
01:55:58,280 --> 01:56:02,720
Then I thought there
is an opportunity and..

2166
01:56:02,800 --> 01:56:05,680
..why should I waste it
by committing a murder.

2167
01:56:05,760 --> 01:56:09,000
Or give birth to a new life for me.

2168
01:56:09,880 --> 01:56:10,800
Did you understand?

2169
01:56:12,240 --> 01:56:16,280
You did not even know and you
became a chess piece of D's chess.

2170
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:25,320
Today I am going to
step into my new life.

2171
01:56:25,640 --> 01:56:27,120
It is because of your favor.

2172
01:56:27,440 --> 01:56:34,280
Do remember me if you want
a promotion or money?

2173
01:56:34,520 --> 01:56:35,800
I will not refuse you.

2174
01:56:40,520 --> 01:56:42,080
What are you doing?

2175
01:56:42,160 --> 01:56:44,400
Have you taken the shock to heart?

2176
01:56:45,920 --> 01:56:50,680
Sorry buddy.
I am trying not to laugh but...

2177
01:56:54,200 --> 01:56:57,160
Whom are you calling buddy?
Do you know whom are you talking to?

2178
01:56:58,240 --> 01:57:01,440
With David Adrees Kalemen.

2179
01:57:04,080 --> 01:57:10,600
Buddy, I have seen many amazing
and foolish people in my media career.

2180
01:57:10,840 --> 01:57:16,000
But you are too great.
You are above all.

2181
01:57:19,160 --> 01:57:21,600
Do you know what have you done today?

2182
01:57:21,680 --> 01:57:25,320
With your cunningness
you have done something..

2183
01:57:25,400 --> 01:57:28,840
..which international police
and intelligence could not do.

2184
01:57:29,120 --> 01:57:33,520
You killed D with your own hands today.

2185
01:57:34,920 --> 01:57:38,720
You think yourself to be a remote
control but you are actually..

2186
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:43,040
..a useless remote control of a TV
which is also there in my house.

2187
01:57:44,320 --> 01:57:46,200
Your story is amazing.

2188
01:57:46,280 --> 01:57:52,240
You were born in India and
then you went to Dubai.

2189
01:57:52,320 --> 01:57:55,080
Then because of fear of Interpol
you escaped to Pakistan.

2190
01:57:55,160 --> 01:57:57,600
Then you got so scared
that you disappeared..

2191
01:57:57,680 --> 01:58:00,440
..not only from Pakistan
but from world map.

2192
01:58:01,720 --> 01:58:03,400
Great.

2193
01:58:03,640 --> 01:58:08,440
I have to say that everyone
is in love with his own identity..

2194
01:58:08,520 --> 01:58:12,520
..but you destroyed your identity.

2195
01:58:12,600 --> 01:58:14,240
Superb, buddy.

2196
01:58:15,320 --> 01:58:18,400
Honestly I am grateful to you.

2197
01:58:18,480 --> 01:58:21,760
You freed my country
from your hangover.

2198
01:58:21,840 --> 01:58:23,000
Total free.

2199
01:58:23,040 --> 01:58:27,640
Because of our police and intelligence
your fear had already disappeared.

2200
01:58:27,720 --> 01:58:32,440
But you finished the fear
of your name as well.

2201
01:58:32,520 --> 01:58:36,640
Superb. D, D is gone.

2202
01:58:36,720 --> 01:58:40,000
Look what amazing thing I did.

2203
01:58:40,280 --> 01:58:44,160
I am sure you must be standing in the..

2204
01:58:44,240 --> 01:58:47,520
..ticket line of an amusement
park wearing red hat.

2205
01:58:47,600 --> 01:58:51,920
But my stomach is twisting
because of laughter.

2206
01:58:53,800 --> 01:58:57,560
Now I will take your leave.
I will keep the phone.

2207
01:58:57,640 --> 01:58:59,920
Okay. But one minute.

2208
01:59:00,160 --> 01:59:02,760
Do you know what date is today?
15th August.

2209
01:59:02,840 --> 01:59:07,560
No one must have thought that today you
will free us from yourself.

2210
01:59:09,360 --> 01:59:12,760
Now I have an important
meeting with real people.

2211
01:59:14,520 --> 01:59:16,000
Thanks for calling.

2212
01:59:17,480 --> 01:59:20,320
Hello, hello.....

2213
01:59:24,920 --> 01:59:28,360
Brother, he is asking for change.

2214
01:59:31,040 --> 01:59:33,080
Always keep change. Understood.

2215
01:59:33,360 --> 01:59:34,560
Do you know who I am?

2216
01:59:34,640 --> 01:59:35,800
D

2217
01:59:37,200 --> 01:59:38,360
Come on brother.

2218
01:59:38,440 --> 01:59:40,800
From the time he has dies
everyone think of themselves as D.

2219
01:59:40,880 --> 01:59:43,840
Look there.
Upcoming movie Coffee With D

2220
01:59:44,760 --> 01:59:46,000
Brother...

2221
01:59:46,720 --> 01:59:47,800
You come, please.
