1
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:04,792
How are you, brother-in-law?

2
00:03:04,917 --> 00:03:07,916
I'm great. Come on in!
- I'll join you.

3
00:03:07,917 --> 00:03:08,542
Certainly.

4
00:03:08,667 --> 00:03:10,625
Did you get the photo?
- Photo?

5
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:14,042
I've brought her entire biodata,
sis; take a look.

6
00:03:14,167 --> 00:03:15,125
Don't peep in.

7
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:18,041
Go to the kitchen.
- Get me a pancake.

8
00:03:18,042 --> 00:03:18,916
Yes, uncle.

9
00:03:18,917 --> 00:03:20,457
She's Shukla's daughter.
- Look.

10
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:22,375
I've got all the details on her.

11
00:03:23,042 --> 00:03:24,458
She belongs to a good family.

12
00:03:24,792 --> 00:03:26,042
Remember, Mom always said:

13
00:03:26,167 --> 00:03:28,792
'Bring home a daughter-in-law
from a poorer family.'

14
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:31,792
Her family will remain intimidated.
- Uncle.

15
00:03:32,042 --> 00:03:33,250
She's beautiful.
- Oh, great.

16
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:35,917
I think she is a little
too beautiful.

17
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:38,708
It shouldn't be that
she is always busy doing make up

18
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:40,416
while we cook for her.

19
00:03:40,417 --> 00:03:43,624
She won't dare to do that.
- You think you will cook for her ever?

20
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:45,875
I don't expect you to do that, Shanti.

21
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,332
Of course, you expect
the worst from me!

22
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:49,292
Show me.

23
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:54,207
Child, call Sattu.
Ask him to meet the girl on Sunday.

24
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:55,208
All right, Dad.

25
00:03:59,042 --> 00:03:59,917
Tell me,

26
00:04:00,042 --> 00:04:02,542
why are you always so nervous
when you meet a girl?

27
00:04:02,667 --> 00:04:05,083
How can one take a decision after
meeting a girl only for ten minutes

28
00:04:05,417 --> 00:04:07,582
that you want to marry her and
spend the rest of your life with her?

29
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:08,542
Oh.
- Yeah.

30
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,917
And if you take the wrong decision,
buddy,

31
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,708
your whole life is ruined.

32
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:14,500
Then don't take your decision
in ten minutes. - And?

33
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:16,541
Hire an expensive Mercedes.

34
00:04:16,542 --> 00:04:18,333
Go with her in the fancy car.

35
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:21,207
Check her out; totally.

36
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:23,249
Then you'll be able to
take the right decision.

37
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:26,708
I have a better idea.
Why don't I check out your girl?

38
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,999
I'll check her out; totally.

39
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,417
Shut up, you fool!

40
00:04:29,792 --> 00:04:31,166
She'll be your sister-in-law.
Stay in your limit!

41
00:04:31,167 --> 00:04:33,417
Oh, so your girl is my sister-in-law?
And my girl?

42
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:34,457
Forget it!

43
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:37,500
Okay listen, don't boil eggs
for me today; it's Tuesday.

44
00:04:37,792 --> 00:04:40,875
Friend, you're sure to get hooked.

45
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,375
She's really beautiful.

46
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:43,874
I don't understand.

47
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:45,874
There's such a beautiful girl in our city
and we don't know?

48
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:46,917
Give that to me!

49
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:49,208
Yes Mom, I'll be there in time.

50
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:51,916
What dress are you wearing?

51
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:54,625
The pink suit that Aunt Guddi
had gifted me. - Good.

52
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,917
Listen, do wear matching earrings.

53
00:04:58,042 --> 00:05:01,208
Yes Mom, I'm wearing them.
I'd worn the same earrings last time too.

54
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:03,667
Okay Mom, listen.

55
00:05:04,042 --> 00:05:05,167
Tell me.

56
00:05:05,667 --> 00:05:07,875
Try talking to Dad one last time.

57
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,083
Maybe he relents.

58
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:12,042
I'm highly qualified,
topped in my Masters. - Tea.

59
00:05:12,667 --> 00:05:14,917
I don't want to get married so soon.

60
00:05:15,042 --> 00:05:17,041
Let me study more,
become someone,

61
00:05:17,042 --> 00:05:19,250
then I'll get married to whoever
he chooses for me.

62
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:21,542
Just try talking to him
one last time, Mom.

63
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:24,333
You know he's a stubborn man.

64
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,666
I supported your move to Allahabad
to do your Masters.

65
00:05:27,667 --> 00:05:29,749
He taunts me for that to this day.

66
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:32,374
So just forget about further education.

67
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:33,624
Okay, listen,

68
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:36,417
talk nicely to the boy.

69
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:40,125
And like it's your habit,
don't laugh loudly in his presence.

70
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:42,041
Be a little coy.

71
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:45,708
Mom, don't ask me to pretend
to be shy, okay?

72
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:47,499
Just like he's coming to meet me
for a reason,

73
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,207
even I'm going to meet him
for a reason.

74
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:53,041
And if the boy is really good,
but I say I don't want to marry him,

75
00:05:53,042 --> 00:05:55,832
will Dad get me married
to him forcibly?

76
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:57,583
Aarti, is there some problem?

77
00:06:02,667 --> 00:06:04,582
What happened,
why did you fall silent?

78
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:05,750
Yes, Dad?

79
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:08,417
Have you chosen some guy
in your university?

80
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:09,792
No, Dad.

81
00:06:09,917 --> 00:06:11,625
You are such a fool.

82
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:12,999
This boy is educated.

83
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,999
He's a clerk at the Collector's office,
it's a government job.

84
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,333
The family owns a three storey house.

85
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:19,042
They are far richer than us.

86
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:22,167
I cannot find such good proposals
for you again and again.

87
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:25,583
Don't have hopes of getting a proposal
from some senior officer, you understand?

88
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:27,458
Yes, dad.

89
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:30,416
And yes, if you reject
even this proposal,

90
00:06:30,417 --> 00:06:33,292
your Jogi uncle has three
other proposals for you.

91
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,917
I have to get you married before
the year ends, you understand?

92
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:38,042
Yes, Dad.

93
00:06:38,167 --> 00:06:40,250
So just go and meet the boy.

94
00:06:40,917 --> 00:06:41,875
Yes, Dad.

95
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,833
What happened?

96
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:46,250
Nothing.

97
00:06:56,292 --> 00:06:57,833
Satyendra.
- Aarti.

98
00:06:58,667 --> 00:06:59,542
Please sit.

99
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,292
Would you like to have something?

100
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:07,500
Yes, I...
- Waiter!

101
00:07:08,917 --> 00:07:10,500
What will you have?
- Coffee.

102
00:07:11,417 --> 00:07:12,417
Get two cups coffee.

103
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Would you like to eat something with it?

104
00:07:14,542 --> 00:07:15,375
A pastry maybe?

105
00:07:16,042 --> 00:07:17,208
Cookies?
- No, thanks.

106
00:07:17,917 --> 00:07:18,542
Just two coffees.

107
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,583
Okay.

108
00:07:23,292 --> 00:07:26,333
Ask me whatever you wish to.
I'm ready for the interview.

109
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:29,083
Hey, no,
this is not an interview.

110
00:07:30,167 --> 00:07:32,750
Like I've come here to meet you for
a reason, it's the same with you.

111
00:07:34,167 --> 00:07:35,833
Even you can ask me
any questions you like.

112
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:40,708
Truly speaking,
I find this very awkward.

113
00:07:41,042 --> 00:07:43,917
How can one take a life changing
decision in half an hour?

114
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:45,500
Even I find it awkward.

115
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:47,000
[Chuckles]

116
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,916
Dad said you have a government job.

117
00:07:50,917 --> 00:07:52,833
Yes, I'm a clerk
in the excise department.

118
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:55,541
I will join next month,
I've just bagged the job.

119
00:07:55,542 --> 00:07:57,000
Excise department?

120
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:58,792
They take bribes.

121
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:01,875
You want to become rich
accepting bribes? - No.

122
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:04,708
I don't believe in accepting
or giving bribes.

123
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:06,082
That's how our system works.

124
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:08,917
Even if you refuse,
people will give it to you.

125
00:08:09,042 --> 00:08:11,750
I won't accept it.
- You won't be able to refuse.

126
00:08:12,042 --> 00:08:14,417
I'll never accept bribes.
- We'll see.

127
00:08:16,417 --> 00:08:17,583
We...
- Sir.

128
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:22,583
Ma'am.

129
00:08:24,042 --> 00:08:25,125
Thank you.
- Welcome.

130
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,958
What are your expectations
from your would-be wife?

131
00:08:30,542 --> 00:08:32,292
That she makes tea for me
when I wake up in the morning.

132
00:08:32,917 --> 00:08:34,542
Then make breakfast for me.

133
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,542
Then pack my lunch for me.

134
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,208
Just like Mom has been doing for Dad
since so many years.

135
00:08:40,417 --> 00:08:43,250
When I am back home from work,
she should be all dressed and waiting for.

136
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:45,292
She should massage my legs at night.

137
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:47,750
I have no such expectations from her.

138
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:52,500
I want a life partner
who can be my friend for life.

139
00:08:57,875 --> 00:08:59,292
I just want her to
take care of my parents,

140
00:08:59,417 --> 00:09:00,917
treat them with respect, that's all.

141
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,958
What expectations do
you have from your husband?

142
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:07,708
Dad has never let me work.

143
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,750
I've been a topper since childhood.

144
00:09:10,292 --> 00:09:13,000
My only expectation from
my husband is

145
00:09:13,292 --> 00:09:15,082
that he permits me to work.

146
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:17,208
You are so qualified,
you should put it to use.

147
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:19,667
In fact, it's good. If you also work,
we'll enjoy a double income.

148
00:09:20,042 --> 00:09:22,042
And I won't even have to accept bribes.
- [Laughs]

149
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:27,333
I have one more expectation.

150
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:28,708
This is a tough one.

151
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:29,792
Tell me.

152
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:34,124
I want my husband to take me to
the movies every week.

153
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:36,417
You're a movie buff?
- Die hard!

154
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:40,041
We'll watch the evening show
every Sunday in Sangam theater.

155
00:09:40,042 --> 00:09:41,458
You promise?
- Promise.

156
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,042
So, what next?

157
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:55,125
Choose a finger.

158
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:58,333
This one?

159
00:09:59,542 --> 00:10:01,458
I'll call my parents in the evening.

160
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:04,042
I'll give them my consent for marriage.
- [Laughs]

161
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:06,000
You like me so much?

162
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:10,125
Why only me,
anybody will like you.

163
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:13,458
I hope you don't choose somebody else.

164
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:16,083
Even I'll call my mom in the evening.

165
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:21,042
Shall I tell you something?

166
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:24,167
Pink suits you a lot.

167
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:26,167
Thank you.

168
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,458
Satyendra,

169
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,250
what did the other finger hold?

170
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:30,792
In the restaurant,
you asked me to...

171
00:10:31,042 --> 00:10:31,833
Oh that?

172
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:36,333
Instead of evening, I would go to the
men's room right away, call mom

173
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:38,000
and tell her I want to marry you.
- [Laughs]

174
00:10:41,042 --> 00:10:43,375
If you don't mind,
can I tell you something?

175
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:44,625
Tell me.

176
00:10:45,292 --> 00:10:47,250
I'll never mind anything you say.

177
00:10:49,667 --> 00:10:52,375
It's not akward, it's awkward.

178
00:10:53,042 --> 00:10:54,875
Huh? Did I say akward?

179
00:10:55,167 --> 00:10:55,917
Okay.

180
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:59,583
We are going to get married now,
nothing will be akward anymore.

181
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:00,500
Awkward.

182
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:03,042
Awk...

183
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:05,167
Awk...

184
00:11:05,792 --> 00:11:06,375
A...

185
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:07,167
...ward.

186
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:08,833
kward

187
00:11:09,042 --> 00:11:11,083
Kward... awkward.

188
00:11:11,417 --> 00:11:13,333
I know. I'll learn gradually.

189
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,625
You want curd?
- Greetings, uncle.

190
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:16,917
Come here.

191
00:11:18,667 --> 00:11:19,750
Bravo!

192
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:22,083
If you want to seek blessings,
bow down properly.

193
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:24,042
Don't just pretend to bow.

194
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,833
Come on, bow down again.

195
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:29,167
That's better. Bless you.

196
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:32,374
Now tell me,
prepared for the competitive exams?

197
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:34,707
I'm preparing.
I'll do well by your grace.

198
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:36,292
How will blessings help?

199
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,082
Greetings, aunt.
- The son wants to outdo his father.

200
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:40,417
I'm very hungry, aunt.
- Sit down.

201
00:11:40,542 --> 00:11:42,875
His ancestors sold cutlery,

202
00:11:43,042 --> 00:11:44,792
while he's out to become an officer.

203
00:11:45,917 --> 00:11:48,833
If your son wants to do something,
why don't you support him?

204
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,833
Once he becomes a magistrate
or collector,

205
00:11:52,417 --> 00:11:54,292
he'll make the family proud.

206
00:11:54,667 --> 00:11:55,333
Come off it!

207
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:58,042
Dad, I'll surely clear the exam next year.
- Oh, really?

208
00:11:58,167 --> 00:11:59,999
But if you make me sit at the
shop and sell cutlery

209
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,333
how will I get the time to study?

210
00:12:01,667 --> 00:12:03,042
I need to focus.

211
00:12:03,417 --> 00:12:07,042
Sure! I'll make you focus, kid,
just come home!

212
00:12:08,917 --> 00:12:11,332
Aunt, I'd told Aarti
to attempt the exam.

213
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:12,957
She topped in the
Masters exam last year.

214
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:14,542
I'm sure she will top the
competitive exam too.

215
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:17,083
Shall even I make one attempt
on your face?

216
00:12:18,167 --> 00:12:19,042
You fool!

217
00:12:22,792 --> 00:12:25,792
These government officer jobs
are not for girls.

218
00:12:27,167 --> 00:12:29,083
Don't give wrong advice to your sister.

219
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,083
By the way, that proposal
for Aarti is very good.

220
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:38,333
So when do you want
to come and meet Mr. Mishra?

221
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,542
They've called us at
3 O' clock tomorrow.

222
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:43,500
Be here at sharp two,
don't be late.

223
00:12:43,667 --> 00:12:45,749
Arrange a bottle for me here,
brother-in-law,

224
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,041
and I won't leave.

225
00:12:47,042 --> 00:12:48,458
[Laughs]

226
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:50,500
You'll never change.

227
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:53,708
I spoke to Mahesh.

228
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,792
Some members of the Shukla family
will come to meet us tomorrow.

229
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:57,833
Okay.

230
00:13:02,792 --> 00:13:03,417
Shanti.

231
00:13:06,542 --> 00:13:08,333
I spoke to Sattu.

232
00:13:09,167 --> 00:13:10,792
We both have decided

233
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,167
that we won't accept any dowry.

234
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:17,125
If we don't accept any dowry,
how will we conduct the marriage?

235
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:18,833
What do you mean?

236
00:13:19,042 --> 00:13:19,667
I mean,

237
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:23,042
will we be able to find a groom for
Poonam who won't accept dowry from us?

238
00:13:24,417 --> 00:13:25,083
No, right?

239
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,583
How can we agree to marriage
without dowry?

240
00:13:27,917 --> 00:13:29,750
We won't be able to save enough
from what you earn

241
00:13:29,917 --> 00:13:32,083
to be able to find an
officer groom for Poonam.

242
00:13:33,292 --> 00:13:35,167
Besides, we have not
made this tradition.

243
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:39,125
The dowry we get for Sattu, we'll add
some more to it and give it to Poonam.

244
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:41,458
Poonam is still two years away
from marriageable age.

245
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:44,000
Yes, and in two years,
dowry demand for her will double.

246
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:49,083
Okay, stop worrying about that
and have your milk, it's turning cold.

247
00:13:50,417 --> 00:13:53,667
I've spoken to Mahesh,
he will come at 2:30pm.

248
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:55,583
I know you will not talk frankly.

249
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:57,917
We need someone worldly wise
to do the talking.

250
00:13:58,917 --> 00:14:01,042
Come on now, drink your milk
and go to bed.

251
00:14:05,042 --> 00:14:08,083
Sister and you have planned and decided
to give dowry of up to Rs.1200,000.

252
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:11,124
I think the boy and the family,
both are good.

253
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:14,542
Even if they demand Rs.15,00,000,
don't reject the proposal.

254
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:17,957
No, I can only pay Rs.12,00,000.

255
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:20,500
And I'll stick to that figure.
You please don't butt in there.

256
00:14:20,792 --> 00:14:21,750
Rs.25,00,000.

257
00:14:25,667 --> 00:14:27,957
Rs.25,00,000 is a small amount
in today's times.

258
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:30,458
We cannot accept anything less
than that for my nephew's marriage.

259
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:36,000
Shall we leave, brother-in-law?

260
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:40,500
Shall we leave?
- Wait, let me talk.

261
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,833
What leave? Have we come
here to leave just like that?

262
00:14:44,417 --> 00:14:47,625
Mr. Mishra, I have a small plot
in Kanpur.

263
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:49,832
I will get about Rs. 300,000-400,000
if I sell it.

264
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:53,041
I've also saved some money
especially for Aarti's marriage.

265
00:14:53,042 --> 00:14:56,125
For the remaining amount, I'm going to
take a personal loan from the bank.

266
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:58,500
I want to get my daughter
married into your family.

267
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:01,250
Please don't embarrass me.

268
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:04,916
You give your daughter whatever you want.

269
00:15:04,917 --> 00:15:07,333
This is just an old tradition,
- [Clears throat]

270
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:09,500
or I'm against...
- Hold it, brother-in-law.

271
00:15:09,917 --> 00:15:10,750
Let me talk.

272
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:13,667
I'm doing all the talking, okay?

273
00:15:14,792 --> 00:15:18,500
Look, my nephew is the only son.

274
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:21,042
He's the sole heir to
this three storey house.

275
00:15:21,542 --> 00:15:24,792
He's also bagged a government job now
in the excise department. - Indeed.

276
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:26,917
And my brother-in-law,

277
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,249
he's been working as a professor
with the University.

278
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:30,917
Hey, why are you...

279
00:15:31,042 --> 00:15:32,917
They have every right
to demand that kind of dowry.

280
00:15:34,042 --> 00:15:37,167
We will get him married only
if we get a good dowry, or else...

281
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:39,583
We are sorry, sir.

282
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:45,417
Rs.25,00,000 is simply
beyond our capacity.

283
00:15:47,042 --> 00:15:50,375
Mr. Jogi, you don't understand math?
- Huh?

284
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:53,916
We have an offer of Rs.40,00,000.

285
00:15:53,917 --> 00:15:56,458
Oh!
- Yes, Rs.40,00,000.

286
00:15:57,917 --> 00:16:00,416
It's just that our Sattu
likes your daughter.

287
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:04,042
Or we wouldn't accept dowry
a penny less than that. - True.

288
00:16:04,417 --> 00:16:06,791
You showed an interest,
that's why we waited.

289
00:16:06,792 --> 00:16:09,875
Or by today evening, we would have
finalised his marriage to somebody else.

290
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,667
Sister, give me their number.
Where is my phone?

291
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:15,582
Let's go, brother-in-law. They are
meeting another family in the evening

292
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:17,042
who is giving them Rs.40,00,000.
Let's go.

293
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,042
I told you not to talk too much.

294
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:20,208
We can't leave.

295
00:16:24,667 --> 00:16:27,541
Mr. Mishra, you are a learned man,
worldly wise.

296
00:16:27,542 --> 00:16:30,792
You realise what kind of
money I can afford.

297
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,541
I am working as a BDO,

298
00:16:32,542 --> 00:16:36,500
but I have never taken a
penny's bribe in my entire life.

299
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:39,499
You tell me,
what is your final demand?

300
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,957
Mr. Shukla, I am...

301
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,999
Mr. Shukla is demanding
as per his status.

302
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,833
To finalise this proposal, we demand
dowry of Rs.2500,000, not a penny less!

303
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:49,916
You get that?

304
00:16:49,917 --> 00:16:52,125
We want Rs.1800,000 in cash,
Rs.700,000 worth of goods

305
00:16:52,542 --> 00:16:54,292
and this is our final decision.

306
00:16:54,417 --> 00:16:57,249
It's also the decision
of my sister and brother-in-law.

307
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:59,958
We cannot finalise this marriage
for anything less than this amount.

308
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:03,667
Shall we leave now,

309
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:06,083
brother-in-law?

310
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I accept the proposal, Mr. Mishra.

311
00:17:19,042 --> 00:17:21,292
We will honor your demand.

312
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:24,542
Please don't fold your hands
before me.

313
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,249
Shanti, get sweets!

314
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,249
[Laughs]

315
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,750
We are relatives now.
Congratulations!

316
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,750
You exercise your might
only on me.

317
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:37,625
'Mr. Mishra,
we will honor your demand.'

318
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:40,042
How will you arrange the
extra Rs.13,00,000?

319
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:43,250
I won't find a good groom for my daughter
for dowry less than this anywhere.

320
00:17:43,917 --> 00:17:46,666
I will take a loan before
my retirement,

321
00:17:46,667 --> 00:17:48,249
and repay it gradually over the years.

322
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:51,750
At least my daughter will get
married into a family of her choice;

323
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:55,500
I gave consent on that thought.

324
00:18:25,292 --> 00:18:27,458
Shall I say something?

325
00:18:28,292 --> 00:18:30,500
You look like Juhi Chawla in pink.

326
00:18:31,042 --> 00:18:32,500
[Chuckles]

327
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:36,000
And you look like Shahrukh Khan
in every color you wear.

328
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:37,250
Really?

329
00:18:38,167 --> 00:18:39,082
Shahrukh Mishra?

330
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:40,250
[Laughs]

331
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:42,625
Let's go.

332
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:48,375
Shall I move?

333
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:52,083
[Music]

334
00:19:01,042 --> 00:19:03,832

Huh?
- Our honeymoon?

370
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:13,708
I want to go to
some place very cold.

371
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:18,708

We should go to Mussoorie!

Just once, I want to go
on a drinking binge with my husband

377

and get really high.

378
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,832
I've never had alcohol.

379
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:41,416
But I've seen it in films.

380
00:22:41,417 --> 00:22:43,875
And I think it could
be a lot of fun.

381
00:22:45,042 --> 00:22:47,583
I've seen how the hero
gets the heroine drunk

382
00:22:47,708 --> 00:22:49,417

What choice was on the other finger?

398
00:23:31,917 --> 00:23:32,667
Barandy.

buy those. See this.

- Son, girls wear red shades.

I don't hide anything from him,
nor does he hide anything from me.

We are best friends.
Even you don't hide anything from Sattu.

00:26:19,208 --> 00:26:20,125
I won't.

453
00:26:20,292 --> 00:26:24,417
I've already told him I want us to get
totally drunk on our honeymoon.

454
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:27,667
Oh, you are two steps
ahead of me.

455
00:26:28,042 --> 00:26:29,208
So what did he say?

456
00:26:29,333 --> 00:26:33,000
He's more excited than me.
He's never had alcohol before.

Sis, he's really cute.

458
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,042
Aarti, I have learnt that only two things
are most important in a marriage.

459
00:26:40,333 --> 00:26:41,208
And what are those?

460
00:26:41,458 --> 00:26:43,541
Lots of love and lots of money.

And let you listen in?
I'm not a fool.

470
00:27:01,333 --> 00:27:04,041
I know what he's going to say,
you put it on speaker.

471

You will remain silent?
- Not a word!

- Happy birthday.

475

Okay, listen wife,
I want to meet you.

476
00:27:21,458 --> 00:27:24,083
Meet me at the temple tomorrow.

477
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,250
There is a room behind it.
- Huh?

478
00:27:26,708 --> 00:27:28,083
We'll meet there.

479
00:27:28,208 --> 00:27:30,792
I'll hit you if you go.
- I won't.

480
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,375
Why will we meet in a room?

481
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:35,500
Hey no, don't misunderstand.

482
00:27:35,625 --> 00:27:39,208
Huh? - That we can indulge in
after marriage at home.

483
00:27:41,083 --> 00:27:42,750
I've not seen you since so many days.

484

I want to see you so desperately!

485
00:27:45,292 --> 00:27:47,083
I'm finding it difficult
to survive without you.

486
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:50,958
I will not come.
- All right, tomorrow 4pm. Bye!

487
00:27:51,583 --> 00:27:53,958

I love this guy!
He's so romantic! Move!

490
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:04,042
Sis!
- He's so romantic!

491
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:07,042
He's great!
From two, you already have one thing.

492
00:28:07,583 --> 00:28:09,500
Your love life will be great.

493
00:28:09,833 --> 00:28:12,208
He'll be into you.
- Sis!

494
00:28:12,667 --> 00:28:16,083
And I'm already imagining that.
- You're so disgusting, sis!

495
00:28:16,875 --> 00:28:19,333
But one thing is amiss.
- What?

496
00:28:19,458 --> 00:28:22,500
I think he is miserly.
- Why?

497
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:27,625
Just think, does one call
his would be wife to a temple?

498
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:31,875
There are so many five-star hotels.
He could have booked a room there.

499
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,250
What, he'll make you toll the bell
in the temple? - Come on, sis!

500
00:28:34,375 --> 00:28:37,999
I don't know all that.
I'll be there before 4pm.

501
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,999
My poor man is finding it difficult
to survive without me.

502
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,375
It'll give him a breather
until our marriage.

503
00:28:44,583 --> 00:28:46,583
But get this clear.

504
00:28:47,042 --> 00:28:49,875
Don't let him touch you.
Men are fools.

505
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,542
First, he'll make a move
and then doubt your character.

506
00:28:52,667 --> 00:28:54,500
I'm just warning you.
- All right, Mom!

Thank you, Sattu.

514
00:29:40,458 --> 00:29:43,500
You did so much for me.
- This is nothing.

515
00:29:44,167 --> 00:29:46,583
I have written something for you,
shall I read it?

- Yes. Shall I read it?

It's cute. Continue.

You are God's best creation.

524

My only intent now.

525
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:08,542
Is to love you more than myself.

526
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:10,542
Sattu.

527
00:30:11,292 --> 00:30:12,042

Thank you.

00:30:19,167 --> 00:30:23,625
Pink color suits you a lot.

531
00:30:23,833 --> 00:30:26,292
Why do you think
I'm wearing pink color?

532
00:30:26,417 --> 00:30:27,500
You mean, for me?

533
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:30,292
Of course, for you.

534
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,417
There are petals in your hair.

535

I've.. I've fallen in love with you.

536
00:30:40,292 --> 00:30:42,042
Shall I say "I love you"?

537
00:30:44,167 --> 00:30:45,125
Your wish.

538
00:30:46,917 --> 00:30:48,042
Okay, I'll say it then.

539
00:30:50,208 --> 00:30:51,042

00:30:58,292 --> 00:31:00,250
'I also love you.'

544
00:31:01,208 --> 00:31:02,042
Say it.

545
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:03,958
Say!

546
00:31:04,917 --> 00:31:06,333
It's just three words, say them.

547
00:31:09,875 --> 00:31:10,874
I will not say anything.

548
00:31:10,875 --> 00:31:12,750
Whatever I have to say,
I'll say after marriage.

549
00:31:13,083 --> 00:31:14,042
All right.

550
00:31:15,417 --> 00:31:17,583
All right, now...

551
00:31:18,417 --> 00:31:20,750
shall I ask you something, you...
- Ask me.

552

If you don't mind?

553

One...

554
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:27,917
...can I kiss you once?

555
00:31:28,417 --> 00:31:30,125
Can I kiss you?

556
00:31:36,042 --> 00:31:37,666
How can we kiss in a temple?

557
00:31:37,667 --> 00:31:40,292
God is everywhere.
- Oh, really?

558
00:31:40,625 --> 00:31:43,500
I would, if you had called me
to some five-star hotel room.

559

Oh, I forgot!

560
00:31:49,208 --> 00:31:50,750
I've bought something for you.

561
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:56,167
Happy birthday!

562
00:31:56,708 --> 00:31:58,333
Bribing me, huh?

563
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:02,042
Bribing me for a kiss?
- I love you very much.

564
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,375
Then kiss me.

565
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:05,542
It's okay. Let it be.

566
00:32:05,667 --> 00:32:08,916
Why, lost the mood?
- No, I very much want to.

568
00:32:10,458 --> 00:32:11,833

00:32:12,333 --> 00:32:13,250
Shall I really?

570
00:32:15,417 --> 00:32:18,083
Shall I put this down?
- I'll hold it.

571
00:32:22,042 --> 00:32:23,583
Just one kiss, that's all.

572
00:32:28,667 --> 00:32:32,750
No! You will kiss me
and then doubt my character.

573
00:32:32,875 --> 00:32:34,917
No, I will not doubt you.

574
00:32:35,042 --> 00:32:37,042
You will.
- I swear, I won't.

575
00:32:37,167 --> 00:32:39,583
Everything after marriage now.
- I won't doubt you.

576
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:41,917
You have to wait for just one
more day, Sattu, bye!

577

I.. I will not doubt...

578
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:46,250
Sattu, it's just a small wait now.

579

Listen, send me a picture
of you as a bride.

692
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,625
There should be some
suspense at least.

693
00:40:28,958 --> 00:40:33,042
I want to see you, send it. - Patience!
I'm looking very hot today, by the way.

694
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:36,292
Why the suspense now,
we are almost married.

695
00:40:36,417 --> 00:40:37,792
Hang up now!

696
00:40:37,917 --> 00:40:40,458
I'm coming to take you.
- Bye!

697
00:40:40,958 --> 00:40:44,083
Should I slap you now?
Are you foolish?

698
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:47,083
You are a fool!
- I was only talking to him on the phone.

699
00:40:47,208 --> 00:40:49,708
You could have told me at least that you
have appeared for the competitive exams.

700
00:40:49,833 --> 00:40:51,667
It wasn't that important.

701
00:40:51,792 --> 00:40:54,208
It's wasn't important?
Are you crazy?

702
00:40:54,333 --> 00:40:56,625
You... - Have you two finished?
Shall I speak now?

703
00:40:57,167 --> 00:41:00,708
You've cleared the competitive exams!
You can become an officer!

704
00:41:02,708 --> 00:41:03,250
Yes.

705
00:41:04,875 --> 00:41:07,250
Your result has just come in,
I saw it online.

706
00:41:07,375 --> 00:41:09,792
I... officer...

707
00:41:10,333 --> 00:41:12,708
I can become an officer!
I have passed the exam!

708
00:41:12,875 --> 00:41:14,500
[Shouts]

709
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:19,792
I want a treat!

710
00:41:20,333 --> 00:41:20,917
I...

711
00:41:21,458 --> 00:41:24,708
Sis, people try for years
and don't get selected.

712
00:41:24,833 --> 00:41:27,957
Ranjan and I have been trying since
two years, but have failed both times.

713
00:41:27,958 --> 00:41:31,167
But she cleared the exam
at first attempt!

714
00:41:31,292 --> 00:41:35,792
It's a great achievement.
- It really is!

715
00:41:35,917 --> 00:41:39,375
Aarti, you'll have your own residence,
a car with the beacon on top!

716
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:42,042
You'll have servants around you.

717
00:41:42,167 --> 00:41:45,750
The best job in the state government,
office in the secretariat!

718
00:41:45,958 --> 00:41:49,250
And so much respect,
you won't be able to digest it.

719
00:41:49,375 --> 00:41:52,375
Everyone will take orders from you,
Officer Shukla.

720
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:57,750
Not Officer Shukla, I will be
Officer Aarti Satyendra Mishra.

721
00:41:57,875 --> 00:42:02,124
I can't believe it, sis!
I'm going to become an officer!

722
00:42:02,125 --> 00:42:05,000
Sattu is so lucky for me, sis.

723
00:42:05,125 --> 00:42:07,624
Marriage is the happiest day
of one's life.

724
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:10,167
For me, it's a day
of double celebration!

725
00:42:10,417 --> 00:42:11,792
Sis!

726
00:42:12,792 --> 00:42:16,294
"I'm ready to take bullet wounds..."
- I'll bring home your daughter-in-law.

727
00:42:16,295 --> 00:42:19,583
"...and die for love."

728
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:26,877
"I'm ready to take bullet wounds
and die for love."

729
00:42:26,878 --> 00:42:32,834
"O my darling, I won't stop chasing you."

730
00:42:32,835 --> 00:42:34,208
"No! No!"

731
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:43,042
"I'm ready to take bullet wounds
and die for love."

732
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:45,125
The groom is about to reach, hurry!
- Yes.

733
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:46,792
Keep it near the gate.
- Yes.

734
00:42:47,292 --> 00:42:49,583
Dad, come here.
- What is it?

735
00:42:49,833 --> 00:42:51,083
The groom will be here any minute.
- I want to say something important.

736
00:42:51,208 --> 00:42:52,667
Dad, don't be angry,
just listen to me first.

737
00:42:52,792 --> 00:42:54,917
Oh yes, I knew your husband
will not be able to make it.

738
00:42:55,042 --> 00:42:56,917
Where is he, tell me.
- Dad... - Listen!

739
00:42:57,042 --> 00:42:59,417
The groom is coming,
wear your coat, hurry.

740
00:42:59,750 --> 00:43:02,708
You also get ready quickly.
- Dad, listen to me, and don't be angry.

741
00:43:02,833 --> 00:43:04,875
Say it quickly,
there is no time.

742
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,708
Dad, Aarti had appeared for
the competitive exams.

743
00:43:08,833 --> 00:43:11,333
She cleared both the levels.

744
00:43:11,458 --> 00:43:12,833
She had not told us.

745
00:43:12,958 --> 00:43:16,625
She qualified in the exams?
- Yes, online results have come in.

746
00:43:18,083 --> 00:43:22,542
That's very good news.

747
00:43:22,750 --> 00:43:23,958
It's great news.

748
00:43:24,667 --> 00:43:26,375
Is Aarti ready, the groom is arriving.

749
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:28,833
Dad, you're not listening.

750
00:43:29,042 --> 00:43:32,125
She has cleared the main exam,
she can be an officer.

751
00:43:32,792 --> 00:43:35,375
From today, she is the
daughter-in-law of the Mishra family.

752
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:38,499
What she will become or not become,
what she will do or not do,

753
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:40,042
Mr. Mishra will decide now.

754
00:43:40,375 --> 00:43:41,042
All right?

755
00:43:41,792 --> 00:43:44,167
Is the welcome platter ready?

756
00:43:45,792 --> 00:43:48,041
Mom, please convince Dad,
we are making a grave mistake.

757
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:51,333
The groom is on his way.
- Aarti's mother-in-law won't let her work.

758
00:43:51,458 --> 00:43:53,541
We are making a big mistake
getting her married into this family.

759
00:43:53,542 --> 00:43:55,583
Telling your dad anything
is not going to help.

760
00:43:55,708 --> 00:43:57,458
He won't listen to anybody.
- Mom, at least you... - Manju.

761
00:43:58,125 --> 00:44:00,167
Ask her to quietly go inside.

762
00:44:01,083 --> 00:44:03,667
It's an auspicious day today, I don't
want to do anything inauspicious.

763
00:44:03,792 --> 00:44:06,500
Dad, I know you are angry,
but think calmly... - Quiet!

764
00:44:07,083 --> 00:44:08,500
Stop your nonsense!

765
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,250
Or I may raise my hand...
- What are you doing!

766
00:44:12,958 --> 00:44:15,792
She is our guest.
- Guest indeed!

767
00:44:16,083 --> 00:44:18,500
Don't say another word now.

768
00:44:18,625 --> 00:44:22,250
I will speak. Why won't I?
- Keep quiet!

769
00:44:22,375 --> 00:44:25,375
You want Aarti also to work
in the kitchen and look after kids

770
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:26,708
like Mom and me?

771
00:44:26,833 --> 00:44:28,875
She shouldn't even try
becoming an officer?

772
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,792
She cleared the exam at first attempt.

773
00:44:30,917 --> 00:44:33,832
She is so talented
and you are ruining her life.

774
00:44:33,833 --> 00:44:35,041
Why will I not protest?

775
00:44:35,042 --> 00:44:37,041
It's because of people like you
and her mother-in-law

776
00:44:37,042 --> 00:44:38,999
that girls have to live
within four walls.

777
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,000
You want me to stall this marriage
heeding your nonsense?

778
00:44:42,417 --> 00:44:44,542
You want me to tell Mr. Mishra
that my daughter can become an officer,

779
00:44:44,667 --> 00:44:46,667
so I'm calling off the marriage?
- Yes, Dad.

780
00:44:46,792 --> 00:44:48,708
Aabha.
- Stall this marriage.

781
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:53,292
She can get married later,
but she cannot become an officer later.

782
00:44:53,417 --> 00:44:55,708
Her mother-in-law has said
she won't let her work.

783
00:44:55,958 --> 00:44:58,041
She always wanted to work, Dad.

784
00:44:58,042 --> 00:44:59,917
Stall this marriage.
- Aabha, quiet.

785
00:45:00,042 --> 00:45:02,750
Manju, this girl has gone nuts.

786
00:45:03,167 --> 00:45:06,667
Get her out of my sight
or I'll hit her.

787
00:45:06,792 --> 00:45:08,292
I may do something untoward.
- Don't say that.

788
00:45:08,417 --> 00:45:10,207
You are doing something
terribly untoward.

789
00:45:10,208 --> 00:45:12,167
You are doing something terribly
untoward with Aarti's life.

790
00:45:12,292 --> 00:45:14,042
Aabha, keep quiet.

791
00:45:14,708 --> 00:45:18,042
I'm doing something untoward with
Aarti's life? - She doesn't mean that.

792
00:45:18,167 --> 00:45:19,708
Listen to me carefully.

793
00:45:19,833 --> 00:45:22,333
You are settled in life,
let your sister settle down too.

794
00:45:22,458 --> 00:45:24,333
Don't try to be the boss of my house.

795
00:45:24,458 --> 00:45:26,457
Mom, convince him.
- Enough!

796
00:45:26,458 --> 00:45:28,167
Please, quiet.
- Enough!

797
00:45:28,417 --> 00:45:29,167
Enough.

798
00:45:29,625 --> 00:45:32,208
Pick up your bags and leave! [Snaps finger]
- Quiet! What...

799
00:45:32,333 --> 00:45:34,875
We can get Aarti married
without your presence. Leave!

800
00:45:35,292 --> 00:45:37,333
Dad, listen to me...
- Leave, I said!

801
00:45:38,125 --> 00:45:40,083
How can you...
Aabha, wait.

802
00:45:40,833 --> 00:45:43,208
[Music]

803
00:45:50,333 --> 00:45:51,500
[Line ringing]

804
00:45:54,375 --> 00:45:57,249
"I came out on the streets
with my vehicle."

805
00:45:57,250 --> 00:46:00,749
"There came a turn in the journey"

806
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:03,625
"where I left my heart behind."

807
00:46:04,375 --> 00:46:06,291
"There came a turn in the journey"

808
00:46:06,292 --> 00:46:09,000
"where I left my heart behind."

809
00:46:25,292 --> 00:46:26,499
What happened, sis?

810
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:29,042
I just messaged Sattu.
Is everything okay?

811
00:46:29,292 --> 00:46:31,625
What happened?
- Listen carefully to what I have to say.

812
00:46:32,042 --> 00:46:33,875
When I went to your in-laws
house today morning,

813
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,957
I told her you want to work after
marriage, she flatly refused.

814
00:46:37,958 --> 00:46:40,083
She said daughters-in-law in the
Mishra family don't take up jobs.

815
00:46:40,333 --> 00:46:42,833
How can she say that?
Sattu himself told me...

816
00:46:42,958 --> 00:46:45,167
I told her you have spoken
to Sattu about it.

817
00:46:45,292 --> 00:46:46,457
You know what she said?

818
00:46:46,458 --> 00:46:48,666
That Sattu is young,
and that she still buys his underwear.

819
00:46:48,667 --> 00:46:50,500
You understand what that means?

820
00:46:50,625 --> 00:46:53,667
She didn't tell me this,
she meant it for you.

821
00:46:53,792 --> 00:46:59,875
Remember, you will never be able
to take up a job in that house.

822
00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:02,208
Then why did Sattu tell me...

823
00:47:02,333 --> 00:47:04,292
How does what Sattu said matter?

824
00:47:05,042 --> 00:47:07,042
He will not be able to
go against his mother.

825
00:47:07,292 --> 00:47:09,375
Now you decide what you want to do.

826
00:47:10,042 --> 00:47:13,041
Sis, I cannot be just a housewife.

827
00:47:13,042 --> 00:47:15,167
I do want to marry Sattu.

828
00:47:15,292 --> 00:47:19,042
But I'd told him on our first meeting
that I want to work and he had agreed.

829
00:47:19,458 --> 00:47:22,125
I cannot be just a housewife.

830
00:47:23,958 --> 00:47:26,042
Sis, I'll talk to Sattu.

831
00:47:26,167 --> 00:47:28,333
Why do you want to talk to Sattu?

832
00:47:28,458 --> 00:47:30,875
He's my future husband.
- He's a clerk!

833
00:47:32,833 --> 00:47:36,667
When you become officer, a dozen
clerks like Sattu will work under you.

834
00:47:37,583 --> 00:47:40,250
I'm not saying he's bad,
he's a very good guy.

835
00:47:40,375 --> 00:47:43,042
But he won't understand
even if he wants to, Aarti.

836
00:47:51,833 --> 00:47:53,042
What should I do?

837
00:47:53,417 --> 00:47:55,042
What do you mean
what should you do?

838
00:47:55,167 --> 00:47:58,833
Look at me. Mother-in-law, father-in-law,
husband, kids, three meals

839
00:47:58,958 --> 00:48:00,833
that no one cares about.

840
00:48:01,417 --> 00:48:04,042
And on the other hand,
respect and independence,

841
00:48:04,208 --> 00:48:07,167
and a life you have earned.
Just think!

842
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:09,333
Your future is calling you, Aarti.

843
00:48:09,625 --> 00:48:12,208
Just think, why did your
results come in today?

844
00:48:12,333 --> 00:48:14,583
They could have come tomorrow,
after you were married.

845
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,917
Right? You couldn't have done
anything then. But you can today.

846
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:20,000
Run away. Run away!

847
00:48:21,333 --> 00:48:23,791
I'll call my husband,
he'll handle everything.

848
00:48:23,792 --> 00:48:25,917
You go to Banaras
to my house with him.

849
00:48:26,250 --> 00:48:53,292
"Dark glasses suit your fair face."

850
00:48:53,583 --> 00:48:55,292
I cannot do this to Sattu.

851
00:48:55,667 --> 00:48:57,917
And you can do it to yourself?

852
00:48:58,333 --> 00:49:00,208
My husband and I are with you, Aarti.

853
00:49:00,333 --> 00:49:03,042
Just run away.
No one will heed you here.

854
00:49:03,542 --> 00:49:04,625
Run away.

855
00:49:05,042 --> 00:49:09,292
Once you become officer,
Dad, Sattu, everyone will relent.

856
00:49:11,125 --> 00:49:11,958
Aarti.

857
00:49:15,208 --> 00:49:17,167
Aarti, it's very...

858
00:49:35,375 --> 00:49:37,250
What do you want, child?

859
00:49:38,958 --> 00:49:42,208
[Sobbing]

860
00:49:45,333 --> 00:49:46,833
Dad, Sattu?

861
00:49:47,167 --> 00:49:48,500
I'll handle them.

862
00:49:50,708 --> 00:49:52,125
You want to become officer?

863
00:49:55,792 --> 00:49:56,833
Then run away.

864
00:49:57,125 --> 00:49:59,667
Uncle...
- There is no other option, dear.

865
00:50:01,042 --> 00:50:02,875
Society is like that.

866
00:50:03,292 --> 00:50:05,750
It treats men royally.

867
00:50:05,875 --> 00:50:08,625
But no one respects women.

868
00:50:08,750 --> 00:50:12,042
Nor does it want to give them
a life of their choice.

869
00:50:12,250 --> 00:50:14,832
So whenever a daughter
gets the opportunity,

870
00:50:14,833 --> 00:50:18,292
to live a life of her choice
holding her head high,

871
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:21,792
she must cross all hurdles and leave.

872
00:50:23,208 --> 00:50:25,375
Run away, child. Leave.

873
00:50:27,875 --> 00:50:29,417
I am with you.

874
00:50:33,417 --> 00:50:35,333
[Music]

875
00:50:44,167 --> 00:50:47,167
Aarti, leave, the groom is almost here.
Even I have to go down.

876
00:50:47,292 --> 00:50:48,999
Someone may come.
No one should know. Leave!

877
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,125
I can't do it, sis.
Dad will kill me.

878
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:52,542
I won't be able to do it.

879
00:50:52,833 --> 00:50:56,041
Aarti! Uncle will handle
everything; he told you.

880
00:50:56,042 --> 00:50:59,749
Just remember that uncle will say you
heard about the dowry and ran away. Come!

881
00:50:59,750 --> 00:51:02,207
Sis, how is Sattu at fault?

882
00:51:02,208 --> 00:51:05,250
He loves me very much.
- You will find love again.

883
00:51:05,667 --> 00:51:08,208
You won't get the opportunity to
become officer again. Come! - Sis.

884
00:51:08,333 --> 00:51:12,166
Let me talk to him just once.
- No Aarti, not now.

885
00:51:12,167 --> 00:51:14,332
And don't talk to him
until I don't tell you to.

886
00:51:14,333 --> 00:51:16,417
If they come to know the
reason why you ran away,

887
00:51:16,542 --> 00:51:19,042
they will blame you solely for it. Come.
- Sis, just once.

888
00:51:20,208 --> 00:51:21,833
Come quickly.

889
00:51:22,583 --> 00:51:24,583
Aabha, the groom has arrived.

890
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:39,250
Aabha, where is the platter of sweets?
- Mom.

891
00:51:42,042 --> 00:51:44,458
[Crying]

892
00:51:53,958 --> 00:51:56,250
Your brother-in-law is waiting at the
back door for you. Go.

893
00:51:58,083 --> 00:51:59,625
Come. Come.

894
00:52:01,583 --> 00:52:03,125
Good luck! Go quickly.

895
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:08,083
[Music]

896
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:28,125
[Crying]

897
00:53:41,250 --> 00:53:44,125
Congratulations!
- To you too!

898
00:54:00,833 --> 00:54:03,542
Hey! What are you doing?
- Where is Aarti?

899
00:54:06,542 --> 00:54:10,042
Where is Aarti?
I'm asking you something.

900
00:54:12,042 --> 00:54:14,082
She didn't want to get married, Dad.

901
00:54:14,083 --> 00:54:17,542
She didn't want to get married or you
didn't want it? - What are you doing?

902
00:54:18,208 --> 00:54:21,250
You are hitting your married daughter?
- Move aside!

903
00:54:21,375 --> 00:54:22,542
Move aside!

904
00:54:23,083 --> 00:54:26,458
What should I do if not hit her?
Worship her?

905
00:54:27,292 --> 00:54:31,500
Don't hit her,
she's your married daughter.

906
00:54:31,625 --> 00:54:32,917
The groom is here.

907
00:54:38,375 --> 00:54:41,957
Where has she gone?
She must have told you!

908
00:54:41,958 --> 00:54:45,583
She must have told you!
- I don't know, Dad.

909
00:54:45,708 --> 00:54:48,542
Sorry, Dad. Sorry, Dad. [Crying]

910
00:54:49,667 --> 00:54:51,417
Sorry, Dad.

911
00:54:53,625 --> 00:54:57,167
Educate your daughter even more!

912
00:54:58,333 --> 00:54:59,958
Send her to Allahabad
for further education.

913
00:55:00,458 --> 00:55:02,542
You cannot handle a young girl?

914
00:55:04,625 --> 00:55:06,042
Why did I invite her?

915
00:55:06,667 --> 00:55:08,583
She's brought me disgrace.

916
00:55:09,667 --> 00:55:12,792
Uncle, why are you getting angry on her?

917
00:55:12,917 --> 00:55:16,292
I have not managed to clear
the exams, but Aarti did.

918
00:55:16,625 --> 00:55:20,625
If I could,
I would kill both of them.

919
00:55:22,375 --> 00:55:25,292
And immolate myself too.
- Don't say that.

920
00:55:25,875 --> 00:55:27,625
I've been disgraced!

921
00:55:29,375 --> 00:55:31,750
My honor is in smithereens!

922
00:55:40,792 --> 00:55:42,167
Come here.

923
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:43,792
Come.

924
00:55:48,125 --> 00:55:50,208
I understand your pain,
brother-in-law.

925
00:55:50,792 --> 00:55:52,208
This is a moment of crisis.

926
00:55:53,042 --> 00:55:55,375
And we have to get out
of it somehow.

927
00:55:55,833 --> 00:55:58,792
Don't think of the
society right now.

928
00:55:59,167 --> 00:56:03,208
Think of how to recover Rs.1800,000
cash that we have given them.

929
00:56:06,417 --> 00:56:07,917
Tell me, what should I do?

930
00:56:08,542 --> 00:56:11,500
'Sorry Mr. Mishra,
forgive me for this.'

931
00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:14,083
'My daughter has run away.'

932
00:56:15,458 --> 00:56:18,957
'But please return the money
I gave you.'

933
00:56:18,958 --> 00:56:19,792
Is this what I'll say?

934
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,917
See! You don't understand.

935
00:56:23,167 --> 00:56:27,917
If Mahesh learns that Aarti has run away,
he won't return us a penny.

936
00:56:28,375 --> 00:56:31,208
They will keep your life's savings.

937
00:56:36,833 --> 00:56:40,792
So how do we make
them return the money?

938
00:56:40,917 --> 00:56:43,250
We'll have to make them return it.

939
00:56:44,042 --> 00:56:46,208
I beg you, brother-in-law,

940
00:56:46,583 --> 00:56:49,958
let me handle this now.

941
00:56:50,208 --> 00:56:52,375
Just remain silent in their presence.

942
00:56:58,958 --> 00:57:01,167
We'll have tea,
but first tell us what is the matter?

943
00:57:03,042 --> 00:57:04,083
Why have you called us here?

944
00:57:05,208 --> 00:57:06,167
Mr. Mishra,

945
00:57:07,792 --> 00:57:09,417
well, actually,

946
00:57:11,042 --> 00:57:13,208
a very big crisis

947
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:16,000
has befallen upon us and you.

948
00:57:16,208 --> 00:57:17,874
Crisis?
- Yes.

949
00:57:17,875 --> 00:57:19,292
Mr. Jogi, what is the matter?

950
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:23,583
Well, actually Aarti...

951
00:57:24,625 --> 00:57:25,583
What happened?

952
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:29,625
When we went to her room just now,
she was not there.

953
00:57:30,083 --> 00:57:31,166
What do you mean?

954
00:57:31,167 --> 00:57:33,542
We only found this letter.

955
00:57:34,542 --> 00:57:35,708
Let me see.

956
00:57:36,542 --> 00:57:37,625
Read it.

957
00:57:40,833 --> 00:57:46,500
As soon as she came to know that you
demanded Rs. 25,00,000 dowry from us,

958
00:57:46,625 --> 00:57:51,083
she decided not to get married
into your family.

959
00:57:51,750 --> 00:57:54,541
And she left the house.
- Where did she go?

960
00:57:54,542 --> 00:57:57,249
How do we know where she went?
- Let me talk to her.

961
00:57:57,250 --> 00:57:59,332
We are unable to reach her,
how can we help you?

962
00:57:59,333 --> 00:58:00,166
How can you say that, Mr. Shukla?

963
00:58:00,167 --> 00:58:03,792
Whatever was finalised was
with the consent of both families.

964
00:58:04,042 --> 00:58:07,000
Mr. Jogi, I know this is not
about dowry.

965
00:58:07,208 --> 00:58:10,375
I'm sorry, Sattu,
I'd kept something from you.

966
00:58:10,708 --> 00:58:12,624
I'd appeared for the
competitive exam.

967
00:58:12,625 --> 00:58:14,749
The result came in today
and I have cleared the exam.

968
00:58:14,750 --> 00:58:16,207
I'm going to become an officer.

969
00:58:16,208 --> 00:58:18,124
You'd sent her to
Allahabad for higher education.

970
00:58:18,125 --> 00:58:21,249
She must have fallen for
someone over there.

971
00:58:21,250 --> 00:58:25,207
Your daughter disgraced your family honor
and ran away from home.

972
00:58:25,208 --> 00:58:29,541
Go buy black paint
and rub it over your faces now!

973
00:58:29,542 --> 00:58:32,041
Mind your tongue, Mahesh!
- Or what will you do?

974
00:58:32,042 --> 00:58:33,708
What will we do?

975
00:58:36,250 --> 00:58:37,707
I don't want to talk to you.

976
00:58:37,708 --> 00:58:40,999
Mr. Mishra, you are an educated man.

977
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,208
I'm folding my hands
and telling you

978
00:58:43,333 --> 00:58:47,250
that our daughter doesn't want to have
anything to do with your family now.

979
00:58:47,417 --> 00:58:51,792
So please return our Rs. 18,00,000
cash to us without a fuss.

980
00:58:52,292 --> 00:58:56,625
And return peacefully with your guests.

981
00:58:56,750 --> 00:58:57,916
This marriage stands cancelled.

982
00:58:57,917 --> 00:59:00,000
This is not a train ticket
that you are cancelling it.

983
00:59:00,542 --> 00:59:02,916
Your daughter has run away and
you are asking us to return the money?

984
00:59:02,917 --> 00:59:04,875
Have some shame.
You think this is a joke?

985
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,457
We won't refund a penny.

986
00:59:06,458 --> 00:59:08,292

987
00:59:14,583 --> 00:59:17,083
[Crying]

988
00:59:17,625 --> 00:59:20,249
We won't refund a penny.
Let's go!

989
00:59:20,250 --> 00:59:22,832
Oh, really?
It's not a piece of cake.

990
00:59:22,833 --> 00:59:26,374
Don't even think of leaving
from here without refunding our money.

991
00:59:26,375 --> 00:59:27,957
What can you do?

992
00:59:27,958 --> 00:59:30,999
Brij, Chandu, Keshav,
close the doors!

993
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:34,207
Ranjan, get it out.
Aim it at his head...

994
00:59:34,208 --> 00:59:37,042
Don't threaten me. I'm not afraid.
- You cannot leave!

995
00:59:37,708 --> 00:59:39,916
Rs.18,00,000.
- Come on, shoot!

996
00:59:39,917 --> 00:59:45,083
Until I don't have every penny back,
I won't let you leave from here.

997
00:59:45,542 --> 00:59:49,666
Come on, shoot him!
Pump 25 bullets into him.

998
00:59:49,667 --> 00:59:52,208
I'll shoot him, Dad.
- He demanded Rs. 25,00,000.

999
00:59:52,333 --> 00:59:55,749
I'm standing before you,
shoot me!

1000
00:59:55,750 --> 00:59:58,666
Sit down, Mr. Mishra.
- Don't touch him!

1001
00:59:58,667 --> 01:00:01,542
And until you don't
hand me the money...

1002
01:00:01,667 --> 01:00:06,167
Dad, Aarti is gone. She's gone.
- What do you mean? Where did she go?

1003
01:00:06,292 --> 01:00:07,083
Let it be.

1004
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:10,625
I'll return your money.

1005
01:00:12,083 --> 01:00:14,500
Don't do anything to my dad and uncle.

1006
01:00:17,042 --> 01:00:17,917
I'll get the money.

1007
01:00:19,417 --> 01:00:20,833
I'll be back.
- Son?

1008
01:00:38,708 --> 01:00:40,125
Aarti!

1009
01:00:41,875 --> 01:00:43,000
Aarti!

1010
01:00:45,083 --> 01:00:48,333
Aar... did you see Aarti?
- Huh? No.

1011
01:00:53,042 --> 01:00:54,458
Aarti!

1012
01:01:04,625 --> 01:01:07,333
Sis, where is Aarti?

1013
01:01:08,125 --> 01:01:10,708
I'm trying to call her since so long,
she's not answering my calls.

1014
01:01:12,417 --> 01:01:13,417
Where is she?

1015
01:01:16,583 --> 01:01:19,458
You two take the guests
and go back home.

1016
01:01:19,583 --> 01:01:21,292
Huh? What happened, Sattu?

1017
01:01:21,417 --> 01:01:22,624
I'll tell you later...
- What happened, brother?

1018
01:01:22,625 --> 01:01:23,625
you take everyone and go home.
- Sattu...

1019
01:01:23,917 --> 01:01:24,625
But...

1020

Why did this happen?

1027
01:02:38,458 --> 01:02:42,917
Where is your dad and uncle?
- They are fine, don't worry.

1028
01:02:43,375 --> 01:02:46,292
Don't cry.
- Bring them back.

1029
01:02:47,375 --> 01:02:50,292
Where is the money?
I have to take back the money.

1030
01:02:51,083 --> 01:02:55,333
We spent Rs. 8,00,000,
I have the balance Rs. 10,00,000.

1031
01:02:55,458 --> 01:02:58,000
Take the Rs. 10,00,000
and get them freed quickly.

1032
01:02:58,250 --> 01:03:00,082
They won't accept only Rs. 10,00,000,
they want the full amount.

1033
01:03:00,083 --> 01:03:03,000
We will pay them later.
- They will not relent.

1034
01:03:04,917 --> 01:03:07,582
Where will we get money
from at this hour?

[Crying]

1036
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,833
I'd saved this for Poonam's marriage.

1037
01:03:36,792 --> 01:03:39,500
I wore this when I got married.

1038
01:03:44,083 --> 01:03:47,042
I curse that girl
for doing this to us.

1039
01:03:47,583 --> 01:03:50,500
She ruined our life and ran away.

1041
01:03:57,917 --> 01:04:01,500
Hello. Sis?
- They just left.

1042
01:04:01,625 --> 01:04:03,500
They returned all the money to dad.

1043
01:04:04,208 --> 01:04:05,458
Is Dad all right?

1044
01:04:05,708 --> 01:04:06,833
He's not all right.

1045
01:04:06,958 --> 01:04:08,458
Uncle is with him.

1046
01:04:08,917 --> 01:04:11,667
He will stay here for a few days
until everything settles down.

1047
01:04:12,833 --> 01:04:14,875
Did Sattu call you?

1048
01:04:15,292 --> 01:04:17,957
He did, he called many times.

1049
01:04:17,958 --> 01:04:20,125
But like you had said,
I didn't answer.

1050
01:04:21,208 --> 01:04:24,417
Sis, can I call him once, please?

1051
01:04:24,833 --> 01:04:28,000
Yes, talk to him.
He's very hurt.

1052
01:04:28,208 --> 01:04:31,458
In all this, just one mistake happened;
he got hurt.

1053
01:04:32,625 --> 01:04:34,208
I saw him.

1054
01:04:46,667 --> 01:04:48,958
Stop. Stop the car.

[Brakes squeal]

1056
01:04:52,542 --> 01:04:53,667
What happened?

1057
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:55,500
Sattu, look at him.

1058
01:04:56,583 --> 01:04:57,583
Brother-in-law.

1059
01:05:01,125 --> 01:05:02,000
Dad.

1060
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:04,750
Dad.

1061
01:05:05,625 --> 01:05:06,625
I won't die, son.

1062
01:05:07,792 --> 01:05:08,875
I won't die.

1063
01:05:09,750 --> 01:05:11,208
I'm not so weak.

1064
01:05:13,208 --> 01:05:16,500
I was just feeling a little suffocated.

1065
01:05:16,625 --> 01:05:19,958
Open your buttons.
- Wait.

1066
01:05:24,167 --> 01:05:25,125
I...

1067
01:05:27,917 --> 01:05:29,583
don't feel like going home.

1068
01:05:30,625 --> 01:05:33,292
I was going to take
home a daughter-in-law.

1069
01:05:35,333 --> 01:05:37,792
What will I go home
and do now?

1070
01:05:39,875 --> 01:05:43,042
Watch your mother's tears?

1071
01:05:45,417 --> 01:05:47,083
Everyone's eyes will be on us.

Look, there's Jugal Kishore Mishra.

Professor Jugal Kishore Mishra.

1074
01:05:59,333 --> 01:06:01,417
His son's marriage was planned.

1075
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,958
We have suffered
great humiliation, son.

What rubbish are you talking?

1080
01:06:37,958 --> 01:06:40,583
Look at me.
What are you talking?

1081

Pick up, pick up, please pick up!

1082

We won't spare them.

1083
01:06:50,417 --> 01:06:52,333
You are simply worrying.

And look,
as far as support is concerned,

1086
01:07:41,458 --> 01:07:45,500
we have started a single window
program for builders and developers.

1087

So you will no longer
have to run around.

I hope you will now come forward
and invest in our region.

[Knock on door]

1093
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:10,750
Neelam, how many times have I told you,
don't knock, just walk in.

1094
01:08:10,875 --> 01:08:14,208
And I have told you equal number
of times that over here, you are senior

1095
01:08:14,458 --> 01:08:15,375
and I'm your junior.

1096
01:08:15,917 --> 01:08:18,792
See, I attempted the competitive
exam five times,

1097
01:08:19,042 --> 01:08:20,417
but I couldn't clear it,

1098
01:08:20,542 --> 01:08:22,958
whereas you cleared it
at first attempt.

1099
01:08:23,417 --> 01:08:26,833
By the way, Aarti,
I cannot thank you enough.

1100
01:08:27,375 --> 01:08:30,542
I have this job because of you,
or I'd still be in Kanpur

1102

Shut up.
Will you have tea?

anywhere, anytime.

Aarti, the rumors I am hearing
in office, are they true?

1106
01:08:46,542 --> 01:08:48,542
That depends on what the rumor is.

1107
01:08:48,667 --> 01:08:52,250
Don't pretend now. The whole office
is talking only about one thing.

Sir, you know me since so many years.
You think I can do such a thing?

1152
01:10:54,083 --> 01:10:57,208
Aarti, the question is not what
I find right or wrong.

1153
01:10:57,583 --> 01:11:00,541
The point is that things are against
you in the departmental enquiry.

1154
01:11:00,542 --> 01:11:02,416
And now, an official enquiry
has begun into the matter

1155

tomorrow at 9am.

accepting bribes?

You want to accept bribes
and become rich?

But I guess it's okay.

1173
01:12:28,333 --> 01:12:30,917
You are a part of the system,
accepting a bribe is normal for you.

anything, Aarti Shukla.

Now I will do what I want.

1181

and six years in prison

You have been keeping
an eye on her since four years.

You even managed to convince the
minister to bring the case under you?

What do you think though?
Is she guilty?

1192
01:13:56,958 --> 01:13:58,542
That makes no difference to me.

1193
01:13:59,083 --> 01:14:03,125
I only know that I will punish her
for what I think she is guilty of.

01:14:12,583 --> 01:14:14,667
Everything is fair in love and war.

1197
01:14:15,333 --> 01:14:17,708
Love is over, now war begins.

1198
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:29,417
Be happy.

1199
01:14:30,375 --> 01:14:31,833
What happened?
- Have sweets.

1200
01:14:31,958 --> 01:14:33,250
Why are you so happy,
what is the good news?

1201
01:14:33,375 --> 01:14:34,958
See this news.

1202
01:14:35,625 --> 01:14:37,707
What news?
- Take a look.

1203
01:14:37,708 --> 01:14:40,375
Why are you showing us this
witch's photo? What happened?

1204
01:14:40,667 --> 01:14:43,167
Madam acted very proud.

1205
01:14:43,542 --> 01:14:45,999
She was against dowry
so she ran away from her marriage.

1206
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,167
Let her try to run away now.

1207
01:14:47,292 --> 01:14:48,375
Why, what happened?

1208
01:14:48,500 --> 01:14:50,167
She is going to be in jail
very soon.

1209
01:14:50,292 --> 01:14:52,542
Jail? Why?
- For accepting a bribe.

1210
01:14:52,667 --> 01:14:54,500
And the bribe is not small.
- Oh.

1211
01:14:54,625 --> 01:14:56,792
The bribe amount is 30 million.
- 30 million!

1212
01:14:56,958 --> 01:14:59,292
We'll watch her go to jail now!
[Snaps finger]

1213
01:14:59,958 --> 01:15:01,416
Have sweets, brother-in-law.

1214
01:15:01,417 --> 01:15:03,708
Let me see the news. - Yes,
we surely deserve to celebrate this.

1215
01:15:03,833 --> 01:15:05,958
Take.
- Yes, I'll take it.

1216
01:15:07,250 --> 01:15:08,333
In Lucknow?

1217
01:15:09,083 --> 01:15:10,875
Even Sattu is in Lucknow.

1218
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,457
I'll tell Sattu, he will be pleased.
- Sure, tell him.

1219
01:15:13,458 --> 01:15:15,583
[Cellphone rings]

1220
01:15:17,833 --> 01:15:19,917
Greetings, Mom.
- There's good news for you.

1221
01:15:20,042 --> 01:15:21,832
What happened?
I'm going to become an uncle?

1222
01:15:21,833 --> 01:15:23,292
No, this news is even better.

1223
01:15:23,750 --> 01:15:27,208
That Shukla's daughter
who left you at the altar,

1224
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:30,833
has been accused of accepting
a bribe of 30 million.

1225
01:15:32,208 --> 01:15:34,000
She is going to go to jail.

1226
01:15:34,167 --> 01:15:36,375
She is in Lucknow, find out about it.

1227
01:15:37,667 --> 01:15:39,208
I'll call you later.

1228
01:15:40,167 --> 01:15:42,167
Good day.
- All right. Good day.

1229
01:15:55,042 --> 01:15:57,749
So Poonam, how much money
did Sattu demand

1230
01:15:57,750 --> 01:15:59,791
that his bride just left the
ceremony and ran away?

1231
01:15:59,792 --> 01:16:03,708
I can marry you without
any dowry demands.

1232
01:16:03,833 --> 01:16:05,791
What do you say?
- [Laughs]

1233
01:16:05,792 --> 01:16:06,625
Hey, where are you going?

1234
01:16:10,167 --> 01:16:10,958
Take, Sattu.

1235
01:16:13,625 --> 01:16:15,167
Don't mind, buddy.

1236
01:16:17,208 --> 01:16:18,792
Listen, Mahesh,

1237
01:16:18,917 --> 01:16:21,542
She has not run away because of dowry.
- Oh?

1238
01:16:21,667 --> 01:16:24,916
She has run away so that
she can become an officer. - Oh!

1239
01:16:24,917 --> 01:16:29,332
And hundreds of clerks like Sattu
can work under her.

1240
01:16:29,333 --> 01:16:34,750
She doesn't care one bit
for clerks like Sattu. - Oh, really?

He created a ruckus in the house.
He damaged everything.

1266
01:18:53,625 --> 01:18:57,250
Just because he became an IAS,
he will do anything, raid anybody's house?

1267
01:18:58,625 --> 01:19:00,832
Bindu, get a glass.
- Yes, sis.

1268
01:19:00,833 --> 01:19:02,832
He has deliberately taken
the file under him

1269
01:19:02,833 --> 01:19:03,917
can't you see that, sis?

1270
01:19:04,042 --> 01:19:05,792
He has come only to
take revenge from her.

1271
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:09,250
But when Aarti is innocent,
why should we all be afraid?

1272
01:19:09,375 --> 01:19:13,667
Because we cannot stop him.
He has all the power.

1273

He has clearly told her
that he will have her sent to jail.

1274
01:19:17,250 --> 01:19:18,583
You are in deep trouble.

1275
01:19:18,708 --> 01:19:21,458
Behind professionalism,
he is taking personal revenge from you.

1276
01:19:23,917 --> 01:19:25,583
Sis, what do you suggest?
What should we do now?

1277
01:19:32,292 --> 01:19:33,125
Aarti.

don't cry.

Go and apologise to him.

1283
01:19:52,292 --> 01:19:55,542
Look, he loved you very much,
maybe that's why he is so angry.

1284
01:19:55,667 --> 01:19:57,542
Maybe he forgives you.

1285
01:19:57,750 --> 01:20:00,208
And I have heard he has not
even got married yet.

1286
01:20:01,375 --> 01:20:05,833
Meet him somewhere outside office,
invite him for coffee.

1287

Please have a seat,
I'll call sir. Sit.

- How can I help you?

Listen, I'm really sorry.

1290
01:21:04,333 --> 01:21:05,042
For what?

1291
01:21:05,917 --> 01:21:07,625
For doing what I did to you.

1292
01:21:09,292 --> 01:21:10,875
I regret it till today.

1293
01:21:11,458 --> 01:21:14,042
Dowry was just an excuse.

1294

I'd attempted the competitive exams...
- Will you have tea?

Yes, sir.
- Get two cups tea.

Okay, sir.

1299
01:21:29,542 --> 01:21:30,875
So, what were you saying?

1300
01:21:32,500 --> 01:21:34,833
I'd attempted the competitive exams.

1301
01:21:35,792 --> 01:21:37,208
Its result came on our marriage...

1302
01:21:38,750 --> 01:21:40,250
It came on our marriage day.

1303
01:21:42,625 --> 01:21:44,667
I didn't know what to do.

1304
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:47,917
I even sent you a message.

will never let me work.

Hmm, what?

1308
01:22:00,458 --> 01:22:02,875
I admit what I did to you
was very wrong.

1309
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:04,958
I caused you a lot of pain.

1310
01:22:05,750 --> 01:22:08,083
I am genuinely sorry.

1311
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,500
I understand why you
are so angry with me.

1312
01:22:14,917 --> 01:22:16,500
But what can I do now?

1313
01:22:17,833 --> 01:22:20,500
If you were so sorry,
why didn't you try to meet me?

1314
01:22:22,167 --> 01:22:23,792
I called you so many times.

1315
01:22:25,750 --> 01:22:28,083
You know,
I thought we loved each other.

1316
01:22:31,667 --> 01:22:33,625
But now that I am
handling your case,

1317
01:22:33,750 --> 01:22:35,375
you realise your mistake now?

1318
01:22:36,042 --> 01:22:36,750
Huh?

1319
01:22:37,958 --> 01:22:40,333
If I had not come here,
you wouldn't even think of me again.

1320
01:22:41,167 --> 01:22:41,833
Right?

1321
01:22:44,042 --> 01:22:45,125
You were practical then,

1322
01:22:45,792 --> 01:22:47,042
you are very practical even now.

1323
01:22:49,375 --> 01:22:50,875
Only, you have become hotter now.

1324
01:22:52,250 --> 01:22:55,042
Hmm, officer Aarti Shukla?

1325
01:22:56,250 --> 01:22:57,417
Very tempting.

1326
01:23:00,208 --> 01:23:01,417
Desirable.

1327
01:23:02,042 --> 01:23:03,000
Excuse me?

1328
01:23:03,250 --> 01:23:04,958
Are you feeling awkward?

1329
01:23:06,833 --> 01:23:09,875
You have come so decked up,
why me, even stone will melt.

1330
01:23:11,208 --> 01:23:12,083
Isn't it?

1331
01:23:13,042 --> 01:23:15,250
Let's first finish with the purpose
you have come here for.

1332
01:23:15,375 --> 01:23:17,250
Shall I shut the door quickly?

1333
01:23:17,458 --> 01:23:18,458
Satyendra.

1334
01:23:19,583 --> 01:23:21,625
Please don't talk like this.
- What?

1335
01:23:23,083 --> 01:23:26,000
Stop, stop talking to me in this way.

1336
01:23:26,917 --> 01:23:27,625
Okay.

1337
01:23:29,125 --> 01:23:30,125
Then how...

1338
01:23:31,458 --> 01:23:33,083
Then tell me how should I talk to you?

1339
01:23:38,042 --> 01:23:38,917
Look at yourself.

1340
01:23:41,500 --> 01:23:42,833
Have you come to seduce me?

1341
01:23:45,125 --> 01:23:46,417
Have you come to seduce me?

1342
01:23:47,042 --> 01:23:48,083
Come on, I'm ready.

1343
01:23:49,417 --> 01:23:51,167
Come, come, fast.
- Satyendra.

1344
01:23:52,750 --> 01:23:55,083
Listen, Miss Aarti Shukla.

1345
01:23:55,208 --> 01:23:56,875
If you think that seeing
your beautiful face

1346
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,167
I will forget my family
and my humiliation,

1347
01:23:59,792 --> 01:24:00,875
that will never happen.

1348
01:24:02,583 --> 01:24:04,333
And you don't ever forget that.

1349
01:24:06,458 --> 01:24:08,250
Please don't make
this personal, Satyendra.

1350
01:24:08,583 --> 01:24:09,792
It is personal.

1351
01:24:10,208 --> 01:24:11,708
It's very personal.

1352
01:24:12,917 --> 01:24:16,417
I can never forget
how you cheated me.

1353
01:24:17,833 --> 01:24:19,458
This is my life's biggest fight.

1354
01:24:20,125 --> 01:24:22,042
And yes, I'm not angry,

1355
01:24:23,458 --> 01:24:24,917
I hate you!

1356
01:24:27,292 --> 01:24:29,292
Now get out of here.

1357
01:24:30,250 --> 01:24:31,750
Satyendra...
- Get out!

1358
01:24:32,625 --> 01:24:33,917
I'm sorry...
- Get out!

1359
01:24:36,292 --> 01:24:37,333
Get out, move.

1360
01:24:43,083 --> 01:24:43,833
Miss Shukla.

1361
01:24:46,250 --> 01:24:48,375
Don't ever wear pink again
and come before me.

1362
01:24:49,583 --> 01:24:50,875
You disgust me.

1363
01:24:52,792 --> 01:24:53,500
Out.

1364
01:24:57,333 --> 01:25:00,000
[Crying]

1365
01:25:02,125 --> 01:25:03,917
Sir, tea.
- Keep it here.

1366
01:25:07,375 --> 01:25:08,208
Yes, tell me.

1367
01:25:09,292 --> 01:25:11,167
Sir, this is Aarti's father's
passbook,

1368
01:25:11,750 --> 01:25:13,083
and this is her personal passbook.

1369
01:25:13,833 --> 01:25:15,000
This is personal?
- Yes.

1370
01:25:16,250 --> 01:25:17,333
And that builder Kukreja?

1371
01:25:17,833 --> 01:25:19,208
He has many businesses.

1372
01:25:19,417 --> 01:25:21,125
He has contacts with ministers.

1373
01:25:21,583 --> 01:25:24,166
He bought this particular land
to put up a factory there.

1374
01:25:24,167 --> 01:25:26,667
He is in London now,
he will be back by next week.

1375
01:25:26,917 --> 01:25:27,667
Who got this deal done?

1376
01:25:27,792 --> 01:25:29,708
Yes sir, I got this deal finalised.

1377
01:25:30,125 --> 01:25:32,042
It's my job, sir.

1378
01:25:32,583 --> 01:25:34,000
Did he have the land papers?

1379
01:25:34,250 --> 01:25:37,500
How can one sell land
without the papers?

1380
01:25:38,458 --> 01:25:40,375
And where is the owner?
He moved to America? - Yes, sir.

1381
01:25:40,500 --> 01:25:42,375
And obviously
you don't have his number.

1382
01:25:43,333 --> 01:25:44,208
No, sir.

1383
01:25:44,667 --> 01:25:45,333
Any address?

1384
01:25:45,708 --> 01:25:47,125
I'm here, where else can I be?

1385
01:25:47,250 --> 01:25:49,375
I've come at 9 in the morning
and it is 5pm now.

1386
01:25:49,500 --> 01:25:50,708
Have you eaten anything since morning?

1387
01:25:50,917 --> 01:25:52,999
No. I can eat only
after I leave from here.

1388
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:54,583
I am not allowed to move from here.

1389
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:56,250
Okay, take care. Bye.

1390
01:26:08,667 --> 01:26:09,624
[Cellphone rings]

1391
01:26:09,625 --> 01:26:11,750
Okay listen, I'll call you back.
Okay.

1392
01:26:14,625 --> 01:26:15,458
Sir.

1393
01:26:17,875 --> 01:26:19,000
Yes sir, I spoke to him.

1394
01:26:20,250 --> 01:26:21,750
I have to meet him at 9:30 tomorrow.

1395
01:26:22,042 --> 01:26:22,957
Madam, come tomorrow at 9am.

1396
01:26:22,958 --> 01:26:24,917
I'll talk to him,
let me see what he has to say.

1397
01:26:29,042 --> 01:26:29,875
Where were these pictures taken?

1398
01:26:33,750 --> 01:26:36,875
Sir, I'd gone for a site visit.

1399
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,667
This is the same plot
that Mr. Kukreja has bought.

1400
01:26:39,875 --> 01:26:42,500
You physically went and verified where
the land is and how much it measures?

1401
01:26:43,125 --> 01:26:45,500
And then knowingly transferred
government land to Kukreja's name.

1402
01:26:45,667 --> 01:26:48,667
No sir, I really did not know.

1403
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:52,750
Who is this man?

1404
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:55,792
He is Mr. Kukreja's CEO.

1405
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,875
Mr. Segal, you must be
purchasing a lot of land.

1406
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,083
Yes.
- This plot of land you bought,

1407
01:27:00,542 --> 01:27:02,583
it's market value is about 150 million.

1408
01:27:04,250 --> 01:27:05,333
How much did you buy it for?

1409
01:27:06,167 --> 01:27:08,375
Sir, actually, at that time...
- 60 million.

1410
01:27:10,542 --> 01:27:11,333
Yes.

1411
01:27:11,750 --> 01:27:13,792
You got land worth 150 million
for 60 million.

1412
01:27:14,667 --> 01:27:15,958
You made a direct profit of 60 million.

1413
01:27:16,167 --> 01:27:19,167
60... - Yes, you paid
30 million to Aarti Shukla, right?

1414
01:27:23,250 --> 01:27:24,250
Are they your friends?

1415
01:27:25,042 --> 01:27:27,583
No sir,
I only know them professionally.

1416
01:27:27,792 --> 01:27:29,417
He has gifted you a car.

1417
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:31,833
Sir,

1418
01:27:33,250 --> 01:27:36,792
he bought it in my name
and gifted it to me on my birthday.

1419
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,167
I even sent it back
but he did not take it.

1420
01:27:39,375 --> 01:27:43,458
Even today, it is just parked
in my parking, I have never used it.

1421
01:27:43,958 --> 01:27:45,292
Umesh.
- Sir.

1422
01:27:45,708 --> 01:27:47,417
Has anyone ever gifted you a car?

1423
01:27:47,667 --> 01:27:49,583
No sir, never.
- No, never?

1424
01:27:49,875 --> 01:27:51,667
No, sir.
- See, even they are officers.

1425
01:27:52,792 --> 01:27:54,000
But you seem to be someone special.

1426
01:27:56,125 --> 01:27:59,042
This property deal was struck
three days after your birthday.

1427
01:27:59,792 --> 01:28:03,708
Being in the system,
you cannot refuse bribes, right?

1428
01:28:04,917 --> 01:28:06,000
Isn't that what you believe?

1429
01:28:09,042 --> 01:28:10,667
Mr. Kukreja, you are such
a big industrialist.

1430
01:28:11,083 --> 01:28:13,333
Yes, sir. - You did not
verify the property papers?

1431
01:28:13,500 --> 01:28:14,708
That sounds impossible.

1432
01:28:15,333 --> 01:28:19,208
That this is government land,
I think only your officers would know.

1433
01:28:19,833 --> 01:28:21,500
I am only concerned with papers.

1434
01:28:21,833 --> 01:28:24,417
The papers were in order
so I bought the land.

1435
01:28:24,792 --> 01:28:25,458
Are you sure?

1436
01:28:25,667 --> 01:28:27,167
I am sure, Satyendra.

1437
01:28:27,333 --> 01:28:29,417
Aarti can never accept a bribe
from anyone.

1438
01:28:29,917 --> 01:28:33,667
I think there is some confusion.
- Did I ask for your advice, Mrs. Neelam?

1439
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:37,792
No, sir.

1440
01:28:39,375 --> 01:28:42,041
Who is this?
- He is Aarti's friend.

1441
01:28:42,042 --> 01:28:42,958
Not yours?

1442
01:28:44,542 --> 01:28:47,542
Sir, how can such big people
be my friends?

1443
01:28:48,125 --> 01:28:50,417
Aarti used to take me
along with her to these parties,

1444
01:28:50,833 --> 01:28:52,083
so I went along.

1445
01:28:53,792 --> 01:28:56,250
What does your husband do?
- He's a school teacher.

1446
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:58,333
How much do you two earn together?

1447
01:28:58,500 --> 01:29:00,125
How much can I earn, sir?

1448
01:29:00,333 --> 01:29:03,042
I only got my commission.

1449
01:29:03,250 --> 01:29:08,042
Mr. Kukreja said he will
handle the government office.

1450
01:29:08,167 --> 01:29:09,708
How am I at fault, sir?

1451
01:29:12,125 --> 01:29:13,667
Look, you have a right, Aarti.

1452
01:29:13,833 --> 01:29:17,042
If you wish, you can request a
change of the investigating officer.

1453
01:29:17,375 --> 01:29:19,875
But if you take my advice,
don't do that.

1454
01:29:20,042 --> 01:29:22,917
Because as far as I know,
DM is a good guy.

1455
01:29:23,125 --> 01:29:27,708
The officer you get in his place,
his reputation regarding women is not good.

1456
01:29:28,125 --> 01:29:30,125
So, I leave it to you.

1457
01:29:33,042 --> 01:29:36,208
Once we meet the CM, then we'll
decide what is to be done. - Excuse me.

1458
01:29:36,375 --> 01:29:38,042
Tell sir I'll have lunch and come.

1459
01:29:43,083 --> 01:29:45,500
Good afternoon, ma'am.
Pramod Singh.

1460
01:29:46,292 --> 01:29:48,375
I've done law
from Allahabad university.

1461
01:29:48,750 --> 01:29:51,417
Ma'am, I know you from my college days,
I was your senior.

1462
01:29:52,208 --> 01:29:53,500
How can I help you?

1463
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:57,125
Ma'am, you tell me
how I can help you.

1464
01:29:57,583 --> 01:30:02,042
You see, whoever is
your investigating officer,

1465
01:30:02,375 --> 01:30:06,125
I will strike a deal with him for you.
He will pronounce you innocent.

1466
01:30:06,417 --> 01:30:09,958
But for that ma'am,
you will have to...

1467
01:30:13,208 --> 01:30:15,083
I am her investigation officer.

1468
01:30:18,542 --> 01:30:20,291
Strike a deal.
- Sir, I don't know him.

1469
01:30:20,292 --> 01:30:21,042
Come on.

1470
01:30:21,625 --> 01:30:23,916
You know her?
- Yes sir, I know her.

1471
01:30:23,917 --> 01:30:25,458
She is your friend?
- Yes.

1472
01:30:25,583 --> 01:30:28,417
Her going to jail is certain,
at least for six years.

1473
01:30:28,833 --> 01:30:31,625
You.. what is your name?
- Pramod, sir.

1474
01:30:31,750 --> 01:30:34,250
Pramod. I'll send you also
to jail along with her.

1475
01:30:34,542 --> 01:30:36,000
Huh? She'll have company.

1476
01:30:38,042 --> 01:30:38,792
Pick the pad.

1477
01:30:44,917 --> 01:30:46,042
Write a letter for me.

1478
01:30:48,292 --> 01:30:49,125
Greetings, Mom.

1479
01:30:52,500 --> 01:30:53,333
Greetings, Dad.

1480
01:30:54,583 --> 01:30:56,458
Aarti Shukla's enquiry...

1481
01:30:58,542 --> 01:30:59,625
Come on, write.

1482
01:31:01,750 --> 01:31:03,333
Aarti Shukla's enquiry

1483
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:05,208
is going well.

1484
01:31:05,750 --> 01:31:07,667
All evidence is against her.

1485
01:31:10,167 --> 01:31:12,167
There is no hope of her acquittal.

1486
01:31:16,708 --> 01:31:18,625
There is no hope.

1487
01:31:19,333 --> 01:31:23,792
Tell Mom to prepare to
make an offering to God.

1488
01:31:24,667 --> 01:31:26,167
Prepare to make an offering...

1489
01:31:27,750 --> 01:31:28,750
to God.

1490
01:31:30,833 --> 01:31:33,875
Aarti Shukla will certainly go to jail.

1491
01:31:35,667 --> 01:31:36,833
What did you write?

1492
01:31:39,042 --> 01:31:39,792
What?

1493
01:31:42,750 --> 01:31:43,542
It is certain.

1494
01:31:44,125 --> 01:31:45,167
Full stop!

1495
01:31:47,833 --> 01:31:49,333
Your obedient son...

1496
01:31:50,667 --> 01:31:51,958
I'll write the name.

1497
01:31:54,667 --> 01:31:55,708
You may leave.

1498
01:31:58,000 --> 01:31:59,250
Sit outside.

1499
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:04,292
Love is not easy.
Just know

1500
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:06,333
it's a sea of fire...

1501
01:32:06,458 --> 01:32:07,583
You have to drown in it to cross it.

1502
01:32:07,708 --> 01:32:10,125
No, you have to destroy yourself in it.

1503
01:32:10,292 --> 01:32:12,833
You changed it.
- Understood?

1504
01:32:12,958 --> 01:32:13,583
Of course.

1505
01:32:16,375 --> 01:32:17,958
Hear this one, Priyansh.

1506
01:32:19,042 --> 01:32:21,458
Never make this promise to anyone

1507
01:32:22,042 --> 01:32:24,167
That you will love her
more than yourself

1508
01:32:24,542 --> 01:32:26,500
That's a good one.

1509
01:32:26,792 --> 01:32:27,833
Right.

1510
01:32:28,167 --> 01:32:31,000
Talk of love is utter nonsense.
- Really?

1511
01:32:32,458 --> 01:32:35,000
I want to talk to you.
- Look who has come to see me.

1512
01:32:38,167 --> 01:32:42,500
This couplet I just recited,
I dedicate it to my friend here,

1513
01:32:43,708 --> 01:32:44,833
Miss...

1514
01:32:46,375 --> 01:32:47,625
What's her name?

1515
01:32:47,750 --> 01:32:51,083
Aarti Shukla.
- Aarti! I dedicate it to Miss Aarti Shukla.

1516
01:32:52,375 --> 01:32:53,917
She is very famous.

1517
01:32:54,042 --> 01:32:55,375
She's a very practical girl.

1518
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:57,375
She's quite controversial.

1519
01:32:57,833 --> 01:32:59,583
There was news on her
in the papers recently.

1520
01:33:00,417 --> 01:33:04,000
The 30 million bribe case, she's the one.
- Oh.

1521
01:33:04,417 --> 01:33:05,833
Now if one has to go to jail,

1522
01:33:06,167 --> 01:33:09,624
why just 30 million, one should
at least take 100-200 million.

1523
01:33:09,625 --> 01:33:11,041
[Laughs]

1524
01:33:11,042 --> 01:33:13,000
30 million is nothing nowadays.

1525
01:33:21,667 --> 01:33:22,625
This is the men's room.

1526
01:33:24,708 --> 01:33:26,917
I cannot bear this torture
anymore, Satyendra.

1527
01:33:27,250 --> 01:33:30,583
I feel suffocated. I cannot breathe.
What do you want from me?

1528
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:32,042
What can I want from you?

1529
01:33:32,625 --> 01:33:33,916
I'm only doing my job. Move!

1530
01:33:33,917 --> 01:33:36,417
Doing your job or taking
advantage of the opportunity?

1531
01:33:36,958 --> 01:33:38,875
I am taking advantage of the opportunity?
- Yes.

1532
01:33:39,042 --> 01:33:40,292
I've learnt that from you.

1533
01:33:40,875 --> 01:33:42,208
You'd taken advantage then,
I'm taking it now.

1534
01:33:42,500 --> 01:33:45,083
I had not taken any advantage
of the opportunity, Satyendra.

1535
01:33:45,667 --> 01:33:48,333
Do you know what taking advantage
of the opportunity is? - What?

1536
01:33:48,833 --> 01:33:51,708
If I shout now and
say you are molesting me.

1537
01:33:51,917 --> 01:33:56,167
Satyendra Mishra, IAS, my investigating
officer is asking for favors from me.

1538
01:33:56,292 --> 01:33:58,042
That's called being an opportunist.

1539
01:33:58,333 --> 01:34:01,500
Go and say it.
- No, I won't.

1540
01:34:01,667 --> 01:34:03,333
Because I am not like that.

1541
01:34:03,792 --> 01:34:06,000
I wasn't like that then,
nor am I like that now.

1542
01:34:06,750 --> 01:34:09,375
The result came, you were at the door,
I didn't know what to do.

1543
01:34:09,500 --> 01:34:12,625
Your mother had told my sister
she will never let me work.

1544
01:34:12,750 --> 01:34:13,958
What could I have done?

1545
01:34:14,792 --> 01:34:16,125
You should have spoken to me.

1546
01:34:17,542 --> 01:34:19,250
You should have trusted me.
- How?

1547
01:34:19,375 --> 01:34:20,917
I loved you!

1548
01:34:22,750 --> 01:34:24,916
You did not think of me
even once in these five years.

1549
01:34:24,917 --> 01:34:26,499
[Crying]

1550
01:34:26,500 --> 01:34:29,208
You are shedding tears
before me now, huh?

1551
01:34:30,125 --> 01:34:31,958
What about what I went through?

1552
01:34:32,333 --> 01:34:34,167
Satyendra... - What about the
pain my parents went through?

1553
01:34:34,292 --> 01:34:37,583
I agree, but what can I do now?
What can I do?

1554
01:34:38,208 --> 01:34:39,958
What can you not bear?

1555
01:34:40,875 --> 01:34:42,333
That I left you?

1556
01:34:42,750 --> 01:34:45,500
Huh? You couldn't bear the rejection?

1557
01:34:46,458 --> 01:34:50,833
Did you once ever think
that if I had not left you

1558
01:34:51,042 --> 01:34:53,625
you would never have been at
the post you are on today?

1559
01:34:54,167 --> 01:34:56,375
What do you mean?
- If I had not left you,

1560
01:34:56,750 --> 01:35:00,167
you wouldn't be charged and wouldn't
work towards becoming an officer.

1561
01:35:00,958 --> 01:35:04,042
You would be a clerk even today.
Have you ever given that a thought?

1562
01:35:08,917 --> 01:35:10,500
[Chuckles]

1563
01:35:13,875 --> 01:35:17,042
Aarti Shukla, the truth is out.

1564
01:35:18,833 --> 01:35:23,042
Being an officer, you had a problem
marrying a clerk. - Satyen...

1565
01:35:23,333 --> 01:35:25,917
You found that humiliating.
- Satyendra...

1566
01:35:26,875 --> 01:35:29,167
I was a lowly clerk,
I lacked status.

1567
01:35:29,292 --> 01:35:31,500
You never understood me then,
you don't understand me now.

1568
01:35:31,625 --> 01:35:33,749
What's wrong with you? - You wanted
to travel in a car with a beacon.

1569
01:35:33,750 --> 01:35:35,750
I was never worthy of you.
- I was only...

1570
01:35:36,750 --> 01:35:37,875
Aarti Shukla,

1571
01:35:39,083 --> 01:35:41,167
you were selfish then,
you are selfish now.

1572
01:35:42,417 --> 01:35:45,417
You... I don't want to talk!
- Satyendra, that's not what I meant.

1573
01:35:45,542 --> 01:35:46,875
Satyendra, talk to...

1574
01:35:47,958 --> 01:35:49,500
I'm talking to you.

1575
01:35:50,708 --> 01:35:52,542
I am not selfish.

1576
01:35:54,500 --> 01:35:56,333
You want to send me to jail?

1577
01:35:56,625 --> 01:36:00,417
Send me to jail. Call the cops
right now and get me arrested.

1578
01:36:00,542 --> 01:36:02,125
Why tomorrow, I'll go to jail today.

1579
01:36:03,958 --> 01:36:06,750
At least I will not have to endure
this daily torture, Satyendra.

1580
01:36:07,333 --> 01:36:10,750
I can't take this anymore.
I'll admit I accepted a bribe.

1581
01:36:11,625 --> 01:36:13,124
I will... [Crying]

1582
01:36:13,125 --> 01:36:14,083
Go.

1583
01:36:17,792 --> 01:36:19,250
I can't take it anymore.

1584
01:36:20,583 --> 01:36:22,500
Call them right now!
- Okay, okay.

1585
01:36:22,625 --> 01:36:25,667
Calm down. Calm down.
- No! What calm down?

1586
01:36:27,042 --> 01:36:29,042
You want to talk,
we will talk.

1587
01:36:29,500 --> 01:36:31,458
You don't know to talk, Satyendra.

1588
01:36:31,667 --> 01:36:33,042
We will sit calmly and talk.

1589
01:36:34,292 --> 01:36:37,167
I really cannot take it
anymore, Satyendra.

1590
01:36:38,208 --> 01:36:40,042
I'm sorry, I think
I got a little too angry today.

1591
01:36:46,167 --> 01:36:48,042
I felt you are going
to kill me today.

1592
01:37:01,833 --> 01:37:03,625
How did you develop the habit
of smoking?

1593
01:37:04,333 --> 01:37:06,167
I kind of went mad after you left.

1594
01:37:07,333 --> 01:37:08,667
I was totally confused.

1595
01:37:09,750 --> 01:37:11,333
Let it be,
it's all water under the bridge now.

1596
01:37:16,458 --> 01:37:17,500
Choose one finger.

1597
01:37:21,542 --> 01:37:22,417
Choose.

1598
01:37:28,375 --> 01:37:30,875
If you don't mind,
shall we kiss?

1599
01:37:33,750 --> 01:37:34,625
What...

1600
01:37:35,083 --> 01:37:36,375
Just one kiss?

1601
01:37:37,917 --> 01:37:39,792
I will not doubt your character.

1602
01:37:41,583 --> 01:37:43,208
No. Satyendra!

1603
01:37:43,333 --> 01:37:46,167
No, not I,
you will kiss me.

1604
01:37:47,417 --> 01:37:50,000
A deep, passionate kiss.

1605
01:37:55,458 --> 01:37:56,417
And over there

1606
01:37:57,500 --> 01:37:58,542
is a five-star hotel.

1607
01:37:59,458 --> 01:38:00,625
We'll go there after.

1608
01:38:01,250 --> 01:38:02,792
We will spend the night there.

1609
01:38:04,208 --> 01:38:07,292
In a five-star hotel, you won't
mind doing anything. - Satyendra!

1610
01:38:07,833 --> 01:38:10,000
You only had said it, you forgot?

1611
01:38:10,458 --> 01:38:13,167
You know it was just a joke.
- I'm not joking.

1612
01:38:14,042 --> 01:38:16,208
It is the price for you
not being in jail tonight.

1613
01:38:19,792 --> 01:38:20,750
Come on.

1614
01:38:23,708 --> 01:38:24,875
Satyendra!

1615
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,083
I misunderstood you.

1616
01:38:33,083 --> 01:38:34,958
Won't you ask this time
what was the choice on my other finger?

1617
01:38:37,792 --> 01:38:38,917
It's the 10th today.

1618
01:38:39,625 --> 01:38:41,208
The committee result will come
within a week.

1619
01:38:42,208 --> 01:38:44,667
Send the 30 million you have to us.

1620
01:38:45,042 --> 01:38:46,000
Bribe.

1621
01:38:47,125 --> 01:38:50,417
I am a part of the system.
If I refuse, force it on me.

1622
01:38:50,542 --> 01:38:53,875
I have not accepted any bribe,
I don't have 30 million.

1623
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,917
Ask from Kukreja,
he won't refuse you.

1624
01:38:58,417 --> 01:39:00,917
You are holding many truths
about him close to your chest.

1625
01:39:12,250 --> 01:39:16,083
Mr. Shukla, we will not be
able to help you in this matter.

1626
01:39:16,250 --> 01:39:17,917
No ma'am, please don't say that.

1627
01:39:18,042 --> 01:39:20,708
Satyendra is not a kid.

1628
01:39:21,333 --> 01:39:23,708
Whatever he is doing,
he is aware of it.

1629
01:39:25,042 --> 01:39:29,083
If he's asking for 30 million,
pay him 30 million.

1630
01:39:29,292 --> 01:39:32,375
Where will I bring 30 million from?
- Look, Mr. Shukla,

1631
01:39:32,750 --> 01:39:35,833
we could neither say anything then,
nor can we say anything now.

1632
01:39:36,708 --> 01:39:39,625
I'd sold my jewelry once,

1633
01:39:40,042 --> 01:39:43,000
to save my husband
and my brother's life.

1634
01:39:43,625 --> 01:39:47,833
Now you see what you can sell
to save your daughter's life.

1635
01:39:48,042 --> 01:39:51,457
Even if I sell myself
I won't be able to gather 30 million.

1636
01:39:51,458 --> 01:39:53,583
That is your problem, Mr. Shukla.

1637
01:39:57,542 --> 01:40:00,167
Come ma'am,
Mr. Kukreja is waiting for you.

1638
01:40:02,500 --> 01:40:04,750
Yes, it will be done, I'll do it.
- Come, ma'am.

1639
01:40:05,750 --> 01:40:07,625
Welcome, madam.

1640
01:40:08,750 --> 01:40:12,500
I have been thinking since some days
that I have never met you,

1641
01:40:12,958 --> 01:40:14,958
although I have heard
a lot about you.

1642
01:40:15,708 --> 01:40:20,083
Mr. Kukreja, if I am proved guilty in
this enquiry, I could lose my job.

1643
01:40:20,333 --> 01:40:22,667
My parents will lose their house,
I could go to jail.

1644
01:40:22,792 --> 01:40:24,625
You must come forward
and tell the truth.

1645
01:40:24,750 --> 01:40:26,750
The world knows the truth, madam.

1646
01:40:27,167 --> 01:40:29,917
Don't unnecessarily act innocent
in my presence.

1647
01:40:30,042 --> 01:40:31,625
You have taken 30 million.

1648
01:40:31,833 --> 01:40:33,833
I have taken 30 million?

1649
01:40:34,042 --> 01:40:36,042
Didn't you share the money
with your department?

1650
01:40:36,583 --> 01:40:38,667
That means you took all the money?

1651
01:40:38,958 --> 01:40:41,291
You should have distributed some
among your colleagues.

1652
01:40:41,292 --> 01:40:44,291
What are you talking about?
I have not taken any money from you.

1653
01:40:44,292 --> 01:40:46,333
Someone from your department
has squealed.

1654
01:40:46,750 --> 01:40:49,333
I have lost my reputation and money
all because of you.

1655
01:40:49,458 --> 01:40:53,208
And now that you are in a spot,
you want me also to join you.

1656
01:40:53,667 --> 01:40:57,250
Oh, great! I have come across
many officers, but you...

1657
01:41:07,500 --> 01:41:09,792
Miss Aarti Shukla is trying
to manipulate the investigation.

1658
01:41:10,375 --> 01:41:11,750
Arrest her right away.

1659
01:41:12,542 --> 01:41:13,750
Yes, right away.

1660
01:41:20,917 --> 01:41:23,958
This is the worst that can happen.

1661
01:41:25,542 --> 01:41:27,417
He is taking his revenge.

1662
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,250
Let us try one more time.
- Take.

1663
01:41:32,333 --> 01:41:34,125
I have kept everything in this.

1664
01:41:34,417 --> 01:41:37,958
Okay.
- Just get her released quickly.

1665
01:41:38,167 --> 01:41:43,583
Don't cry. Pray to God
that they release Aarti.

1666
01:41:45,083 --> 01:41:46,083
Come, Jogi.

1667
01:41:58,833 --> 01:41:59,792
Look at me.

1668
01:42:00,708 --> 01:42:03,375
I am where you wanted me to be.

1669
01:42:07,208 --> 01:42:09,125
Your revenge is taken now I hope.

1670
01:42:11,125 --> 01:42:11,958
Happy birthday.

1671
01:42:14,958 --> 01:42:18,167
This night is the best birthday
gift of my life.

1672
01:42:19,417 --> 01:42:20,292
Thank you.

1673
01:42:26,667 --> 01:42:27,458
Sir.

1674
01:42:32,875 --> 01:42:35,417
I wish I had never met you.

1675
01:42:44,417 --> 01:42:45,500
These are my house papers.

1676
01:42:48,583 --> 01:42:50,208
Please free our Aarti.

1677
01:42:54,375 --> 01:42:56,333
I'd like to present all the
necessary proof and evidence

1678
01:42:56,458 --> 01:42:59,333
that we need to reach a conclusion
on Miss Aarti Shukla's case.

1679
01:43:00,667 --> 01:43:02,625
I'd like to seek the permission
of the honorable jury to proceed.

1680
01:43:02,750 --> 01:43:04,292
Please proceed.
- Thank you, sir.

1681
01:43:06,833 --> 01:43:08,833
I want you all
to watch this video carefully.

1682
01:43:12,083 --> 01:43:14,125
Is it written on my head
that I am a fool?

1683
01:43:14,542 --> 01:43:16,375
You are an educated woman.

1684
01:43:16,500 --> 01:43:18,583
You so conveniently
kept the 30 million to yourself.

1685
01:43:19,042 --> 01:43:20,333
Now you have come
to seek more money?

1686
01:43:21,125 --> 01:43:23,542
All right, I'll pay you.
I'll pay you whatever sum you demand.

1687
01:43:23,792 --> 01:43:27,292
Just get this case that started
because of your foolishness closed.

1688
01:43:31,125 --> 01:43:32,333
You want to say something?

1689
01:43:37,167 --> 01:43:37,875
No, sir.

1690
01:43:38,875 --> 01:43:40,500
I don't want to say anything.

1691
01:43:41,792 --> 01:43:43,917
I accept whatever punishment
you announce.

1692
01:43:48,500 --> 01:43:49,375
Forward it.

1693
01:43:49,958 --> 01:43:53,292
Mr. Kukreja, I am not going
to get intimidated by your words.

1694
01:43:53,625 --> 01:43:55,833
If I go to jail,
I won't spare you either.

1695
01:43:59,583 --> 01:44:02,125
Hey, you said she has
come to settle the matter.

1696
01:44:02,458 --> 01:44:04,042
I think she's mad.

1697
01:44:04,167 --> 01:44:06,708
She threatened that she
will have me imprisoned.

1698
01:44:06,833 --> 01:44:08,208
We'll have to do
something about her.

1699
01:44:08,333 --> 01:44:09,333
Kill the stupid woman.

1700
01:44:10,917 --> 01:44:13,542
Her ex-boyfriend has
come to take revenge.

1701
01:44:14,417 --> 01:44:16,292
He's gone after her like
a hungry wolf.

1702
01:44:16,417 --> 01:44:18,875
And we will become victims
of his foolishness.

1703
01:44:20,167 --> 01:44:22,250
We will have to put an end
to the drama of their love story.

1704
01:44:23,292 --> 01:44:24,292
Kill her

1705
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:25,792
today!

1706
01:44:39,583 --> 01:44:41,208
Can you explain, Mr. Mishra?

1707
01:44:43,583 --> 01:44:45,167
Yes sir, I can explain.

1708
01:44:46,417 --> 01:44:48,417
Mrs. Neelam Gupta's husband
is a school teacher.

1709
01:44:49,333 --> 01:44:52,333
And the broker, Mr. Rajesh Yadav,
who brokered this deal,

1710
01:44:52,458 --> 01:44:53,833
is her husband's childhood friend.

1711
01:44:55,375 --> 01:44:57,667
Mrs. Neelam retrieves information about
government land lying vacant since years

1712
01:44:57,792 --> 01:45:00,417
from government files
and gives it to her husband.

1713
01:45:01,500 --> 01:45:04,583
He forwards this message
to his broker friend Rajesh Yadav.

1714
01:45:04,708 --> 01:45:08,292
Then Rajesh forges the property papers
and sells them to different businessmen.

1715
01:45:09,750 --> 01:45:10,917
Right, Mr. Yadav?

1716
01:45:15,958 --> 01:45:17,458
Taking advantage of Aarti Shukla's
trust in her,

1717
01:45:17,583 --> 01:45:19,667
Mrs. Neelam takes her
signature on these documents.

1718
01:45:22,917 --> 01:45:24,917
They have been taking bribes in the
name of Aarti Shukla since many years.

1719
01:45:25,750 --> 01:45:27,042
And they share it amongst themselves.

1720
01:45:27,875 --> 01:45:30,083
Mr. Kukreja did give 30 million.

1721
01:45:31,417 --> 01:45:33,792
But Aarti Shukla was
totally unaware of it

1722
01:45:35,125 --> 01:45:37,042
because that money never reached her.

1723
01:45:43,542 --> 01:45:44,833
Right, Mrs. Neelam?

1724
01:45:46,917 --> 01:45:47,833
Thank you.

1725
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:56,250
The accused, please stand up.

1726
01:45:58,750 --> 01:45:59,875
Thank you, Mr. Mishra.

1727
01:46:00,292 --> 01:46:01,750
The evidence is conclusive.

1728
01:46:02,083 --> 01:46:06,250
The jury is of the opinion
that Miss Aarti Shukla is not guilty.

1729
01:46:10,833 --> 01:46:13,292
Take them into custody.
- Yes, sir.

1733
01:46:57,667 --> 01:46:58,458
Sir.

1734
01:47:10,458 --> 01:47:11,875
I realise today, sir,

1735
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:16,125
that it really breaks the heart when
you find out someone dear cheated you.

1736
01:47:18,583 --> 01:47:19,542
Thank you.

1737
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:22,542
Thank you so much, sir.

1738
01:47:24,792 --> 01:47:26,417
You can call me Satyendra.

1739
01:47:28,292 --> 01:47:29,792
You can join back office
coming Monday.

1740
01:47:30,292 --> 01:47:31,625
Thanks, Sattu.

1741
01:47:35,292 --> 01:47:36,625
Mr. Saxena, how are you?

1742
01:47:36,750 --> 01:47:39,875
Sir, sending Aarti into custody,
you saved her life.

1743
01:47:40,542 --> 01:47:42,125
That's very nice of you.
- Thank you.

1744
01:47:42,625 --> 01:47:44,542
Mr. Pramod, good job.
- Thank you, sir.

1745
01:47:45,208 --> 01:47:47,750
I'm leaving for Kanpur.
I'll come back and see you. - Sure.

1746
01:47:48,167 --> 01:47:48,917
Sir...

1747
01:47:58,875 --> 01:48:00,042
Aarti is innocent.

1749
01:48:12,625 --> 01:48:15,042
Listen, is Aarti all right?

1750
01:48:16,792 --> 01:48:19,208
Satyendra sent back
the house papers.

1751
01:48:20,792 --> 01:48:21,625
Yes.

1752
01:48:22,708 --> 01:48:23,708

once again"

1777
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,833
After so much happening,
anyone will feel revolted, Aarti.

1778
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:35,750
If I was in Sattu's place, even I would
lose faith in love and marriage.

1779
01:50:35,875 --> 01:50:37,208
You are right, sis.

1780
01:50:37,625 --> 01:50:41,458
But I know that Sattu
loves me very much even today.

1781
01:50:41,708 --> 01:50:43,291
If he didn't love me,

1782
01:50:43,292 --> 01:50:46,375
he wouldn't hate me so much to
become officer and take revenge from me.

1783
01:50:47,333 --> 01:50:50,042
Sattu never wanted
to become officer.

1784
01:50:51,792 --> 01:50:55,333
The problem is that his head has
told his heart not to love again.

1785
01:50:56,583 --> 01:51:00,917
Now I will silence his head
and make him listen to his heart.

became an IAS officer.

We will have to stop somewhere.

1793

If I have run, it is
away from you, Aarti Shukla.

Leave me alone,
our paths are different.

1795

I cannot drink Whiskey with you.

There was a time when
I desperately wanted to marry you.

1875

Shall I finish?

1879
01:56:49,708 --> 01:56:50,750
And see today.

1880
01:56:53,750 --> 01:56:56,125
You know, since the day I saw
my family shattered

1881
01:56:57,042 --> 01:56:59,375
I've begun to hate the
word 'marriage'.

1882
01:57:02,833 --> 01:57:04,667
And not just you,
I don't want to marry anyone

1883
01:57:05,083 --> 01:57:06,375
ever in my life.

1884
01:57:08,333 --> 01:57:09,667
Please get this clear.

1885
01:57:10,458 --> 01:57:11,375
Thank you.

1886
01:57:11,917 --> 01:57:12,707
Sattu...

1887
01:57:12,708 --> 01:57:16,958
"The color of love is white, pure!"

1888
01:57:17,208 --> 01:57:22,875
"There is no scope for cheating
and deceit in it"

1889
01:57:23,042 --> 01:57:28,958
"You are all colors merged in one"

1890
01:57:29,083 --> 01:57:38,792
"But you destroyed everything, beloved"

1891
01:57:39,250 --> 01:57:41,458
[Music]

1892
01:57:43,833 --> 01:57:49,666
"The war you are the chief of"

1893
01:57:49,667 --> 01:57:59,250
"I am a mere soldier of that war"

1894
01:57:59,417 --> 01:58:04,833
"How can you be so good?"

1895
01:58:05,042 --> 01:58:13,125
I want to lose myself
in your love"

1896
01:58:16,750 --> 01:58:21,208
"I want to spend my life only with you"

1897
01:58:22,792 --> 01:58:28,417
"I want to endure
life's sorrows with you"

1898
01:58:28,708 --> 01:58:31,625
"What I cannot tell the world"

1899
01:58:31,750 --> 01:58:36,417
"I want to tell only you"

1900
01:58:37,042 --> 01:58:40,417
"What I cannot tell the world"

1901
01:58:40,542 --> 01:58:45,292
"I want to tell only you"

1902
01:58:49,042 --> 01:58:49,958
Ranjan.

1903
01:58:50,875 --> 01:58:51,583
Yes, sis.

1904
01:58:51,792 --> 01:58:54,500
Are you nuts or what?
- What did I do?

1905
01:58:54,792 --> 01:58:58,417
What spelling is this? You don't
know your brother-in-law's name?

1906
01:58:59,792 --> 01:59:02,667
You wanted to become
an officer? Fool!

1907
01:59:03,292 --> 01:59:05,416
He's spelled Sharad as Sharda.

1908
01:59:05,417 --> 01:59:07,250
[Laughs]

1909
01:59:07,625 --> 01:59:09,083
Go get it printed right.

1910
01:59:09,208 --> 01:59:11,707
Time flies.

1911
01:59:11,708 --> 01:59:12,417
True.

1912
01:59:12,667 --> 01:59:15,333
But look at God's justice.

1913
01:59:15,792 --> 01:59:18,583
She is the one who cheated him
and he wants to remain unmarried.

1914
01:59:19,792 --> 01:59:23,833
Have you vowed never to
make us grandparents?

1915
01:59:24,458 --> 01:59:26,250
That evil woman is getting married.

1916
01:59:27,625 --> 01:59:30,291
Do you want to play with her children?
- Why will he do that?

1917
01:59:30,292 --> 01:59:32,542
Come on! Although you are right.
- [Laughs]

1918
01:59:33,208 --> 01:59:35,625
She is a girl, how long can
her father keep her single.

1919
01:59:35,750 --> 01:59:37,292
He had to get her married some day.

1920
01:59:37,417 --> 01:59:39,792
I am not stopping her,
I am telling him.

1921
01:59:40,667 --> 01:59:43,792
Son, give me the joy of becoming
a grandma before I die.

1922
01:59:44,917 --> 01:59:45,750
Yes son,

1923
01:59:46,750 --> 01:59:47,917
your mother is right.

1924
01:59:48,917 --> 01:59:51,958
Even we want grandchildren.

1925
01:59:53,250 --> 01:59:55,125
Don't you all have anything
else to speak about?

1926
01:59:55,917 --> 01:59:58,958
This is an important topic
for us, son. Your marriage...

1927
01:59:59,083 --> 02:00:02,375
Where are you going now?
- It's Tuesday, I'm going to the temple.

1928
02:00:20,708 --> 02:00:22,917
How are you?
- I'm fine.

1929
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:25,958
How are you?
- I'm fine.

1930
02:00:34,417 --> 02:00:35,458
I heard you are getting married.

1931
02:00:35,708 --> 02:00:36,625
[Chuckles]

1932
02:00:37,458 --> 02:00:39,500
I thought my enquiry is over.

1933
02:00:40,292 --> 02:00:41,125
Should I not?

1934
02:00:41,375 --> 02:00:43,250
No, of course not.
Do get married.

1935
02:00:44,375 --> 02:00:45,292
It's your life.

1936
02:00:47,708 --> 02:00:48,458
This...

1937
02:00:52,250 --> 02:00:53,333
Your stole.

1938
02:00:58,250 --> 02:01:02,042
I was wondering. A few days
back you told me you loved me.

1939
02:01:02,333 --> 02:01:03,833
That you wanted to marry me.

1940
02:01:03,958 --> 02:01:06,917
I was, but you refused to marry me.

1941
02:01:08,833 --> 02:01:10,458
You are a practical woman.

1942
02:01:11,833 --> 02:01:13,375
You always do the right thing
at the right time.

1943
02:01:13,667 --> 02:01:16,167
Did you want me to wait
for you all my life?

1944
02:01:16,917 --> 02:01:18,417
No, of course not.

1945
02:01:20,042 --> 02:01:21,042
But I'm happy

1946
02:01:21,833 --> 02:01:23,292
that I have decided
never to get married.

1947
02:01:24,708 --> 02:01:27,750
Or I would get someone like you.
- You'd never get anyone like me.

1948
02:01:27,875 --> 02:01:31,000
I'm unique.
And now, even I'm getting married.

1949
02:01:31,958 --> 02:01:34,000
Is everyone all right in the family?
- Yes.

1950
02:01:35,500 --> 02:01:36,333
Sharad.

1951
02:01:38,125 --> 02:01:40,125
He's Sharad, my fiancé.

1952
02:01:41,208 --> 02:01:45,207
Hello.
- He is Satyendra, my very old friend.

1953
02:01:45,208 --> 02:01:48,083
Friend?
- I know who he is.

1954
02:01:48,792 --> 02:01:51,417
Actually, she has told me
everything about you.

1955
02:01:51,750 --> 02:01:54,625
And I want to thank you.

1956
02:01:56,083 --> 02:01:59,292
I didn't do anything.
- Yes, thank you for not doing anything.

1957
02:01:59,708 --> 02:02:03,333
I mean, if you had married Aarti,
what would I do?

1958
02:02:03,875 --> 02:02:04,667
Right, Aarti?

1959
02:02:05,542 --> 02:02:08,250
I'll just be back in a minute.
- Okay.

1960
02:02:12,042 --> 02:02:12,917
Sharad.

1961
02:02:14,875 --> 02:02:15,833
You get the car.

1962
02:02:18,375 --> 02:02:20,458
If you don't mind,
shall I tell you something? - Yes.

1963
02:02:22,292 --> 02:02:23,625
Don't marry Aarti.

1964
02:02:24,417 --> 02:02:25,792
She cannot be trusted.

1965
02:02:26,792 --> 02:02:27,750
What do you mean?

1966
02:02:28,625 --> 02:02:30,542
Actually, don't mind,
but she's not stable.

1967
02:02:31,917 --> 02:02:35,500
Until a few days ago, she was madly
trying to convince me to marry her.

1968
02:02:36,375 --> 02:02:37,208
And see now.

1969
02:02:39,333 --> 02:02:40,708
Look, as a friend, I'm telling you,

1970
02:02:42,375 --> 02:02:44,125
if you marry her
you will be ruined.

1971
02:02:45,083 --> 02:02:46,917
I leave it to you.
It's your life, your problem.

1972
02:02:47,875 --> 02:02:49,000
Man to man.

1973
02:02:50,583 --> 02:02:52,500
Thank you for this surprise too.

1974
02:02:53,833 --> 02:02:55,042
Have oblation.

1975
02:02:56,875 --> 02:02:58,292
Satyendra...
- No, thank you.

1976
02:03:10,458 --> 02:03:12,167
How dare you, Satyendra Mishra!

1977
02:03:12,458 --> 02:03:13,458
I am unstable?

1978
02:03:13,875 --> 02:03:16,333
Marrying me,
Sharad's life will be ruined?

1979
02:03:16,917 --> 02:03:18,750
What do you want from me,
Satyendra?

1980
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:20,708
You don't want to marry me.

1981
02:03:20,833 --> 02:03:22,708
You won't let anybody else
marry me.

1982
02:03:22,833 --> 02:03:24,083
What should I do?

1983
02:03:25,542 --> 02:03:28,042
Do you love me?
- Of course, I love you.

1984
02:03:28,292 --> 02:03:30,500
How many times do I say
that I love you?

1985
02:03:31,042 --> 02:03:32,792
So you love me
and will marry someone else?

1986
02:03:34,208 --> 02:03:37,958
All right, I won't marry him.
Will you marry me? Huh?

1987
02:03:38,417 --> 02:03:39,542
Will you marry me?

1988
02:03:40,208 --> 02:03:43,542
You won't, because your
ego is coming in your way.

1989
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,708
I have decided to get married.

1990
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:49,292
One need not be in love
to get married, Sattu.

1991
02:03:50,292 --> 02:03:52,083
One can fall in love after marriage.

1992
02:03:53,333 --> 02:03:55,958
I'm getting married on the 10th, be there.
- I will not come.

1993
02:03:56,500 --> 02:03:57,708
Please do come.

1994
02:03:58,292 --> 02:03:59,625
I will like it.

1995
02:04:31,917 --> 02:04:33,375
Do come for the marriage.

1996
02:04:45,500 --> 02:04:46,458
Sattu.

1997
02:04:46,667 --> 02:04:48,917
Shanti, hurry up,
we have to leave.

1998
02:04:49,125 --> 02:04:50,333
We also have to pick up
Mahesh on the way.

1999
02:04:50,458 --> 02:04:51,417
You try once.

2000
02:04:51,542 --> 02:04:53,583
Call up the driver,
check where he has reached.

2001
02:04:53,708 --> 02:04:54,792
We are getting late.

2002
02:04:55,875 --> 02:04:57,667
What's going on?
Where are you going?

2003
02:04:57,792 --> 02:04:59,875
We are going for a marriage, son.
- Aarti's marriage?

2004
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:01,042
Yes.

2005
02:05:02,083 --> 02:05:02,792
Why are you all going?

2006
02:05:02,917 --> 02:05:06,625
Son, Mr. Shukla and his wife
themselves came to invite us.

2007
02:05:07,042 --> 02:05:10,583
They pleaded with us,
begged us to come.

2008
02:05:11,167 --> 02:05:12,458
We must go.

2009
02:05:12,708 --> 02:05:14,333
So what? Don't go.

2010
02:05:14,625 --> 02:05:18,083
Hey, you are looking very beautiful.
- Thank you.

2011
02:05:19,792 --> 02:05:22,375
I suggest you also come along.

2012
02:05:22,625 --> 02:05:24,833
No, I will never go.

2013
02:05:25,333 --> 02:05:27,042
I wonder why even you all are going.

2014
02:05:42,667 --> 02:05:45,208
Hello.
- Hello aunty, hello uncle.

2015
02:05:45,333 --> 02:05:46,542
Hello! Hello!

2016
02:05:46,917 --> 02:05:48,208
Good you came, Sattu.

2017
02:05:48,417 --> 02:05:50,083
Aarti just asked about you.

2018
02:05:50,833 --> 02:05:53,458
Good you came.
- Come on, the groom is here.

2019
02:05:53,583 --> 02:05:55,875
Oh. Excuse me.
- Come, sis.

2020
02:06:11,542 --> 02:06:15,000
Come Sattu, where were you?
- Hello, son-in-law.

2021
02:06:15,292 --> 02:06:18,875
Oh, sorry!
Son-in-law is over there.

2022
02:06:21,625 --> 02:06:23,875
Congratulations Jogi,
you found a good boy for Aarti.

2023
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:27,125
I just met him. - Not just the boy,
even the family is very good.

2024
02:06:27,500 --> 02:06:29,167
They have not made any demand.
- Oh.

2025
02:06:29,500 --> 02:06:30,208
Uncle.

2026
02:06:30,417 --> 02:06:33,249
Sattu, come, I'll introduce you
to brother-in-law. - Yes, take him.

2027
02:06:33,250 --> 02:06:34,874
No, it's okay.
- Come on.

2028
02:06:34,875 --> 02:06:35,833
Go.

2029
02:06:36,375 --> 02:06:37,833
Thank you so much.
- Come, Sattu.

2030
02:06:37,958 --> 02:06:40,292
Greetings, aunt.
- Greetings, son. Bless you.

2031
02:06:44,500 --> 02:06:45,042
Brother-in-law.

2032
02:06:45,250 --> 02:06:48,083
Come, let me introduce you.
He's Aarti's future husband.

2033
02:06:48,708 --> 02:06:49,833
I've met him.

2034
02:06:50,125 --> 02:06:52,458
Sorry, friend. You gave the
advice but I did not follow it.

2035
02:06:52,667 --> 02:06:54,792
No, I'm sorry,
I shouldn't have said that.

2036
02:06:55,750 --> 02:06:58,792
Truly speaking,
I sensed jealousy in your words.

2037
02:06:59,083 --> 02:07:01,375
Like if Aarti cannot belong to you, she
should not belong to anybody else, right?

2038
02:07:01,875 --> 02:07:03,749
Listen, I'm too embarrassed, really.

2039
02:07:03,750 --> 02:07:06,250
No, don't be.
Actually, I'm grateful.

2040
02:07:06,583 --> 02:07:08,292
It's good you let Aarti go.

2041
02:07:08,667 --> 02:07:10,333
Or she wouldn't be going
with me today.

2042
02:07:10,792 --> 02:07:13,292
Dad has booked your honeymoon
to Mussoorie.

2043
02:07:14,083 --> 02:07:15,750
Shall we go now?
It's time for the marriage ceremony.

2044
02:07:15,875 --> 02:07:17,458
Yes, let's go. Excuse me.
- Come.

2045
02:07:19,042 --> 02:07:21,583
Come.
- Honeymoon in Mussoorie!

2046
02:07:29,708 --> 02:07:31,958
Where are you?
- Look to your left.

2047
02:07:40,542 --> 02:07:42,792
Shall I tell you something?
You look lovely in pink.

2048
02:07:43,250 --> 02:07:45,667
Why do you think I'm wearing pink?

2049
02:07:45,792 --> 02:07:47,167
Oh, you mean, for me?

2050
02:07:48,792 --> 02:07:51,250
I've fallen in love with you.

2051
02:07:52,917 --> 02:07:54,458
You liked me so much?

2052
02:07:55,042 --> 02:07:56,708
Send me your picture
dressed as a bride.

2053
02:08:12,167 --> 02:08:13,292
How do I look?

2054
02:08:13,875 --> 02:08:15,542
Just like my bride.

2055
02:08:17,958 --> 02:08:19,917
What have I done, Aarti?

2056
02:08:20,458 --> 02:08:21,750
I'm really sorry.

2057
02:08:22,167 --> 02:08:23,875
I love you very much.

2058
02:08:25,125 --> 02:08:27,042
I will not be able to live without you.

2059
02:08:29,042 --> 02:08:31,750
I ruined everything
because of my ego.

2060
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:35,125
I love you.

2061
02:08:41,583 --> 02:08:42,833
Shall I tell you something?

2062
02:08:45,167 --> 02:08:47,375
Earlier, you ran away from the
marriage for your own sake.

2063
02:08:49,125 --> 02:08:51,500
This time, run away for your love.

2064
02:08:52,792 --> 02:08:54,042
How can I run away?

2065
02:08:54,792 --> 02:08:58,375
Mom, Dad, Sharad, his family.

2066
02:08:58,667 --> 02:09:00,125
I'll talk to all of them.

2067
02:09:01,125 --> 02:09:03,625
I'll convince everyone,
but don't get married.

2068
02:09:04,125 --> 02:09:05,500
Just come with me.

2069
02:09:08,292 --> 02:09:09,167
Come.

2070
02:09:11,042 --> 02:09:12,667
What happened? What...

2071
02:09:15,917 --> 02:09:16,833
Choose a finger.

2072
02:09:24,542 --> 02:09:26,708
I cannot go with you, Satyendra.

2073
02:09:28,125 --> 02:09:31,042
I cannot once again break the
hearts of somebody's family.

2074
02:09:31,458 --> 02:09:34,917
No, Aarti,
I'm really sorry, please!

2075
02:09:35,042 --> 02:09:37,917
If I was wrong then,
I will be wrong today too.

2076
02:09:38,042 --> 02:09:41,333
You were not wrong, Aarti.
Please, I'm really sorry.

2077
02:09:42,375 --> 02:09:44,625
You cannot belong to anybody else,
Aarti, I love you.

2078
02:09:44,750 --> 02:09:45,792
What should I do?
- Aarti.

2079
02:09:48,833 --> 02:09:49,750
How did he come inside?

2080
02:09:50,500 --> 02:09:52,041
Satyendra, please.
- Wait, we are talking.

2081
02:09:52,042 --> 02:09:53,292
What are you doing?

2082
02:09:53,417 --> 02:09:55,417
Leave us alone for a few minutes.
- What are you doing?

2083
02:09:55,542 --> 02:09:57,458
Move back, we are talking!
- Satyendra!

2084
02:09:57,667 --> 02:09:59,250
Why did you push me?
- Give me two minutes.

2085
02:09:59,375 --> 02:10:01,417
Sharad, please.
- How dare you push me!

2086
02:10:01,542 --> 02:10:03,000
Why did you push me, you idiot!
- Sharad!

2087
02:10:03,167 --> 02:10:05,750
Stop him!
Put a gun to his temple.

2088
02:10:05,875 --> 02:10:07,624
Sharad.
- He's acting like a hero.

2089
02:10:07,625 --> 02:10:09,708
Come, Aarti.
- You stay here.

2090
02:10:20,958 --> 02:10:21,667
Move aside!

2091
02:10:22,375 --> 02:10:23,375
Sit down here!

2092
02:10:24,250 --> 02:10:26,333
Priest, begin!
Sit down!

2093
02:10:36,958 --> 02:10:39,583
Father-in-law, she has made it her
habit to run away on the day of marriage.

2094
02:10:39,708 --> 02:10:42,458
I have dragged her here.
Priest, begin the ceremony.

2095
02:10:42,833 --> 02:10:44,583
Stand up!
- Sattu, no! Sattu!

2096
02:10:45,042 --> 02:10:46,625
I will kill you!
- Sattu, don't.

2097
02:10:46,875 --> 02:10:48,999
I'm telling you I love Aarti.
Can't you understand?

2098
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:50,375
Have you gone mad?

2099
02:10:50,500 --> 02:10:54,042
Sattu, no! - Uncle, keep quiet!
I won't listen to anybody today!

2100
02:10:54,167 --> 02:10:55,917
Sattu, listen to me.
- You come here.

2101
02:10:56,042 --> 02:10:58,208
If Aarti cannot belong to me, she won't
belong to anybody. I will shoot him!

2102
02:10:58,333 --> 02:11:00,042
What are you doing?
Let us talk.

2103
02:11:00,167 --> 02:11:01,292
I will kill you!

2104
02:11:01,417 --> 02:11:03,208
I'm warning the last time.
I'll kill you!

2105
02:11:03,333 --> 02:11:06,500
Brother-in-law,
why are you overacting?

2106
02:11:06,625 --> 02:11:08,000
What is he doing?

2107
02:11:08,542 --> 02:11:10,458
He's aimed a gun at me.
This was not in the plan.

2108
02:11:10,583 --> 02:11:12,875
Brother-in-law Sharad,
I'm not telling you.

2109
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:14,625
I'm telling brother-in-law Sattu.

2110
02:11:14,833 --> 02:11:17,208
What? - What?
- What's going on?

2111
02:11:18,167 --> 02:11:19,500
Now what is all this about?

2112
02:11:21,208 --> 02:11:25,542
What do you all think?
Only you all can plan, do the drama?

2113
02:11:28,542 --> 02:11:29,458
I've become DM!

2114
02:11:30,125 --> 02:11:30,875
Tell them.

2115
02:11:32,750 --> 02:11:35,042
Aarti is gone.
You stay here.

2116
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:42,042
It's a gun, it can go.
- You will show me the gun?

2117
02:11:42,333 --> 02:11:43,417
You will show me the gun?
- Sir, don't hit me.

2118
02:11:44,083 --> 02:11:46,999
You will show me the gun?

2119
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:49,624
You fish out your gun in every
marriage? - Sir, it hurts.

2120
02:11:49,625 --> 02:11:51,124
Don't beat me, please.

2121
02:11:51,125 --> 02:11:53,041
You'll show me the gun? - It hurts,
brother-in-law, don't beat me.

2122
02:11:53,042 --> 02:11:54,250
Calling me brother-in-law?
Are you making fun of me?

2123
02:11:54,375 --> 02:11:57,625
I'll tell you.
- What will you tell me?

2124
02:11:57,792 --> 02:11:59,208
Listen.
- What?

2125
02:12:00,125 --> 02:12:02,542
You are getting married.

2126
02:12:03,667 --> 02:12:06,042
You could have told me
that you are hand in glove with Sattu.

2127
02:12:06,167 --> 02:12:08,416
What could I do?
He beat me so much.

2128
02:12:08,417 --> 02:12:11,042
[Laughs]
- My cheeks turned red.

2129
02:12:12,792 --> 02:12:13,708
I'm really sorry.

2130
02:12:14,083 --> 02:12:16,625
Let me introduce you.
He's Aarti's brother-in-law.

2131
02:12:16,958 --> 02:12:17,917
Yours too.

2132
02:12:18,750 --> 02:12:19,832
Sorry, brother-in-law.

2133
02:12:19,833 --> 02:12:20,916
[Laughs]

2134
02:12:20,917 --> 02:12:21,958
No, but seriously,

2135
02:12:23,042 --> 02:12:24,875
you all did so much
for Aarti and me.

2136
02:12:25,833 --> 02:12:26,792
Thank you so much.

2137
02:12:27,042 --> 02:12:27,792
Thank you, Dad.

2138
02:12:27,958 --> 02:12:29,916
Move away the gun!

2139
02:12:29,917 --> 02:12:30,916
[Laughs]

2140
02:12:30,917 --> 02:12:33,208
But I must say,
you all acted really well.

2141
02:12:34,750 --> 02:12:35,875
Give me the groom's turban.

2142
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:38,083
Sure.
- Brother-in-law, the turban.

2143
02:12:40,333 --> 02:12:42,417
Where did the priest go?
Call the priest.

2144
02:12:47,375 --> 02:12:49,000
Where is the priest?
Call the priest.

2145
02:12:50,292 --> 02:12:51,625
Bless you.

2146
02:13:15,458 --> 02:13:19,791
"Buy me a gold ring and a gold bangle."

2147
02:13:19,792 --> 02:13:24,042
"Give me the gifts and take me home."

2148
02:13:28,625 --> 02:13:32,750
"Buy me a gold ring and a gold bangle."

2149
02:13:32,958 --> 02:13:37,124
"Give me the gifts and take me home."

2150
02:13:37,125 --> 02:13:41,499
"Don't underestimate me, I'm beautiful."

2151
02:13:41,500 --> 02:13:45,625
"I can make you go crazy."

2152
02:13:45,917 --> 02:13:53,707
"The end of my scarf dangles."

2153
02:13:53,708 --> 02:13:58,625
"Just.. just get a little naughty,
my love."

2154
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:07,625
"The end of your scarf dangles."

2155
02:14:24,875 --> 02:14:27,291
"You've international looks
but Indian attire."

2156
02:14:27,292 --> 02:14:29,457
"It's an awesome combination."

2157
02:14:29,458 --> 02:14:33,791
"I'm popular in Bollywood,
mind your tantrums"

2158
02:14:33,792 --> 02:14:38,166
"Men go crazy for you as you're unique."

2159
02:14:38,167 --> 02:14:42,207
"There are beautiful heroines
but nobody like you."

2160
02:14:42,208 --> 02:14:44,416
"As your scarf slips"

2161
02:14:44,417 --> 02:14:46,624
"My heartbeats increase."

2162
02:14:46,625 --> 02:14:48,749
"Come close and show your face."

2163
02:14:48,750 --> 02:14:51,375
"I feel high without drinking."

2164
02:14:53,417 --> 02:14:57,832
"Your intentions don't seem good,
my love."

2165
02:14:57,833 --> 02:15:02,125
"You make me feel shy."

2166
02:15:06,333 --> 02:15:10,916
"Your intentions don't seem good,
my love."

2167
02:15:10,917 --> 02:15:14,999
"You make me feel shy."

2168
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:19,000
"You've naughty plans."

2169
02:15:19,208 --> 02:15:24,042
"You can't be trusted."

2170
02:15:24,208 --> 02:15:28,499
"As you get naughty,
how do I control myself?"

2171
02:15:28,500 --> 02:15:32,582
"You keep staring at me."

2172
02:15:32,583 --> 02:15:40,624
"The end of my scarf dangles."

2173
02:15:40,625 --> 02:15:45,791
"Just.. just get a little naughty,
my love."

2174
02:15:45,792 --> 02:15:49,958
"The end of your scarf dangles."

2175
02:15:50,247 --> 02:15:54,542
"The end of your scarf dangles."

2176
02:15:55,292 --> 02:15:58,083
Uncle, book tickets for Mussorie.
- Okay, I'll get it

2177
02:16:00,539 --> 02:16:02,375
Bless you.

2178
02:16:03,375 --> 02:16:04,582
We've a crazy family.

2179
02:16:04,583 --> 02:16:06,333
All's well that ends well.
