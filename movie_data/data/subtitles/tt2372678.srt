1
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:13,371
Doctor...

2
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:17,605
The internet has confused
me with too many options

3
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:19,209
That's why I'm here.

4
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:21,046
I need some help.

5
00:02:22,108 --> 00:02:23,314
I...

6
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:27,184
I want to kill myself.

7
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:29,617
Suicide.

8
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,155
I haven't showered in a week...

9
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:37,568
nor have I
spoken to anyone.

10
00:02:38,024 --> 00:02:41,198
Even my ceiling fan
stopped responding.

11
00:02:42,428 --> 00:02:45,238
Maybe I'm going insane.

12
00:02:45,431 --> 00:02:47,502
Slightly, but...

13
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:58,546
The homes and hearts of you...

14
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:00,725
South Indians
are the same...

15
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,616
completely hollow.

16
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:15,006
How can I forget...

17
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:20,301
I've replayed that day
in my mind a thousand times.

18
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:21,503
And what is this
supposed to be?

19
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:22,512
Sam bar.

20
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:24,310
- This?!
- Yes.

21
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:26,179
Is there a problem?

22
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:29,181
Just one problem.
You!

23
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:31,153
If you have a problem,
keep moving.

24
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,248
Excuse me!
You're cutting the line.

25
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:35,259
How will he eat if
he doesn't cut the line?!

26
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:36,794
I've been the 'Head Cook'
here for 10 years!

27
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,031
Not a single 'complan'
against my sambar!

28
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,632
There hasn't been a single 'complan',
that's why no improvement!

29
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:44,430
Can anyone eat this?!

30
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,226
No...

31
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:51,098
But you'll get used
to it in a while.

32
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:53,641
The rasgulla's not bad.
Try it.

33
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:56,438
Give me the rasgulla.

34
00:03:56,502 --> 00:03:57,640
Finish your food first.

35
00:03:57,704 --> 00:03:59,775
Who do you think you are?

36
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:01,174
Give it to me!

37
00:04:04,143 --> 00:04:05,281
One more.

38
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:07,115
One rasgulla per student.

39
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:08,751
Very good.

40
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:11,052
What's edible,
one per student...

41
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:12,619
miserable sambar unlimited!

42
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:14,164
Give her mine...

43
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:16,591
Please.

44
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:19,035
Please.

45
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,012
Where did this stupid
idiot come from?

46
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:34,618
Teaching ME about sambar.

47
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,051
Hi
