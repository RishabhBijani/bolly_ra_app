1
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,959
Once upon a time
there were a Prince and a Princess...

2
00:01:34,209 --> 00:01:37,750
Stories my grandma told me
as a young girl often started like that.

3
00:01:38,334 --> 00:01:41,000
Everyone loves such fairy tales.

4
00:01:41,417 --> 00:01:47,125
We crave stories of love,
romance and all its madness.

5
00:01:47,209 --> 00:01:48,792
Like in the films.

6
00:01:49,292 --> 00:01:52,917
The handsome prince,
the beautiful princess...

7
00:01:53,125 --> 00:01:54,875
dance to a romantic ballad.

8
00:01:55,459 --> 00:01:59,042
The first lock of eyes.
Then, lovelorn looks.

9
00:01:59,417 --> 00:02:03,250
And love songs bursting
with false promises.

10
00:02:03,917 --> 00:02:05,750
And finally... a happy ending.

11
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:08,667
But, that's far from the truth.

12
00:02:09,042 --> 00:02:11,084
Grandma's story was true.

13
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,417
Once upon a time
there were a Prince and a Princess...

14
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,959
They both died. The End.

15
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,084
Gayatri and I
had an arranged marriage.

16
00:02:24,334 --> 00:02:25,792
It wasn't a love match.

17
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:32,042
Last year we celebrated
our 50th wedding anniversary.

18
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:35,584
And in these 50 years,
we fell deeply in love.

19
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:37,584
We had a deal.

20
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:42,459
She'd bring me bed tea
every morning.

21
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:45,542
And every night,
I would turn off the lights

22
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:47,917
and tuck into bed with her.

23
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,250
But...

24
00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:53,500
she left before me.

25
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:57,000
Accept our prayers.

26
00:02:58,834 --> 00:03:00,667
On behalf of Thy servant.

27
00:03:01,834 --> 00:03:03,250
- Hello.
- Hello, Kizie.

28
00:03:03,334 --> 00:03:04,810
- Are you feeling unwell?
- I can't talk right now.

29
00:03:04,834 --> 00:03:06,125
- No!
- Why are you whispering?

30
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:08,500
- Are you breathless?
- I'm fine, Ma.

31
00:03:08,584 --> 00:03:11,709
What are you saying, Kizie?
Is the cylinder empty?

32
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:15,209
Mom, please take a chill pill.
I'm in a movie.

33
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:16,709
- Amen.
- Hello, hello.

34
00:03:16,792 --> 00:03:17,584
Kizie?

35
00:03:17,667 --> 00:03:18,667
Bye, Ma.

36
00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:33,292
They're all strangers for me.

37
00:03:33,584 --> 00:03:35,125
As I, to them.

38
00:03:35,292 --> 00:03:38,000
But, I don't know why...
when I hug them,

39
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:40,917
I feel that I'm able
to take away some of their loneliness.

40
00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:44,667
Or is it mine?

41
00:03:55,917 --> 00:03:59,459
This angry young woman is my mother.

42
00:04:12,042 --> 00:04:14,917
Durgesh, what time
did Kizie come here?

43
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,417
An hour back.

44
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,667
Don't lie!

45
00:04:18,084 --> 00:04:20,625
- I came 15 minutes ago from the cinema.
- Really?

46
00:04:20,792 --> 00:04:23,042
- After watching a film.
- Which one?

47
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:25,250
- The new one...
- New one?

48
00:04:25,417 --> 00:04:27,959
It stars David Dhawan's son.

49
00:04:28,042 --> 00:04:29,125
The one about dance.

50
00:04:30,167 --> 00:04:31,875
Let's Dance Tonight, right?

51
00:04:32,042 --> 00:04:33,917
That's right!

52
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:36,417
There's no film with that name.

53
00:04:36,584 --> 00:04:37,667
Concentrate on your job.

54
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,101
No need to eavesdrop
on our conversation.

55
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:40,584
He's talking nonsense.

56
00:04:41,334 --> 00:04:42,709
Is he?

57
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,500
Ma, me and the rickshaw driver, Durgesh.

58
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:50,292
The same little lanes.

59
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:51,917
The same trivial talk.

60
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:54,917
My small world in Jamshedpur.

61
00:04:55,834 --> 00:04:57,417
My name's Kizie Basu.

62
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:59,042
Don't ask why.

63
00:04:59,209 --> 00:05:00,834
Welcome to my boring world.

64
00:05:01,042 --> 00:05:05,542
Day and night...
medicines all the time!

65
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:13,084
Dad.

66
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,292
Kizie, come here. Sit with me.

67
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:21,292
I start my day watching
National Geographic with dad.

68
00:05:23,667 --> 00:05:27,834
I think he likes animals
more than humans.

69
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,209
Kizie, eat this.

70
00:05:32,417 --> 00:05:33,542
Ma, what are you doing?

71
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:36,792
Open your mouth.
Why are you resisting them?

72
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:39,125
This is your favourite cheesecake.

73
00:05:39,209 --> 00:05:40,834
I hate cheesecake.

74
00:05:41,209 --> 00:05:43,000
How can you hate cheesecake, Kizie?

75
00:05:43,459 --> 00:05:44,750
Aren't you a true Bengali?

76
00:05:44,792 --> 00:05:47,917
Mom thinks just like E.T. and Elliot
had a critical bond,

77
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,792
so do Bengali's and their cheesecake.

78
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:54,042
I'm sure diabetes will kill me
before my cancer does.

79
00:05:54,584 --> 00:05:55,417
Yes.

80
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,084
I have cancer. Thyroid cancer.

81
00:05:58,209 --> 00:06:00,792
And this cylinder
is my best friend, Pushpinder.

82
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,917
The oxygen in it is my boon.

83
00:06:03,292 --> 00:06:05,292
And its weight is my bane.

84
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:08,417
But, Dr Jha gives me
the deepest blues.

85
00:06:11,542 --> 00:06:14,125
You're a brave girl.

86
00:06:14,167 --> 00:06:17,709
And so long as you stay strong,
there's hope.

87
00:06:18,084 --> 00:06:19,084
Nonsense!

88
00:06:19,459 --> 00:06:20,875
I don't want to be strong.

89
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:22,584
I just want to be normal.

90
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:27,334
I want to laugh like a normal girl.
Cry for normal reasons.

91
00:06:27,584 --> 00:06:31,500
I want to gossip about the girl
wearing the gaudy pink skirt.

92
00:06:31,584 --> 00:06:36,417
And I want to crush on
the most handsome boy in college.

93
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:40,584
But even in my dreams
instead of a guitar,

94
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:43,125
my hero stands
with an oxygen cylinder.

95
00:06:43,917 --> 00:06:46,000
I think I'm losing it.

96
00:07:09,584 --> 00:07:12,000
I only have one wish.

97
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,542
I want to meet Abhimanyu Veer.

98
00:07:14,917 --> 00:07:16,959
He's my favourite musician.

99
00:07:17,917 --> 00:07:20,125
But, surely every wish
doesn't get fulfilled.

100
00:07:20,792 --> 00:07:23,917
Anyway, enough for today.

101
00:07:24,792 --> 00:07:26,000
Shall we meet tomorrow?

102
00:07:26,167 --> 00:07:28,209
Another boring day
in the life of Kizie Basu.

103
00:08:10,292 --> 00:08:11,292
Hey, Manny.

104
00:08:12,542 --> 00:08:13,542
Manny!

105
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:18,000
Will this audience know
superstar Rajnikanth's song?

106
00:08:18,042 --> 00:08:20,542
JP, this is just to show our love for him.

107
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:28,875
- The real show will be in Hindi.
- How?

108
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:31,334
Shall I show you? The heart...

109
00:08:42,084 --> 00:08:44,292
JP, saw my killer charm?

110
00:08:44,459 --> 00:08:48,875
With a chiselled face like yours,
one look is enough.

111
00:08:49,084 --> 00:08:52,292
My baby boy looks just don't cut it.

112
00:08:53,209 --> 00:08:54,334
Let's go, now.

113
00:09:08,167 --> 00:09:09,584
What a lovely performance.

114
00:09:09,667 --> 00:09:11,667
A big round of applause
for Brij Bhushan.

115
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:12,834
Louder!

116
00:09:13,042 --> 00:09:15,250
Hey, don't waste plastic.

117
00:09:16,084 --> 00:09:18,292
Show some respect for the talent.

118
00:09:19,334 --> 00:09:20,875
And the next performer is...

119
00:09:21,209 --> 00:09:23,500
Kishan Bajaj with his magic tricks!

120
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:27,292
Kishan... yay!

121
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:29,375
Now, now. Come back another time.

122
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:33,875
Hey Manny, you're back?

123
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:36,209
Did the Delhi folks boo you away?

124
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:41,667
All your batch mates are now MBAs.
And you're still lurking here?

125
00:09:43,042 --> 00:09:44,209
Quiet!

126
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:48,584
Manny, get off the stage. Now!

127
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,250
Or else I'll call your father.

128
00:09:50,334 --> 00:09:52,959
7-6-6...
He would love it, ma'am.

129
00:09:55,709 --> 00:09:57,709
Lights! Music!

130
00:13:03,459 --> 00:13:05,625
Immanuel Rajkumar Junior.

131
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:10,250
Kizie Basu.

132
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:12,167
Of course, I'll kiss you, Basu.

133
00:13:12,334 --> 00:13:13,334
Ha-ha-ha!

134
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:15,250
I've never heard the joke before.

135
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,959
It wasn't a joke.

136
00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:20,250
Who named you, Kissie?

137
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:21,959
- It's not Kissie.
- Then?

138
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:23,417
- It's Kizie.
- Oh.

139
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,334
- Z.
- Yeah.

140
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:25,709
- It's a Zambian name.
- Oh...

141
00:13:26,292 --> 00:13:28,417
And which planet is that?

142
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:31,167
- Zambia's in Africa.
- Oh, okay.

143
00:13:31,209 --> 00:13:32,250
I was born there.

144
00:13:33,709 --> 00:13:35,709
Then it's not your fault.

145
00:13:36,709 --> 00:13:37,875
I was only...

146
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:41,292
What does Kizie mean?
I'm just curious.

147
00:13:43,959 --> 00:13:46,250
One that always stays with you.

148
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,792
You mean... a clingy latch.

149
00:13:47,959 --> 00:13:48,959
Shut up.

150
00:13:50,167 --> 00:13:51,459
You must be a latch.

151
00:13:52,084 --> 00:13:53,959
Me? Of course... Obviously.

152
00:13:56,209 --> 00:13:58,084
Ah!

153
00:14:00,417 --> 00:14:02,459
My bike's working now.
Come, I'll drop you.

154
00:14:02,792 --> 00:14:03,584
Thanks.

155
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:04,459
Why?

156
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,792
- I'll manage.
- Why?

157
00:14:05,959 --> 00:14:07,292
You don't look safe.

158
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:10,459
You look like a serial killer.

159
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,917
I'm a serial killer
and you a serial kisser.

160
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:16,125
What a pair! No?

161
00:14:16,292 --> 00:14:17,292
Kizie.

162
00:14:20,917 --> 00:14:22,042
Hi, Mrs Basu.

163
00:14:22,834 --> 00:14:24,459
I'm Kizie's new boy.

164
00:14:26,042 --> 00:14:26,959
Friend.

165
00:14:27,042 --> 00:14:28,042
Boy friend.

166
00:14:38,792 --> 00:14:42,417
Sometimes I feel
like a reality show contestant.

167
00:14:42,792 --> 00:14:46,334
I'm about to be eliminated
but someone votes for me

168
00:14:46,834 --> 00:14:48,750
and I manage to stay on
for another week.

169
00:14:49,084 --> 00:14:53,959
And when the wild card entry appears,
there's mayhem.

170
00:14:54,334 --> 00:14:58,042
Immanuel Rajkumar Junior
reminds me of that wild card entry.

171
00:14:58,667 --> 00:15:00,584
Irritating. Arrogant.

172
00:15:00,792 --> 00:15:02,834
Narcissistic to the core.

173
00:15:03,667 --> 00:15:05,584
But, I don't want him
to get eliminated.

174
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,334
I'm tempted to watch him perform
for another week.

175
00:15:12,917 --> 00:15:14,125
So...

176
00:15:14,584 --> 00:15:15,542
Hey, Manny.

177
00:15:15,584 --> 00:15:18,042
Good to see so many of you here
at this session.

178
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:20,792
Who wants to start? Anyone?

179
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:23,292
Hi, everyone. I'm Omkar.

180
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:25,459
21, Hodgkin's Lymphoma.

181
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:29,125
I'm sleeping well this week.

182
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:31,792
Dr Jha has said that
my reports are better.

183
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,459
But, I miss my friends.

184
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:37,000
Those lectures, picnics...

185
00:15:41,584 --> 00:15:43,375
Will you act in my film?

186
00:15:44,459 --> 00:15:45,334
What?

187
00:15:45,417 --> 00:15:48,792
JP and I are making a film.
Would you like to act in it?

188
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,584
You're mad.

189
00:15:51,084 --> 00:15:52,292
Dr Jha's here.

190
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:54,542
Keep the faith.

191
00:15:54,834 --> 00:15:56,792
He doesn't fit the bill.
It's a female role.

192
00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:00,584
Look, Immanuel Rajkumar Junior...

193
00:16:02,084 --> 00:16:04,125
You've learned my full name
so quickly.

194
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:05,375
Naughty girl!

195
00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:07,542
Anyone else? JP?

196
00:16:08,042 --> 00:16:09,709
Ah yes, sir.

197
00:16:10,667 --> 00:16:12,542
What do you shoot all day?

198
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:14,667
- Sir, we're making a film.
- Really?

199
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:19,875
And we'll make such a great film
that everyone will appreciate it.

200
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:22,250
Hello.

201
00:16:22,292 --> 00:16:24,834
My name is JP. Jagdish Pandey.

202
00:16:26,209 --> 00:16:27,917
I have cancer of the eyes.

203
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:31,584
Optic nerve glaucoma,
isn't it doctor?

204
00:16:32,167 --> 00:16:34,209
I've lost one eye.

205
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:37,709
In two months I'm scheduled for surgery
and will lose the other one, too.

206
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:41,417
I've always wanted to make
a super successful Bhojpuri film.

207
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,084
Starring Ravi Kishen or Manoj Tiwari.

208
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:47,417
But, that's not possible.

209
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,042
But, my film is shaping up well.

210
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:51,584
With Manny.

211
00:16:51,834 --> 00:16:53,792
Sir, it'll be an Oscar winner.

212
00:16:54,084 --> 00:16:55,667
- Really?
- Do you know who stars in it?

213
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,584
- Who?
- Immanuel Rajkumar Junior!

214
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:00,125
What's the film called?

215
00:17:00,334 --> 00:17:03,875
'Rajni Arrives, Dreams Revive'.

216
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:10,917
Manny, would you
like to say something?

217
00:17:12,167 --> 00:17:13,167
Okay.

218
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:17,459
Tell us, what are you scared of?

219
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:21,292
I'm scared of absolutely nothing.

220
00:17:21,584 --> 00:17:23,209
Fine. Tell us something
about yourself.

221
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:25,292
My name is Immanuel Rajkumar Junior.

222
00:17:25,459 --> 00:17:28,000
A few years ago,
I had a brush with osteosarcoma.

223
00:17:28,084 --> 00:17:31,250
And because of that
I lost this baby.

224
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:37,125
But, I'm a fighter and I...
I fought well.

225
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:40,500
And sir, I want to act
like Rajni sir.

226
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:43,000
I want to beat up the bad guys.

227
00:17:43,084 --> 00:17:45,417
Save the girl.
I want to risk my life for her.

228
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,250
I want to be a real-life hero.

229
00:17:48,334 --> 00:17:49,334
Applause!

230
00:17:52,209 --> 00:17:54,417
Does anybody else want to share?
Anybody else?

231
00:17:55,334 --> 00:17:56,500
Kizie Basu?

232
00:17:56,959 --> 00:17:58,292
This is a surprise.

233
00:17:58,625 --> 00:17:59,750
First time.

234
00:18:03,209 --> 00:18:04,792
Sir, I just want to say that

235
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:07,334
you don't need to be popular
to be a hero.

236
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:10,125
Even the boy-next-door
can be a hero.

237
00:18:30,167 --> 00:18:32,917
Why does my bike always conk off
in front of you?

238
00:18:35,334 --> 00:18:36,750
Are you really an alien?

239
00:18:40,167 --> 00:18:44,000
I love you... always, forever.

240
00:18:44,209 --> 00:18:45,792
- Always, forever?
- Yes!

241
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,584
Always, forever?

242
00:18:47,834 --> 00:18:49,292
Always, forever.

243
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,792
Always, forever?

244
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,334
Always, forever.

245
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,334
Always, forever?

246
00:18:55,542 --> 00:18:56,375
Always, forever.

247
00:18:56,542 --> 00:18:58,102
What's this 'always, forever' business?

248
00:18:58,542 --> 00:19:00,917
It's their 'always, forever' policy.

249
00:19:01,209 --> 00:19:03,500
Their hearts beat
only for each other.

250
00:19:03,667 --> 00:19:05,917
Always, forever.

251
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:09,334
Do you always say
such irritating things?

252
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:10,875
Always.

253
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:14,459
Nothing is forever.

254
00:19:14,542 --> 00:19:15,584
Actually, you're right.

255
00:19:15,667 --> 00:19:18,250
I can't wait for you endlessly.

256
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,084
Why don't you come?
I'll drop you.

257
00:19:20,917 --> 00:19:22,459
I'll save you some time.

258
00:19:23,709 --> 00:19:25,459
Trust me. Look at me.

259
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,209
Come on. Trust me.

260
00:19:30,834 --> 00:19:31,834
Get in.

261
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:44,292
- Kizie Basu.
- Yes?

262
00:19:44,792 --> 00:19:47,792
You shouldn't be riding
with a stranger on his bike.

263
00:19:49,084 --> 00:19:50,542
What if I were to kidnap you?

264
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:52,167
Kidnap?

265
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:55,084
And where would you take me?

266
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,584
Shall I tell you?

267
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,917
This is the favourite spot for both,
serial killers and kissers.

268
00:20:13,709 --> 00:20:14,709
Come.

269
00:20:42,584 --> 00:20:45,542
It's beautiful.

270
00:20:46,834 --> 00:20:48,042
Thank you.

271
00:20:48,459 --> 00:20:51,084
Not you. This place.

272
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,084
Yeah, of course.

273
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:00,000
But, at this very spot,
an ex told me the same thing.

274
00:21:00,084 --> 00:21:01,667
You're so beautiful.

275
00:21:02,834 --> 00:21:04,334
And what did you reply?

276
00:21:04,459 --> 00:21:05,917
"Thank you. I know."

277
00:21:08,167 --> 00:21:10,209
Do you get all your girlfriends here?

278
00:21:10,292 --> 00:21:11,292
No.

279
00:21:11,917 --> 00:21:13,709
Just the aliens.

280
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:16,584
Ones with these small spaceships.

281
00:21:17,417 --> 00:21:19,625
The spaceship is called Pushpinder.

282
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:23,167
Pushpinder! A Punjabi!

283
00:21:24,292 --> 00:21:26,125
Wassup, bro!

284
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:49,500
- Listen to this.
- What is it?

285
00:21:49,584 --> 00:21:51,084
- My favourite song.
- Okay.

286
00:21:51,917 --> 00:21:52,792
Which film is it from?

287
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:54,292
It's not from a film.

288
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:56,584
It's from an album by Abhimanyu Veer.

289
00:21:57,375 --> 00:21:58,084
Great.

290
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,292
'I'm Yours.'

291
00:22:00,292 --> 00:22:01,292
Oh!

292
00:22:06,459 --> 00:22:07,250
Yeah.

293
00:22:07,334 --> 00:22:09,292
- Did you like it?
- It's very boring.

294
00:22:10,209 --> 00:22:11,042
Sorry.

295
00:22:11,167 --> 00:22:12,167
Sorry.

296
00:22:13,792 --> 00:22:15,959
- Of course.
- What?

297
00:22:17,459 --> 00:22:18,959
Since it's not from a film.

298
00:22:19,042 --> 00:22:20,584
Hold on. I'm into popular music.

299
00:22:20,667 --> 00:22:22,250
I like all the chartbusters.

300
00:22:22,417 --> 00:22:24,000
'Saturday-Saturday.'

301
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:26,584
'Girlfriend Gone Bad', 'Bad Guy.'

302
00:22:26,792 --> 00:22:28,417
Such rubbish!

303
00:22:28,792 --> 00:22:29,917
Oh, was it a flop album?

304
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,250
It was a smash hit.
Many years ago.

305
00:22:32,417 --> 00:22:33,959
And for many years.

306
00:22:34,125 --> 00:22:37,084
If Honey Singh would've sung it,
it would still be a hit.

307
00:22:38,042 --> 00:22:39,167
My favourite.

308
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:45,125
- Really?
- What?

309
00:22:45,334 --> 00:22:46,709
No... what?

310
00:22:47,125 --> 00:22:48,459
I did something?

311
00:22:49,084 --> 00:22:50,084
Nothing.

312
00:22:50,959 --> 00:22:54,292
Then why are you giving me
the 'angry girlfriend' look?

313
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:59,875
Do you think you look cool
with the cigarette?

314
00:23:00,292 --> 00:23:02,584
Millions of people
are dying with cancer, Manny.

315
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:04,917
And not being able to breathe
isn't easy.

316
00:23:05,084 --> 00:23:06,125
I don't smoke.

317
00:23:09,084 --> 00:23:11,209
Only a lit cigarette can kill.

318
00:23:11,542 --> 00:23:15,334
And I've taken away its power.

319
00:23:15,542 --> 00:23:17,292
So, it's just a metaphor.

320
00:23:19,334 --> 00:23:20,334
Whatever.

321
00:23:20,792 --> 00:23:21,875
It's not cool.

322
00:23:21,959 --> 00:23:23,000
Yes, of course.

323
00:23:24,375 --> 00:23:27,084
And I'm not your girlfriend.

324
00:23:27,459 --> 00:23:30,500
Like, not now or ever?

325
00:23:32,334 --> 00:23:33,334
Never ever!

326
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:35,625
Liar!

327
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,500
He's very arrogant.

328
00:23:43,875 --> 00:23:45,000
"Liar!"

329
00:23:48,542 --> 00:23:54,625
I will never meet him again.

330
00:23:57,167 --> 00:23:59,084
He sat between his parents

331
00:23:59,417 --> 00:24:01,542
and when I gave him a cup of tea

332
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:03,792
my hands did not shake.

333
00:24:04,084 --> 00:24:05,334
But, his..

334
00:24:05,584 --> 00:24:09,667
He rattled the cup
right off the saucer into his lap.

335
00:24:10,209 --> 00:24:14,042
I see my family and friends
in these people sitting here.

336
00:24:15,125 --> 00:24:17,042
I can't bear to see their pain.

337
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:22,792
I feel like giving them a tight hug,
to mend their broken lives.

338
00:24:24,125 --> 00:24:26,500
My life feels broken, too.

339
00:24:26,584 --> 00:24:27,792
Please mend it.

340
00:24:27,875 --> 00:24:31,584
One son and one daughter later
our lives were whole.

341
00:24:32,334 --> 00:24:34,750
Kenneth was utterly devoted
to his children.

342
00:24:35,375 --> 00:24:38,709
He loved his son
but he spoilt his little girl.

343
00:24:40,042 --> 00:24:42,167
- Who's the dead guy?
- Kenneth D'Costa.

344
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:43,250
I see.

345
00:24:44,667 --> 00:24:47,250
- Was he Kizie's relative?
- Have you lost it?

346
00:24:51,459 --> 00:24:52,459
Yours?

347
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:01,667
Are you guys here for free food?

348
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,209
Food doesn't get served here.

349
00:25:03,292 --> 00:25:05,167
Will both of you
please shut up! Quiet.

350
00:25:05,667 --> 00:25:06,667
Sorry.

351
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:10,250
You are both nuts.
Is this any place for romance?

352
00:25:10,334 --> 00:25:13,625
- We are doing no such thing.
- I am. Aren't you? Feel free to.

353
00:25:13,709 --> 00:25:16,209
I'm begging you. Please shut up.

354
00:25:16,292 --> 00:25:18,292
I won't. Why should I?

355
00:25:18,459 --> 00:25:20,417
My name's Immanuel Rajkumar Junior.

356
00:25:20,584 --> 00:25:22,084
And I'm Jagdish Pandey.

357
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:24,917
And I haven't worn underpants today.

358
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,334
Ditto! I haven't either.

359
00:25:27,417 --> 00:25:29,167
And I've never had sex!

360
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:30,542
I...

361
00:25:33,709 --> 00:25:34,709
have...

362
00:25:40,917 --> 00:25:42,625
Never mind, Manny.

363
00:25:42,709 --> 00:25:43,834
You never told me?

364
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:46,084
Let's talk later.
Let's go from here.

365
00:25:50,584 --> 00:25:51,875
Really sorry.

366
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:02,500
Manny, you almost got us into trouble.

367
00:26:14,375 --> 00:26:16,084
Manny, left.

368
00:26:16,542 --> 00:26:18,167
- Is your house on the left?
- Yes.

369
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:19,250
Of course.

370
00:26:22,084 --> 00:26:23,709
That's it. That's it.

371
00:26:27,917 --> 00:26:29,084
Thank you.

372
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:30,334
Thank you.

373
00:26:32,542 --> 00:26:35,834
So, what have you decided?
Will you play the heroine?

374
00:26:36,542 --> 00:26:38,959
I might. But, on one condition.

375
00:26:39,667 --> 00:26:42,000
You will listen to this first.

376
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:44,500
Boring.

377
00:26:44,834 --> 00:26:46,209
Do you want a heroine?

378
00:26:47,417 --> 00:26:48,750
You don't have a choice.

379
00:26:49,167 --> 00:26:50,893
The film hasn't started
but the tantrums have begun.

380
00:26:50,917 --> 00:26:52,375
You're surely my heroine.

381
00:26:53,375 --> 00:26:55,625
- Pushpinder bro, take care of her.
- Bye!

382
00:26:55,959 --> 00:26:57,417
I'm yours...

383
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,000
I'm yours...

384
00:26:59,084 --> 00:27:00,584
I'm yours...

385
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:04,250
Manny, you're croaking.
You've ruined my sleep.

386
00:27:04,334 --> 00:27:05,709
I'm yours, my darling.

387
00:28:33,084 --> 00:28:35,375
Here, Manny, have some milk.

388
00:29:15,209 --> 00:29:17,542
- Stop it, JP.
- But, what did I do?

389
00:29:17,667 --> 00:29:18,667
I don't care.

390
00:29:18,709 --> 00:29:21,417
I have so many problems and you...

391
00:29:21,459 --> 00:29:24,084
- Not my problem. Just stop it.
- What did I do?

392
00:29:24,167 --> 00:29:26,625
- You loved me very much till yesterday.
- Now I don't!

393
00:29:26,709 --> 00:29:29,125
I'm going to lose my sight...

394
00:29:36,292 --> 00:29:37,584
How's the fish?

395
00:29:37,875 --> 00:29:38,875
What?

396
00:29:40,167 --> 00:29:42,584
Kizie, how's the fish?

397
00:29:43,167 --> 00:29:45,375
It's awesome, Ma. Too sweet.

398
00:29:47,042 --> 00:29:48,042
Sweet?

399
00:29:51,167 --> 00:29:52,709
I'm sure it's that boy.

400
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,459
At this age, it's always a boy.

401
00:29:55,792 --> 00:29:56,792
Manny?

402
00:30:12,584 --> 00:30:13,417
Hi.

403
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:14,167
Manny!

404
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:16,375
Are you looking for me?
I love your t-shirt.

405
00:30:16,459 --> 00:30:17,250
Thank you.

406
00:30:17,375 --> 00:30:19,250
But, what are you doing here?

407
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:21,834
Kizie Basu, I heard your songs.

408
00:30:22,584 --> 00:30:24,917
- Manny, Ma and Dad are downstairs.
- What an album!

409
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,834
- What amazing songs.
- Right?

410
00:30:26,875 --> 00:30:28,167
This Abhimanyu's deep.

411
00:30:28,459 --> 00:30:30,000
- He's so deep!
- But, tell me...

412
00:30:30,084 --> 00:30:31,209
I'm yours when?

413
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:34,917
I mean, the song. 'I'm Yours'.

414
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,959
What's after?
What happens 'When I'm yours'?

415
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,542
He vanished.

416
00:30:38,667 --> 00:30:40,500
Abhimanyu Veer vanished into thin air.

417
00:30:40,584 --> 00:30:42,334
He never completed the song.

418
00:30:42,542 --> 00:30:45,459
That's the problem with new artists.
They start but never finish.

419
00:30:45,709 --> 00:30:48,334
Then there's Rajni sir.
He starts one task but finishes two.

420
00:30:48,459 --> 00:30:49,167
Correct.

421
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:51,042
Of course. Rajni sir's great.

422
00:30:51,209 --> 00:30:54,000
He fires a bullet
which splits in four.

423
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:57,167
If Hollywood does it... wow!
But if Tollywood does it... how?

424
00:30:57,709 --> 00:31:00,334
And since when have you
started watching Rajnikant films?

425
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:01,834
Shut up. I...

426
00:31:01,917 --> 00:31:03,917
Yes? Hello.

427
00:31:03,959 --> 00:31:04,625
Hello.

428
00:31:04,709 --> 00:31:05,875
- Yo, bro.
- I'm going in.

429
00:31:05,959 --> 00:31:07,042
Hey, JP.

430
00:31:07,417 --> 00:31:09,584
You won't go inside.
Or our friendship is over.

431
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:10,459
Listen.

432
00:31:10,542 --> 00:31:12,209
We have to find this Abhimanyu Veer.

433
00:31:12,625 --> 00:31:14,042
Yes, bro... I'm listening.

434
00:31:14,125 --> 00:31:15,167
I love you, Manny.

435
00:31:16,292 --> 00:31:18,435
Stop crying, please.
I'll be there in 10 minutes, okay?

436
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:20,125
- I love you, too.
- Why is he crying?

437
00:31:20,209 --> 00:31:21,292
- Got eggs at home?
- What?

438
00:31:21,375 --> 00:31:22,459
How many? Get them all.

439
00:31:22,542 --> 00:31:23,584
I can't, Manny.

440
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:25,709
I can't come.
Ma and Dad are downstairs.

441
00:31:25,792 --> 00:31:26,792
"Seize the day!"

442
00:31:26,875 --> 00:31:29,395
- Stop with the film dialogues.
- "Make those 10 minutes count."

443
00:31:30,709 --> 00:31:31,834
Please!

444
00:31:34,459 --> 00:31:35,542
Okay.

445
00:31:36,375 --> 00:31:37,542
Always, forever...

446
00:31:39,292 --> 00:31:40,584
- Never ever!
- JP.

447
00:31:41,875 --> 00:31:42,959
- Always, forever.
- JP!

448
00:31:43,834 --> 00:31:44,917
- Come.
- Never ever.

449
00:31:47,042 --> 00:31:48,125
Always, forever.

450
00:31:49,917 --> 00:31:51,042
Never ever.

451
00:31:52,625 --> 00:31:54,167
- Always forever.
- Break up?

452
00:31:56,792 --> 00:31:59,084
- Sorry.
- No... betrayal.

453
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:02,792
She always said
that she would be my eyes.

454
00:32:03,125 --> 00:32:04,792
Bro, don't stress.

455
00:32:05,209 --> 00:32:06,542
It's time for revenge.

456
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:08,667
Manny, revenge isn't going
to alleviate my pain.

457
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:12,084
It's not about alleviation
but revolution.

458
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:13,167
Hold this. Come here.

459
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:14,959
- What should I do with it?
- Come here.

460
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:16,792
Throw it on her.

461
00:32:16,875 --> 00:32:19,000
- No way!
- Lob it.

462
00:32:19,084 --> 00:32:20,792
- Throw away all your anger.
- Did it hit?

463
00:32:20,875 --> 00:32:22,375
Channel all your anger and throw.

464
00:32:23,042 --> 00:32:25,459
- It's a hit!
- It hit.

465
00:32:25,625 --> 00:32:26,792
Try it. Go for it.

466
00:32:27,292 --> 00:32:29,667
- Go on, Kizie.
- Throw. I'm going to throw one now.

467
00:32:29,709 --> 00:32:30,709
Aim for the bedroom.

468
00:32:30,792 --> 00:32:33,226
- How do I know where her bedroom is?
- It's there. On the left.

469
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:34,292
Throw it.

470
00:32:34,625 --> 00:32:36,250
Score!

471
00:32:36,334 --> 00:32:37,334
Yes!

472
00:32:38,167 --> 00:32:38,792
Oh, God.

473
00:32:38,875 --> 00:32:40,000
Hello, Damania ma'am.

474
00:32:40,084 --> 00:32:41,792
Manny, what are you doing here?

475
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,542
Ma'am, your daughter
broke my friend's heart.

476
00:32:44,625 --> 00:32:45,625
Go inside.

477
00:32:45,667 --> 00:32:48,125
We're here to break your house
not your heart.

478
00:32:48,334 --> 00:32:50,625
But remember,
you can still call my dad.

479
00:32:50,709 --> 00:32:52,250
You have his number, right?

480
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,667
Go inside. Go on.

481
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:55,185
- Let's get back to it, bro.
- Really?

482
00:32:55,209 --> 00:32:56,500
With all your might.

483
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Score!

484
00:32:58,625 --> 00:32:59,625
Listen.

485
00:33:00,584 --> 00:33:01,584
One for the...

486
00:33:01,667 --> 00:33:03,084
I want to meet Abhimanyu Veer.

487
00:33:03,584 --> 00:33:05,375
The song must get completed.

488
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:07,292
- It's not possible.
- Why?

489
00:33:07,375 --> 00:33:09,542
I've tried desperately.
He has disappeared.

490
00:33:09,667 --> 00:33:12,875
Even Invisible Man
was ultimately found.

491
00:33:12,959 --> 00:33:14,750
Abhimanyu Veer is hardly a challenge.

492
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,625
What say?

493
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,584
When am I starting shoot?

494
00:33:19,792 --> 00:33:22,459
Bro, we've got our heroine!

495
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:23,834
Kizie Basu.

496
00:33:23,917 --> 00:33:26,959
The name's enough
to rock the country.

497
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,917
Rascal, are you here to avenge me
or start your own love story?

498
00:33:30,959 --> 00:33:31,959
- Sorry.
- Concentrate!

499
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,959
Come on, Kizie. Throw them.

500
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,792
What an aim.

501
00:33:35,875 --> 00:33:38,417
Hold this. Aim at the kitchen

502
00:33:38,667 --> 00:33:40,667
I have no idea where the kitchen is.

503
00:33:40,959 --> 00:33:45,125
These scenes highlighted
in yellow are Manny's.

504
00:33:45,334 --> 00:33:46,667
And the orange ones are mine.

505
00:33:46,834 --> 00:33:48,393
- And which is the next scene?
- This one.

506
00:33:48,417 --> 00:33:50,709
We'll shoot your intro.
What say, JP?

507
00:33:50,792 --> 00:33:52,375
What was it? The rain sequence.

508
00:33:52,459 --> 00:33:54,584
Damsel in distress.
In rain-soaked tresses.

509
00:33:56,459 --> 00:33:57,792
I'm no damsel in distress.

510
00:33:58,042 --> 00:33:59,042
I'm Bengali.

511
00:33:59,375 --> 00:34:01,000
And Bengali girls are dangerous.

512
00:34:01,834 --> 00:34:03,500
'Rajni Arrives, Dreams Revive'.

513
00:34:03,584 --> 00:34:05,250
Shot number 1. Take number 1.

514
00:34:05,584 --> 00:34:06,584
Action.

515
00:35:54,625 --> 00:35:57,459
And then our worst fears came true.

516
00:35:57,875 --> 00:36:01,042
JP got operated
and lost his sight.

517
00:36:01,375 --> 00:36:04,917
But, we had promised each other
to complete the film.

518
00:36:05,084 --> 00:36:06,625
So... action.

519
00:36:39,209 --> 00:36:41,792
Though the lion is called
the King of the jungle,

520
00:36:41,875 --> 00:36:44,000
the lioness has all the power.

521
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:48,917
In her lifetime,
a lioness mates with multiple lions.

522
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:51,000
It is believed
that in this excited state,

523
00:36:51,084 --> 00:36:54,459
a lioness can have sex
anywhere between 20-40 times

524
00:36:54,542 --> 00:36:57,000
without even taking a break
for food or water.

525
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:58,643
When the lioness is away hunting...

526
00:36:58,667 --> 00:37:00,292
Such stamina!

527
00:37:00,375 --> 00:37:04,167
The lion is unable to mate even once.

528
00:37:05,125 --> 00:37:07,417
It's all a lie.
They must be on an energy drink.

529
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:10,375
When the lioness returns from her hunt

530
00:37:10,542 --> 00:37:12,167
the lion loses his cool...

531
00:37:23,042 --> 00:37:24,834
What do you do?

532
00:37:25,292 --> 00:37:27,584
I'm an astronaut.
I'm going to NASA next week.

533
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:30,917
You? A scientist?

534
00:37:31,584 --> 00:37:35,625
Actually, my father is very rich
so I don't need to do anything.

535
00:37:39,042 --> 00:37:40,625
- You should.
- Sure.

536
00:37:40,959 --> 00:37:42,584
You're not that young anymore.

537
00:37:47,834 --> 00:37:50,250
- Why are you joking?
- Me? It's you who's being funny.

538
00:37:50,334 --> 00:37:53,084
- Is this any food to offer a guest?
- Isn't the salt less?

539
00:37:53,167 --> 00:37:54,042
Stop it, dad.

540
00:37:54,125 --> 00:37:55,459
More like, absent.

541
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:57,042
- What?
- Yes.

542
00:37:57,125 --> 00:38:00,165
- These potatoes are like rocks.
- Immanuel says there's no salt in the food.

543
00:38:00,334 --> 00:38:01,750
- What?
- Oh my God.

544
00:38:02,084 --> 00:38:03,709
- What happened?
- Salt.

545
00:38:07,375 --> 00:38:09,459
Didn't you like the food?

546
00:38:11,917 --> 00:38:14,226
Do you know that she secretly
watches reality shows at night?

547
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:15,084
- What?
- Yes.

548
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:16,893
And she also votes
for her favourite contestants.

549
00:38:16,917 --> 00:38:18,000
No, Ma. He's lying.

550
00:38:18,084 --> 00:38:19,268
- That's my phone.
- That's the one she uses.

551
00:38:19,292 --> 00:38:20,542
- Look. Check it.
- No!

552
00:38:20,625 --> 00:38:21,959
What is this, Kizie?

553
00:38:22,209 --> 00:38:25,459
And she's becoming violent.

554
00:38:25,917 --> 00:38:27,834
- Ma...
- I'm very disappointed with you, Kizie.

555
00:38:27,917 --> 00:38:30,167
- He's lying.
- You don't listen to me anymore.

556
00:38:30,334 --> 00:38:32,209
I don't do any of that.
Honestly!

557
00:38:32,292 --> 00:38:33,292
Liar!

558
00:38:33,917 --> 00:38:36,334
- Why did you tell Mom?
- I didn't. Your dad did.

559
00:38:36,417 --> 00:38:38,125
I've been trying
to say it since 25 years.

560
00:38:38,209 --> 00:38:39,500
I saw a chance today.

561
00:38:39,709 --> 00:38:41,042
There's less salt in the food.

562
00:38:41,125 --> 00:38:42,292
Very good.

563
00:38:43,417 --> 00:38:45,209
If you don't like the food,
don't have it.

564
00:38:45,375 --> 00:38:47,209
Don't force yourself.

565
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:57,917
I'm diabetic.

566
00:39:06,875 --> 00:39:09,834
Tomorrow you bring
all your reports to me, all right?

567
00:39:10,084 --> 00:39:11,518
We'll have a separate consultation on...

568
00:39:11,542 --> 00:39:12,417
Kizie.

569
00:39:12,542 --> 00:39:13,250
Manny?

570
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:14,209
Sir.

571
00:39:14,292 --> 00:39:15,500
Manny, what are you doing?

572
00:39:15,584 --> 00:39:16,625
Get up.

573
00:39:16,792 --> 00:39:18,552
- What happened?
- Sir, her life's in danger.

574
00:39:18,584 --> 00:39:19,667
- What?
- Come, come.

575
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:21,084
- Manny!
- I'm going, sir.

576
00:39:21,167 --> 00:39:23,250
Manny, what happened?
Take me along.

577
00:39:23,334 --> 00:39:24,667
I want to show you something.

578
00:39:24,709 --> 00:39:26,726
- But Manny, what happened?
- See, you have to help me.

579
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:31,250
Abhimanyu Veer's song is driving me mad.

580
00:39:31,709 --> 00:39:33,417
- You're welcome.
- Yeah, but...

581
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:34,935
Don't you think
we need closure on it?

582
00:39:34,959 --> 00:39:36,792
Shouldn't we know how it ends?

583
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,834
But, it's very tough to find him.

584
00:39:41,334 --> 00:39:42,417
Is it?

585
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:43,750
- Yes.
- Have you tried?

586
00:39:43,834 --> 00:39:44,917
I...

587
00:39:45,417 --> 00:39:46,792
Here.

588
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:52,292
I think I've found Invisible Man.

589
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,084
"Dear Immanuel Rajkumar Junior.

590
00:40:03,542 --> 00:40:05,167
"Thank you for writing to me.

591
00:40:05,209 --> 00:40:07,417
"That incomplete song was my last one.

592
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,459
"You can't create music.
It flows from within.

593
00:40:09,584 --> 00:40:10,959
"So, to answer your question...

594
00:40:11,042 --> 00:40:14,709
"Forget fans, I can't even complete
the song for myself, sir."

595
00:40:15,209 --> 00:40:17,125
He called me 'sir'.

596
00:40:17,834 --> 00:40:20,042
"And so, your question
will remain unanswered.

597
00:40:20,292 --> 00:40:23,334
"But I'm glad to know
that you and your friend Kizie Basu...

598
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,209
"liked my song.

599
00:40:26,292 --> 00:40:29,750
"Thank you for your generous email.
Regards, Abhimanyu Veer."

600
00:40:37,459 --> 00:40:41,042
Dear Mr Abhimanyu Veer.

601
00:40:43,375 --> 00:40:46,750
Thank you for your reply.

602
00:40:49,917 --> 00:40:56,292
I don't know why
but I feel that you will understand me.

603
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:05,709
I might not live for very long.

604
00:41:08,625 --> 00:41:10,125
And your songs...

605
00:41:12,292 --> 00:41:15,042
capture the loss of a loved one.

606
00:41:15,667 --> 00:41:19,584
Ma, Dad, Manny...

607
00:41:20,959 --> 00:41:27,125
Is there no way
of saving them from this hurt?

608
00:41:28,084 --> 00:41:29,834
I want to meet you.

609
00:41:30,709 --> 00:41:31,709
Please.

610
00:41:31,917 --> 00:41:34,000
Love, Kizie Basu.

611
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:45,000
Elbow out.

612
00:41:50,209 --> 00:41:52,792
It shouldn't slump. Like this.

613
00:41:54,292 --> 00:41:55,834
Do you know how to dance?

614
00:41:55,917 --> 00:41:57,125
Sure, why not?

615
00:41:57,917 --> 00:42:03,042
Engineering students know it all,
but engineering.

616
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,625
Come here. Give me your hand.

617
00:42:07,959 --> 00:42:08,959
Fine?

618
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:11,209
One, two...

619
00:42:15,625 --> 00:42:17,042
Sorry, I forgot.

620
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:18,250
What?

621
00:42:19,625 --> 00:42:21,292
Son, Pushpinder.

622
00:42:21,584 --> 00:42:23,959
Let's dance together.

623
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:25,459
The hand goes here.

624
00:42:30,792 --> 00:42:32,584
Are you going with Manny?

625
00:46:44,417 --> 00:46:46,167
I told you I'm awesome.

626
00:46:49,542 --> 00:46:50,542
Hello.

627
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:55,500
Kizie?

628
00:46:58,209 --> 00:47:01,042
You can't leave me high and dry.

629
00:47:01,417 --> 00:47:02,417
Shut up.

630
00:47:09,125 --> 00:47:11,959
Manny, it's 1 am.

631
00:47:12,959 --> 00:47:13,959
So?

632
00:47:15,459 --> 00:47:17,834
I should sleep.

633
00:47:21,750 --> 00:47:22,750
Seri.

634
00:47:22,875 --> 00:47:23,875
Seri?

635
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:26,334
Is that Tamil?

636
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Yes.

637
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:32,250
Means okay in Tamil.

638
00:47:33,292 --> 00:47:34,875
I like the sound of the word.

639
00:47:35,625 --> 00:47:36,625
Seri.

640
00:47:37,042 --> 00:47:41,959
Manny, from now on,
'Seri' is our word.

641
00:47:46,209 --> 00:47:47,542
Seri, Kizie Basu.

642
00:47:49,625 --> 00:47:53,834
Seri... Immanuel Rajkumar Junior.

643
00:48:01,209 --> 00:48:03,459
It's often said,
love is like falling asleep.

644
00:48:03,917 --> 00:48:08,375
It happens slowly, then all at once.

645
00:48:08,709 --> 00:48:10,417
It happened to me, too.

646
00:48:10,875 --> 00:48:13,792
I fell asleep
while talking to Manny.

647
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:54,917
"Dear Ms Basu.

648
00:48:55,167 --> 00:48:58,292
"It's tough to answer your questions
on email.

649
00:48:58,542 --> 00:49:02,375
"Sometimes the right words evade you.

650
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,042
"But, if you're ever in Paris,
let's meet.

651
00:49:06,709 --> 00:49:08,667
"Yours sincerely, Abhimanyu Veer."

652
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:09,792
- Ma!
- What happened?

653
00:49:09,875 --> 00:49:11,709
- Ma... Dad!
- What's wrong?

654
00:49:12,625 --> 00:49:13,917
Nothing. Sorry, Dad.

655
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,250
Then why did you scream?

656
00:49:15,459 --> 00:49:16,875
This!

657
00:49:17,542 --> 00:49:18,792
"Dear Ms Basu.

658
00:49:18,875 --> 00:49:22,042
"It's tough to answer your questions
on email.

659
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:25,542
"Sometimes the right words evade you.

660
00:49:26,250 --> 00:49:28,625
"But, if you're ever in Paris,
let's meet."

661
00:49:29,209 --> 00:49:31,334
You can't go to Paris
with him, Kizie.

662
00:49:32,584 --> 00:49:34,292
You don't even know him
well enough.

663
00:49:34,375 --> 00:49:36,042
You don't know him!

664
00:49:37,125 --> 00:49:39,459
What do you mean?
What are you trying to tell me?

665
00:49:39,542 --> 00:49:41,334
Ma, stop over reacting.

666
00:49:41,625 --> 00:49:44,542
Am I? Really?

667
00:49:44,625 --> 00:49:47,209
Do you seriously think
that I'm over reacting?

668
00:49:47,542 --> 00:49:49,167
Just tell me the truth.

669
00:49:50,292 --> 00:49:52,625
- Is your virginity safe?
- What's wrong with you?

670
00:49:52,709 --> 00:49:55,250
- What's wrong with me?
- Yes! It's safe.

671
00:49:55,375 --> 00:49:57,335
I've locked it away safely
in a Swiss bank locker.

672
00:49:57,375 --> 00:49:59,875
- Get it back when I'm dead.
- Kizie!

673
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:02,500
What's this?

674
00:50:13,625 --> 00:50:14,625
I'm sorry.

675
00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:17,542
I'm sorry, Dad.

676
00:50:19,584 --> 00:50:21,250
I want to go to Paris.

677
00:50:21,792 --> 00:50:22,959
I have to go.

678
00:50:25,667 --> 00:50:27,250
Sweetheart, your mother is right.

679
00:50:27,875 --> 00:50:31,917
How can you go alone?
Your body can't take the travel.

680
00:50:32,209 --> 00:50:34,042
Dad, I'm fine.

681
00:50:34,125 --> 00:50:35,834
No, you're not, Kizie.

682
00:50:35,917 --> 00:50:37,250
Am I not saying that?

683
00:50:38,125 --> 00:50:39,625
Okay.

684
00:50:40,292 --> 00:50:42,292
Let me talk to Dr Jha.

685
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:44,500
If he gives permission then...

686
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:48,542
Kizie! Why are you saying that?

687
00:50:48,625 --> 00:50:49,917
I'm speaking to my daughter.

688
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,101
What are you saying?
If Dr Jha gives permission will you...

689
00:50:52,125 --> 00:50:54,542
- Dr Jha is the best person to...
- For what?

690
00:50:54,625 --> 00:50:56,792
Does every darn thing
have to be a fight?

691
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,750
- I don't know.
- Why?

692
00:51:06,209 --> 00:51:08,959
You said the PET scan report
was normal.

693
00:51:09,125 --> 00:51:12,042
I meant the cancer
was in control for the time being.

694
00:51:12,167 --> 00:51:15,750
I'm going just for a few days.
I'm not moving there permanently.

695
00:51:15,834 --> 00:51:19,334
I can't give you permission
to go alone.

696
00:51:19,542 --> 00:51:22,209
Alone? Manny's with me.

697
00:51:22,292 --> 00:51:25,625
Manny! I'd never give you permission
to go alone with him.

698
00:51:27,667 --> 00:51:29,334
You're talking like Ma now.

699
00:51:31,542 --> 00:51:33,417
Only on one condition.

700
00:51:33,959 --> 00:51:37,042
Only if Mrs Basu goes with you.

701
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:38,500
What?

702
00:51:39,709 --> 00:51:40,542
Ma!

703
00:51:40,625 --> 00:51:41,625
Me?

704
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,709
Ma will come with me.

705
00:51:44,917 --> 00:51:46,334
It's the perfect idea.

706
00:51:46,417 --> 00:51:47,459
Why me?

707
00:51:47,542 --> 00:51:49,042
Ma, you've never seen Paris.

708
00:51:49,125 --> 00:51:50,667
What will I do there?

709
00:52:10,834 --> 00:52:13,000
- Hello, Kizie Basu.
- Hello, Junior.

710
00:52:13,334 --> 00:52:17,084
Ladies and gentlemen,
hold onto your hearts.

711
00:52:17,125 --> 00:52:19,209
Here's presenting...

712
00:52:21,459 --> 00:52:22,709
- Manny?
- What?

713
00:52:25,375 --> 00:52:27,000
I've made all the travel bookings.

714
00:52:27,084 --> 00:52:29,792
Jamshedpur - Ranchi - Delhi...
And straight to...

715
00:52:30,417 --> 00:52:31,292
- Paris!
- Paris!

716
00:52:31,375 --> 00:52:32,459
Kizie Basu, Paris!

717
00:52:32,542 --> 00:52:34,625
- What are you saying?
- Seriously.

718
00:52:35,167 --> 00:52:37,542
Now, it's your turn...

719
00:52:38,750 --> 00:52:39,417
to...

720
00:52:39,542 --> 00:52:40,584
Of course, right?

721
00:52:42,750 --> 00:52:46,334
But you could have given me
this information on the phone.

722
00:52:46,584 --> 00:52:50,750
I could have.
But, I haven't come to give.

723
00:52:51,584 --> 00:52:54,334
I've come to receive. Kissie...

724
00:52:57,625 --> 00:53:01,250
I've heard that a first kiss
is very special.

725
00:53:02,667 --> 00:53:03,667
Yes.

726
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,292
Ask me.
I've had several first kisses.

727
00:53:06,375 --> 00:53:09,250
I was 15 and she, 17.
We were in the canteen...

728
00:53:09,375 --> 00:53:10,459
Manny!

729
00:53:16,250 --> 00:53:19,375
Why do I get the feeling
that our first kiss will be very special?

730
00:53:20,709 --> 00:53:22,334
Don't you feel the same?

731
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:23,792
I do.

732
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,042
You do?

733
00:53:25,209 --> 00:53:26,292
Okay...

734
00:53:29,292 --> 00:53:30,834
Come on. Get up.

735
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,084
- Hey!
- Leave.

736
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:34,875
You can't get rid of me
in Paris, Kizie Basu.

737
00:53:35,417 --> 00:53:36,834
- Out!
- Okay.

738
00:53:40,834 --> 00:53:41,834
Manny!

739
00:53:45,459 --> 00:53:46,459
Bye.

740
00:53:56,750 --> 00:53:58,875
Manny...

741
00:54:01,084 --> 00:54:04,375
instantly puts a smile on my face.

742
00:54:05,209 --> 00:54:06,959
Makes my heart leap.

743
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:08,584
Breaking news!

744
00:54:09,042 --> 00:54:11,959
Cancer can't stand your happiness.

745
00:54:56,709 --> 00:54:59,000
I couldn't see clearly.

746
00:54:59,459 --> 00:55:02,542
But, mom's rolling tears
made me sense her fear.

747
00:55:06,459 --> 00:55:08,792
Dad's false promises
were dripping with distress.

748
00:55:11,792 --> 00:55:13,375
I was scared, too.

749
00:55:17,084 --> 00:55:19,500
I was scared that I would
never be able to see

750
00:55:19,875 --> 00:55:21,709
Manny's stupid smile... ever again.

751
00:56:52,208 --> 00:56:54,417
Hi. I'm alive.

752
00:56:55,708 --> 00:56:58,333
I guess Kizie really means a latch.

753
00:57:04,833 --> 00:57:07,458
But now, I've found reason
to latch on to life.

754
00:57:10,083 --> 00:57:13,542
However, I was scared to meet
that reason in my current state.

755
00:57:14,667 --> 00:57:17,833
I guess, we were all scared.

756
00:57:18,333 --> 00:57:21,667
Ma and Dad were scared
of the medical terms.

757
00:57:22,750 --> 00:57:25,625
The more experienced the doctor,
the more complicated the words.

758
00:57:26,542 --> 00:57:28,708
Dad's nodding in agreement...

759
00:57:29,208 --> 00:57:31,542
but isn't processing any information.

760
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:35,542
My team and I are right here.
Okay?

761
00:57:36,375 --> 00:57:37,375
Okay.

762
00:57:37,958 --> 00:57:40,500
All the reports by 5 o'clock, please.

763
00:57:40,583 --> 00:57:41,875
Okay. Sure, sir.

764
00:57:45,417 --> 00:57:46,417
Dad...

765
00:57:47,750 --> 00:57:48,750
Manny?

766
00:57:48,958 --> 00:57:50,500
He's waiting outside.

767
00:57:51,250 --> 00:57:52,625
He wants to meet you.

768
00:58:09,417 --> 00:58:10,750
How's Kizie, sir?

769
00:58:11,417 --> 00:58:12,417
Better.

770
00:58:21,708 --> 00:58:23,750
She doesn't want to meet you.

771
00:58:26,750 --> 00:58:28,583
I'm not here to meet her, either.

772
00:58:29,125 --> 00:58:30,500
I came to see you.

773
00:58:32,167 --> 00:58:33,292
Really?

774
00:58:34,292 --> 00:58:35,708
No... I'm lying.

775
00:58:39,708 --> 00:58:41,542
I'm not going anywhere.

776
00:59:17,458 --> 00:59:21,167
Kizie, love... the door's open.
Don't worry. Okay?

777
00:59:21,417 --> 00:59:22,625
Thanks, Dad.

778
00:59:22,833 --> 00:59:24,042
Good night.

779
00:59:29,750 --> 00:59:30,750
It's Manny.

780
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:32,500
I know, Dad.

781
00:59:34,583 --> 00:59:36,125
It's not fair to him.

782
00:59:36,583 --> 00:59:39,542
It's my problem.
He doesn't need to suffer through it.

783
00:59:40,708 --> 00:59:43,250
Correct. Absolutely.

784
00:59:44,417 --> 00:59:46,583
We didn't need to suffer, too.

785
00:59:46,917 --> 00:59:51,125
We should've left you
at an orphanage in Zambia.

786
00:59:51,417 --> 00:59:52,417
Right?

787
00:59:55,917 --> 01:00:00,042
Let him decide
whether he wants to suffer or not.

788
01:00:00,875 --> 01:00:01,875
Okay?

789
01:00:16,417 --> 01:00:17,667
Kizie Basu.

790
01:00:18,292 --> 01:00:19,292
Immanuel.

791
01:00:20,875 --> 01:00:22,250
Are you okay?

792
01:00:24,375 --> 01:00:26,000
Not really.

793
01:00:27,458 --> 01:00:28,625
I'm not okay.

794
01:00:29,167 --> 01:00:30,542
Tell me what happened.

795
01:00:31,542 --> 01:00:33,500
Manny, I want to go to Paris.

796
01:00:33,792 --> 01:00:35,667
I want to meet Abhimanyu Veer.

797
01:00:36,167 --> 01:00:37,917
Why is 'I'm Yours' incomplete?

798
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,875
And were it to get complete,
how would it end?

799
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,875
- I need to know.
- And where do I feature in all this?

800
01:01:13,375 --> 01:01:14,792
I hope you know...

801
01:01:14,958 --> 01:01:19,292
You ignoring me won't change
my feelings for you.

802
01:01:22,958 --> 01:01:26,750
Manny, we can't be together.

803
01:01:27,292 --> 01:01:28,292
Why not?

804
01:01:28,792 --> 01:01:31,333
It can't be...

805
01:01:32,292 --> 01:01:33,292
Friends?

806
01:01:33,917 --> 01:01:36,167
We can be friends, right?
Friends.

807
01:01:41,042 --> 01:01:42,667
- Friends.
- Friends.

808
01:01:43,167 --> 01:01:45,333
We're all friends.
You're a friend. I'm a friend.

809
01:01:45,417 --> 01:01:46,792
Okay, bro? We're all friends.

810
01:01:46,917 --> 01:01:47,917
Okay?

811
01:01:48,250 --> 01:01:48,958
Seri?

812
01:01:49,042 --> 01:01:50,042
Seri.

813
01:02:10,708 --> 01:02:12,708
She wants to go to Paris
with her ill health.

814
01:02:13,083 --> 01:02:14,792
She's only thinking about Paris.

815
01:02:14,875 --> 01:02:16,625
We're tired of explaining to her, doctor.

816
01:02:16,708 --> 01:02:19,292
Can you please explain
the seriousness of things to her?

817
01:02:19,542 --> 01:02:21,708
Kizie, it's very risky to travel.

818
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,542
Your immune system's very weak.

819
01:02:23,625 --> 01:02:27,292
Paris has doctors.

820
01:02:27,458 --> 01:02:28,750
I'll be okay.

821
01:02:29,083 --> 01:02:30,750
I've given my advice.

822
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:33,833
Finally, it's a family decision, Mr Basu.

823
01:02:44,167 --> 01:02:46,083
Why the deathly silence?

824
01:02:48,958 --> 01:02:52,333
It's a personal family matter.
Else, I would've decided.

825
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:01,250
Come, time for bed.

826
01:03:04,208 --> 01:03:05,458
Didn't hear me?

827
01:03:15,875 --> 01:03:18,083
You won't be able to convince her.

828
01:03:18,292 --> 01:03:19,458
You can't.

829
01:03:20,792 --> 01:03:22,208
Will you have a beer?

830
01:03:22,333 --> 01:03:23,042
What?

831
01:03:23,125 --> 01:03:24,208
Beer.

832
01:03:24,875 --> 01:03:26,625
They've gone to sleep. Want one?

833
01:03:27,750 --> 01:03:29,875
Don't act silly.
You aren't allowed to drink.

834
01:03:29,958 --> 01:03:31,167
I know.

835
01:03:32,458 --> 01:03:33,458
But...

836
01:03:34,708 --> 01:03:36,500
sometimes it's fun being silly.

837
01:03:50,167 --> 01:03:52,375
So, you love Kizie, right?

838
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:58,500
Really?

839
01:04:03,208 --> 01:04:04,542
But, I know...

840
01:04:06,792 --> 01:04:10,042
and I really appreciate
your concern.

841
01:04:10,917 --> 01:04:13,458
But don't you feel that
in her current condition...

842
01:04:16,417 --> 01:04:17,875
it's a bit silly?

843
01:04:26,958 --> 01:04:31,417
When my leg was operated,
I told Dad...

844
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,625
Please don't cut my leg.

845
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,500
How will I...

846
01:04:39,208 --> 01:04:40,792
How will I play basketball?

847
01:04:41,167 --> 01:04:42,708
And he said the same thing.

848
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,292
Please don't be silly.

849
01:04:45,875 --> 01:04:47,500
I may have been acting silly.

850
01:04:48,583 --> 01:04:53,417
But, that one moment
changed my life completely.

851
01:04:56,958 --> 01:04:59,083
I played basketball
after the surgery, too.

852
01:05:00,542 --> 01:05:02,875
But, it didn't have
the same magic.

853
01:05:03,667 --> 01:05:07,500
When I jumped,
I didn't enjoy the flight.

854
01:05:07,667 --> 01:05:10,250
When I ran,
I didn't know why I was running.

855
01:05:11,083 --> 01:05:12,917
Losing a game was justified.

856
01:05:13,458 --> 01:05:18,375
And in a freak case when I won,
I didn't enjoy the success.

857
01:05:20,792 --> 01:05:23,917
I mean, there was a feeling
of being incomplete.

858
01:05:25,250 --> 01:05:30,083
Like Abhimanyu Veer's song.

859
01:05:34,042 --> 01:05:36,417
I dream big.

860
01:05:38,833 --> 01:05:41,750
But, I'm not as driven
to fulfil them.

861
01:05:43,042 --> 01:05:45,375
Kizie has a small dream.

862
01:05:46,125 --> 01:05:50,625
And I really want
to fulfil it for her.

863
01:05:56,750 --> 01:05:57,958
I know.

864
01:05:58,583 --> 01:06:00,083
I know it's a bit silly.

865
01:06:00,167 --> 01:06:04,000
Going to Paris in this condition,
is a bit silly.

866
01:06:04,958 --> 01:06:07,708
But to fulfil Kizie's dream...

867
01:06:10,292 --> 01:06:13,083
The fun in that silliness
is unparalleled.

868
01:07:50,125 --> 01:07:52,500
So, Kizie Basu...

869
01:07:52,875 --> 01:07:56,667
Are you going to meet
Abhimanyu Veer or Mr Manny?

870
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:06,708
You had a favourite dress
when you were eight.

871
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:10,375
You'd wear it every evening.

872
01:08:10,667 --> 01:08:13,417
You loved that dress
so much, Kizie Basu.

873
01:08:14,208 --> 01:08:17,000
I loved that dress
because you had stitched it for me.

874
01:08:18,458 --> 01:08:19,708
Yes.

875
01:08:20,417 --> 01:08:23,042
I should've stitched
this one, too.

876
01:08:23,375 --> 01:08:25,208
Isn't it too revealing?

877
01:08:27,167 --> 01:08:29,375
Ma, it's fine.

878
01:08:29,542 --> 01:08:31,917
Is it really? Really?

879
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,417
It's fine?

880
01:08:33,708 --> 01:08:35,417
Won't do.

881
01:09:18,542 --> 01:09:19,542
AV.

882
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:28,750
Cold coffee with ice cream anybody?

883
01:09:29,083 --> 01:09:30,667
- No, sir.
- No, sir.

884
01:09:31,583 --> 01:09:32,583
Come.

885
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:37,500
AV doesn't drink alcohol.
Only cold coffee.

886
01:09:40,458 --> 01:09:43,250
Alcohol is bad for the liver.
You shouldn't drink.

887
01:09:44,917 --> 01:09:47,042
What are you doing?

888
01:09:47,250 --> 01:09:49,208
Cigarette smoking
is injurious to health.

889
01:09:49,917 --> 01:09:51,167
It can lead to cancer.

890
01:09:51,333 --> 01:09:52,333
Oh.

891
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,708
But, you already have cancer.

892
01:09:54,958 --> 01:09:56,792
Go on. Smoke it.

893
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:00,292
AV, Kizie and Manny are big fans.

894
01:10:00,375 --> 01:10:04,250
Actually, sir... Kizie's a big fan.

895
01:10:04,583 --> 01:10:06,083
And you?

896
01:10:09,417 --> 01:10:11,083
I worship Rajnikant.

897
01:10:11,250 --> 01:10:12,500
Who's that?

898
01:10:18,167 --> 01:10:19,250
Just joking, mate.

899
01:10:19,417 --> 01:10:20,500
I love Rajnikant.

900
01:10:20,833 --> 01:10:23,625
Aka Thalaiva. Woohoo!

901
01:10:27,833 --> 01:10:31,792
Sir, 'I'm Yours' is my favourite album.

902
01:10:32,375 --> 01:10:33,958
Mine, too. High five.

903
01:10:34,875 --> 01:10:37,125
Why didn't you complete the title song?

904
01:10:41,042 --> 01:10:43,000
'Cause I forgot to finish it!

905
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:57,917
No, don't worry about it.
This is his normal behaviour.

906
01:11:00,375 --> 01:11:01,375
Sir.

907
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:04,250
Sir, please tell me.

908
01:11:09,917 --> 01:11:12,083
My dad murdered my mom.

909
01:11:17,042 --> 01:11:18,333
I'm just joking.

910
01:11:18,542 --> 01:11:20,250
Mom and Dad are both
alive and kicking.

911
01:11:23,042 --> 01:11:24,458
Can you stop this!

912
01:11:25,333 --> 01:11:27,875
We've come from India
only to meet you.

913
01:11:28,625 --> 01:11:31,875
Can you talk normally
for just two minutes?

914
01:11:35,083 --> 01:11:36,083
Normally.

915
01:11:37,458 --> 01:11:40,417
Sir, why is your song incomplete?

916
01:11:41,292 --> 01:11:44,542
Did the reason
to complete the song end?

917
01:11:46,250 --> 01:11:48,583
Who did you write the song for?

918
01:11:48,833 --> 01:11:51,625
You surely loved her...

919
01:11:51,875 --> 01:11:53,167
Do you still do?

920
01:11:53,333 --> 01:11:57,292
Can you live happily after
the person you loved has gone?

921
01:11:57,833 --> 01:11:59,875
Do you know what happens
after death?

922
01:12:00,625 --> 01:12:01,625
No... what?

923
01:12:03,208 --> 01:12:05,458
How would I know?
I'm still alive.

924
01:12:08,708 --> 01:12:12,042
But, after my death I'll come as a ghost
and let you know.

925
01:12:12,125 --> 01:12:13,875
Can you please shut up!

926
01:12:14,125 --> 01:12:17,375
Enough of this nonsense.
Please stop this charade.

927
01:12:17,833 --> 01:12:19,434
You guys emailed us
which is why we've come.

928
01:12:19,458 --> 01:12:20,458
Kizie, let's go.

929
01:12:20,542 --> 01:12:23,167
He needs help.
He needs medical treatment.

930
01:12:23,375 --> 01:12:25,292
No doctor was able to help.

931
01:12:25,375 --> 01:12:26,375
Yeah, sure.

932
01:12:27,042 --> 01:12:30,583
When someone you love dies,
so does your own will to live.

933
01:12:32,333 --> 01:12:34,125
But, death still doesn't take you.

934
01:12:37,417 --> 01:12:39,750
And it is illegal to die by suicide.

935
01:12:41,417 --> 01:12:43,333
So, you must continue
this sorry existence.

936
01:12:44,208 --> 01:12:46,708
And because we make
stupid promises to each other

937
01:12:46,792 --> 01:12:48,893
that the one left behind
will go through life with a smile...

938
01:12:48,917 --> 01:12:49,917
Smile.

939
01:12:51,667 --> 01:12:52,708
Smile!

940
01:12:53,208 --> 01:12:54,708
Why aren't you smiling?

941
01:12:55,375 --> 01:12:58,167
If you can't even smile now
what about after death?

942
01:12:58,542 --> 01:13:00,917
That's what's going to happen
with you two, as well.

943
01:13:01,333 --> 01:13:02,583
One of you will die.

944
01:13:02,750 --> 01:13:04,750
And the other, will smile and exist.

945
01:13:06,458 --> 01:13:07,917
Smile!

946
01:13:11,208 --> 01:13:15,125
Why didn't I complete the song?
Because life is incomplete.

947
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:20,167
What's wrong?

948
01:13:22,042 --> 01:13:23,667
He was saying the truth.

949
01:13:24,583 --> 01:13:26,542
- That psycho?
- Yes.

950
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:30,125
He was saying the truth.

951
01:13:30,958 --> 01:13:35,083
People can never be happy
after losing a loved one.

952
01:13:36,917 --> 01:13:39,000
They lose their reason to smile.

953
01:13:39,375 --> 01:13:42,250
How will Ma and Dad live?
How will you?

954
01:13:43,125 --> 01:13:44,917
I'll be happy.

955
01:13:46,167 --> 01:13:47,583
I'll get rid of you, after all.

956
01:13:48,333 --> 01:13:49,333
Shut up.

957
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:50,792
Sorry.

958
01:13:50,958 --> 01:13:55,333
Life is incomplete like his song.

959
01:13:55,417 --> 01:13:57,875
I'll finish that song for you.

960
01:13:58,292 --> 01:14:00,333
And 10 times better, okay?

961
01:14:00,708 --> 01:14:03,250
I can sing it for you even now.
Just give me a second.

962
01:14:03,375 --> 01:14:06,375
- Just... sorry...
- It's not that...

963
01:14:06,542 --> 01:14:08,042
It's not funny.

964
01:14:08,208 --> 01:14:09,708
Can I please just talk to you.

965
01:14:12,292 --> 01:14:13,292
It's not funny.

966
01:14:13,333 --> 01:14:14,542
Look, you're smiling.

967
01:14:15,375 --> 01:14:16,625
I know, but...

968
01:14:17,125 --> 01:14:20,208
You were better off in Jamshedpur.

969
01:17:50,542 --> 01:17:51,833
Then?

970
01:17:53,708 --> 01:17:54,708
Then?

971
01:17:54,917 --> 01:17:55,917
Then?

972
01:17:56,958 --> 01:18:00,833
Then we went to Montmartre.

973
01:18:01,958 --> 01:18:03,292
It was beautiful.

974
01:18:03,542 --> 01:18:04,583
Very nice.

975
01:18:05,917 --> 01:18:08,375
After that... to Notre Dame.

976
01:18:09,458 --> 01:18:10,958
That was also...

977
01:18:12,792 --> 01:18:14,250
And then, Manny?

978
01:18:16,167 --> 01:18:17,833
- What?
- Notre Dame...

979
01:18:18,375 --> 01:18:19,583
That's it.

980
01:18:19,750 --> 01:18:21,417
Yes... that's it.

981
01:18:22,083 --> 01:18:23,500
- That's it?
- Yes...

982
01:18:23,750 --> 01:18:27,417
Yes... we were wandering the streets.

983
01:18:27,542 --> 01:18:28,542
Long walk.

984
01:18:28,583 --> 01:18:30,833
It was a nice long walk.

985
01:18:32,417 --> 01:18:33,833
Finish your breakfast.

986
01:18:35,333 --> 01:18:36,625
Long walk!

987
01:18:45,458 --> 01:18:47,292
Immanuel Rajkumar Junior.

988
01:18:47,375 --> 01:18:50,042
Just as Pushpinder is imperative
for my lungs,

989
01:18:51,583 --> 01:18:54,792
you are for my heart.

990
01:18:56,042 --> 01:19:00,542
It beats faster
every time you come closer.

991
01:19:02,292 --> 01:19:03,583
I love you.

992
01:19:06,833 --> 01:19:10,750
I love you, Immanuel Rajkumar Junior.

993
01:19:12,292 --> 01:19:14,667
I love you so much.

994
01:19:18,250 --> 01:19:19,250
Manny?

995
01:19:21,792 --> 01:19:22,792
Manny?

996
01:19:25,583 --> 01:19:27,042
What happened?

997
01:19:28,875 --> 01:19:29,875
Tell me.

998
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
Before you went to the hospital.

999
01:19:34,125 --> 01:19:35,458
I just had...

1000
01:19:38,292 --> 01:19:39,292
an ache.

1001
01:19:42,083 --> 01:19:44,083
I did a PET scan.

1002
01:19:45,042 --> 01:19:48,083
And it lit like a Christmas tree.

1003
01:19:56,083 --> 01:19:57,792
Can we just pretend...

1004
01:19:58,542 --> 01:20:00,917
I'm not dying.
I'm not going anywhere.

1005
01:20:00,958 --> 01:20:03,750
- Can we just pretend?
- Yeah. Yes.

1006
01:20:06,333 --> 01:20:08,708
- We'll live like this, right?
- Always.

1007
01:20:10,333 --> 01:20:11,833
Always.

1008
01:20:13,708 --> 01:20:14,792
Seri.

1009
01:20:14,875 --> 01:20:15,875
Seri.

1010
01:21:47,042 --> 01:21:49,000
I heard that...

1011
01:21:50,333 --> 01:21:52,042
you've shot the song very well.

1012
01:21:54,250 --> 01:21:57,667
- It's full of romance and sex.
- Shut up.

1013
01:21:57,875 --> 01:21:59,333
We aren't making a porn film.

1014
01:21:59,417 --> 01:22:02,250
Do I care, Manny?

1015
01:22:02,375 --> 01:22:04,000
It's not as though I can see it.

1016
01:22:07,583 --> 01:22:09,417
- But, Manny...
- Yes.

1017
01:22:10,542 --> 01:22:13,333
I really miss watching porn.

1018
01:22:13,667 --> 01:22:15,167
I'm sure.

1019
01:22:22,417 --> 01:22:24,375
And will you miss me?

1020
01:22:26,875 --> 01:22:27,875
Manny...

1021
01:22:29,625 --> 01:22:31,583
why are you saying that?

1022
01:22:31,792 --> 01:22:35,125
Of course.
I'm going to miss you loads.

1023
01:22:43,375 --> 01:22:46,792
Slowly and steadily
Manny's health was deteriorating.

1024
01:22:47,917 --> 01:22:51,917
We neither had anything to say
to each other, nor to hear.

1025
01:22:55,667 --> 01:22:57,500
And I was helpless.

1026
01:23:03,917 --> 01:23:07,333
Manny... Manny, get up.

1027
01:23:07,833 --> 01:23:09,250
- Kizie?
- Get up.

1028
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:11,000
Get up.

1029
01:23:11,750 --> 01:23:12,583
What happened?

1030
01:23:12,667 --> 01:23:14,958
- You're a phony.
- What?

1031
01:23:15,125 --> 01:23:17,708
You promised to make me a heroine.

1032
01:23:18,292 --> 01:23:20,250
- Did you forget?
- No.

1033
01:23:20,875 --> 01:23:23,250
Who will complete JP's film?

1034
01:23:24,167 --> 01:23:25,375
I will, of course.

1035
01:23:25,542 --> 01:23:26,625
So?

1036
01:23:27,833 --> 01:23:28,917
Now?

1037
01:23:29,208 --> 01:23:31,667
Seize the day, Immanuel.

1038
01:23:33,708 --> 01:23:35,917
It's now or never.

1039
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,458
The heroine must compromise.

1040
01:23:40,417 --> 01:23:41,500
Okay.

1041
01:23:43,167 --> 01:23:44,250
I'm ready.

1042
01:25:15,875 --> 01:25:17,542
Can you come to Payal theatre?

1043
01:25:18,458 --> 01:25:19,542
Why?

1044
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:22,000
What happened?

1045
01:25:22,083 --> 01:25:23,250
I need help.

1046
01:25:46,333 --> 01:25:47,333
Manny!

1047
01:25:48,083 --> 01:25:49,083
Manny!

1048
01:25:49,750 --> 01:25:51,958
Manny, what are you doing here?

1049
01:25:52,750 --> 01:25:53,750
Manny!

1050
01:25:54,583 --> 01:25:55,625
Why?

1051
01:25:59,125 --> 01:26:00,875
Manny, it's infected.

1052
01:26:01,167 --> 01:26:03,059
- I'll have to call someone.
- No, please. Kizie, no!

1053
01:26:03,083 --> 01:26:04,958
Don't call them.
Please don't call them.

1054
01:26:05,458 --> 01:26:07,583
- Manny!
- Don't call my dad.

1055
01:26:07,667 --> 01:26:09,958
- I'll never talk to you.
- I'll have to call your dad.

1056
01:26:10,250 --> 01:26:12,542
Manny, what are you doing here?

1057
01:26:12,625 --> 01:26:15,917
I just... wanted to do
something for myself.

1058
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,042
Wanted to do it on my own.

1059
01:26:19,208 --> 01:26:20,208
I'm...

1060
01:26:20,792 --> 01:26:24,375
Could you help me?
Could you please help me?

1061
01:26:24,458 --> 01:26:27,125
- I have to call the ambulance.
- I don't want to die.

1062
01:26:30,208 --> 01:26:32,500
Hello, Tata Hospital?

1063
01:26:32,750 --> 01:26:34,875
Please can you come
to Payal Cinema?

1064
01:26:34,958 --> 01:26:37,417
Ramkrishna colony, Jamshedpur.

1065
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:49,958
The one who taught me to smile

1066
01:26:50,500 --> 01:26:54,208
was howling in pain.
He was screaming.

1067
01:27:00,500 --> 01:27:02,708
And I couldn't do anything.

1068
01:27:22,958 --> 01:27:24,333
Hi, Manny.

1069
01:27:26,750 --> 01:27:28,125
Please go.

1070
01:27:29,708 --> 01:27:30,917
I'm fine.

1071
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:35,500
Really?

1072
01:27:35,833 --> 01:27:38,042
I don't need you right now.

1073
01:27:38,250 --> 01:27:40,292
My name means a latch.

1074
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:48,625
You won't leave me?

1075
01:27:49,917 --> 01:27:51,500
Not until the very end.

1076
01:27:57,042 --> 01:27:59,083
Manny had come home.

1077
01:27:59,958 --> 01:28:03,958
But, how long he would survive,
was a looming question.

1078
01:28:09,958 --> 01:28:11,333
Mr Rajkumar.

1079
01:28:11,917 --> 01:28:13,042
Ms Basu.

1080
01:28:13,500 --> 01:28:18,000
I told you that when I die,
you would have to give my eulogy.

1081
01:28:18,375 --> 01:28:19,708
Have you written anything?

1082
01:28:21,375 --> 01:28:22,375
Yes.

1083
01:28:22,583 --> 01:28:23,833
Then hurry to the church.

1084
01:28:23,917 --> 01:28:26,042
Manny, are you okay?

1085
01:28:26,458 --> 01:28:28,000
I love you, Kizie Basu.

1086
01:28:39,750 --> 01:28:45,542
Five more steps. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

1087
01:28:45,625 --> 01:28:46,625
Right turn.

1088
01:28:48,792 --> 01:28:49,792
Straight.

1089
01:28:52,083 --> 01:28:54,208
You're there. Almost.

1090
01:29:01,792 --> 01:29:02,792
You're late.

1091
01:29:03,167 --> 01:29:04,250
Welcome.

1092
01:29:06,292 --> 01:29:07,292
What's happening?

1093
01:29:08,292 --> 01:29:10,417
Tell her, bro...
What's happening?

1094
01:29:14,583 --> 01:29:17,042
I wanted to attend my own funeral.

1095
01:29:17,708 --> 01:29:20,875
Though I know I'm going to be
somewhere here as a ghost.

1096
01:29:21,917 --> 01:29:23,875
In case it doesn't work out.

1097
01:29:24,042 --> 01:29:26,625
- So... preview.
- Okay.

1098
01:29:26,917 --> 01:29:28,333
- JP.
- Yes.

1099
01:29:31,625 --> 01:29:33,792
I haven't prepared anything.

1100
01:29:34,292 --> 01:29:38,375
When Manny was 24...

1101
01:29:38,875 --> 01:29:39,958
I'm 23.

1102
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,833
You're dead, Manny.
Why're you butting in?

1103
01:29:44,458 --> 01:29:47,000
Won't you live another year,
at least?

1104
01:29:47,792 --> 01:29:51,875
I met Manny when he was 19.

1105
01:29:52,292 --> 01:29:54,542
He had a killer smile, even then.

1106
01:29:54,875 --> 01:29:58,042
And when I met him, I was charmed.

1107
01:29:58,750 --> 01:30:01,708
I found out much later
what a jerk he really was.

1108
01:30:04,958 --> 01:30:07,792
My family is in Bihar.

1109
01:30:08,708 --> 01:30:13,417
Manny and his grandma
were my only family here.

1110
01:30:14,458 --> 01:30:19,583
They became closer to me
than my real family.

1111
01:30:26,958 --> 01:30:29,167
I sometimes feel...

1112
01:30:31,208 --> 01:30:33,333
it's best that I lost my sight.

1113
01:30:36,750 --> 01:30:40,333
Because I don't want to see a world
that doesn't have Manny.

1114
01:30:42,167 --> 01:30:46,375
I've lost my sight but I will always
remember Manny's face.

1115
01:30:47,583 --> 01:30:49,292
My best friend.

1116
01:30:50,208 --> 01:30:53,833
Immanuel Rajkumar Junior.

1117
01:30:56,833 --> 01:30:59,333
Whoa, that's too much emotion.

1118
01:31:00,458 --> 01:31:02,500
So... okay, bye.

1119
01:31:02,833 --> 01:31:04,000
Take care.

1120
01:31:08,375 --> 01:31:09,708
Kizie Basu.

1121
01:31:22,208 --> 01:31:26,000
When I moved from Zambia
to Jamshedpur, I was angry.

1122
01:31:26,917 --> 01:31:27,958
And scared.

1123
01:31:29,750 --> 01:31:33,750
I was angry because I thought, "Why me?"

1124
01:31:35,083 --> 01:31:38,375
Why did I need Pushpinder
so early in life?

1125
01:31:39,083 --> 01:31:41,042
And I was scared wondering...

1126
01:31:41,167 --> 01:31:43,458
what would become
of Ma and Dad after I die?

1127
01:31:43,833 --> 01:31:50,750
But suddenly one day,
came Manny, dancing into my life.

1128
01:31:52,125 --> 01:31:55,917
I haven't ever met anyone
more irritating than him.

1129
01:32:00,833 --> 01:32:02,333
Neither do I want to.

1130
01:32:12,667 --> 01:32:16,792
He made jest of everything.
Laughed at everything.

1131
01:32:17,750 --> 01:32:20,542
And taught me how to live life.

1132
01:32:21,042 --> 01:32:25,042
And slowly, he became my reason to live.

1133
01:32:27,917 --> 01:32:29,708
But, just as...

1134
01:32:30,583 --> 01:32:33,792
quickly he came into my life...
he also exited.

1135
01:32:34,958 --> 01:32:37,792
And left me all alone... again.

1136
01:32:40,500 --> 01:32:44,417
Left me all alone... again.

1137
01:32:56,333 --> 01:33:00,083
And two days later,
Manny left us.

1138
01:33:03,292 --> 01:33:05,667
He left me a letter.

1139
01:33:07,708 --> 01:33:10,208
Kizie, once upon a time
there were a Prince and a Princess.

1140
01:33:10,292 --> 01:33:12,000
They died. The End.

1141
01:33:12,583 --> 01:33:14,250
Every grandmother tells this story.

1142
01:33:15,333 --> 01:33:16,750
But, it's an incomplete one.

1143
01:33:17,375 --> 01:33:19,708
One that the Prince and Princess complete.

1144
01:33:21,042 --> 01:33:24,667
We don't get to decide
when we're born or when we die.

1145
01:33:25,333 --> 01:33:28,458
But we do get to decide
how we live our lives.

1146
01:33:29,833 --> 01:33:32,458
So, Kizie Basu, this Prince is dead.

1147
01:33:32,875 --> 01:33:35,125
But, his Princess lives.

1148
01:33:35,208 --> 01:33:38,500
And until then, our story lives on.

1149
01:34:47,083 --> 01:34:52,875
Kizie, I promised to complete
your favourite song.

1150
01:34:54,833 --> 01:34:58,292
I had to ask that madman,
Abhimanyu Veer, for help.

1151
01:34:58,750 --> 01:35:02,625
I'm a true lover, but a poor poet.

1152
01:35:03,417 --> 01:35:08,375
And he's a terrible human being,
but a talented musician.

1153
01:36:37,458 --> 01:36:38,458
Seri, Kizie Basu?

1154
01:36:41,708 --> 01:36:42,708
Seri!

1155
01:36:42,732 --> 01:36:45,732
