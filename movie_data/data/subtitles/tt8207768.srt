1
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:30,208
How's your man?

2
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:31,958
Same as yours.

3
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,625
Motherfuckers! All are the same!

4
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:41,666
Not at all. Some are sweet and sappy,
some are bastards like yours.

5
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:46,458
Some sulk, some try to sweet talk

6
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:49,041
some use fists, some beg.

7
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:51,458
And then...

8
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:52,541
And then?

9
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:53,750
The usual...

10
00:02:56,791 --> 00:03:00,666
Only one thing keeps men in check.

11
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:02,708
- You are right...
- What?

12
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:04,291
The usual...

13
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:06,291
Granny's experience talking!

14
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:10,916
What asshole is out so late?

15
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,375
Won't let us even shit in peace.
They wanna peep between our legs.

16
00:03:14,916 --> 00:03:16,291
Spoilt my mood.

17
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,833
...MY DEAR PRIME MINISTER

18
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:22,166
<i>After midnight, out in the open</i>

19
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:24,625
<i>By highways, have to go</i>

20
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,291
<i>Our mother and sister</i>

21
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:25,125
<i>My hubby teases me His sister mocks me</i>

22
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:28,000
<i>Life at my in-laws' place</i>

23
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:32,416
<i>The mother-in-law scolds
While the brother-in-law appeases</i>

24
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:35,416
<i>Life at my in-laws' place</i>

25
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:40,875
<i>I left my parents' place
To be with my hubby</i>

26
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:46,125
- Who is it?
- It's me, Pappu.

27
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,791
I'm bathing.

28
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:50,041
Please take your time, Sargam ji.

29
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,375
- I've come for Kannu...
- He...

30
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:57,208
Kannu...

31
00:04:57,583 --> 00:05:00,250
Get up. Pappu's here.

32
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:03,041
<i>He chews a betel leaf</i>

33
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:08,750
<i>There's none like him in Raipur</i>

34
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:11,125
<i>Life at my...</i>

35
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:17,541
Is Kannu ready?

36
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:21,333
- He won't wake up.
- Me too... As a child...

37
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:27,666
It's okay.

38
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,833
Send him when he is up.

39
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:34,625
Good morning, Mr. Pappu.

40
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:38,500
Good morning, Rabiya ma'am.

41
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:41,291
See you...

42
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:42,291
Okay.

43
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:43,416
Okay.

44
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:48,750
What a nice boy.

45
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:53,041
- Marry him then.
- Sadly, he loves you.

46
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:55,000
He came for Kannu.

47
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:57,375
And left his heart behind!

48
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:58,625
Ms. Rabiya.

49
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:02,125
- This time for love...
- What happened?

50
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:06,833
- I can't sacrifice water!
- Damn!

51
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:08,041
Crazy girl.

52
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:10,833
Go. I will send my He-Man.

53
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:15,250
My He-Man Sajju. Get up...

54
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,500
Water will run out.

55
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:20,250
There isn't any to wash your ass.

56
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:23,125
- I don't need to go now.
- What rubbish? Go now!

57
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:24,583
Come on, hurry up.

58
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:28,708
Stop nagging early in
the morning, you crazy woman!

59
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:38,208
Go. Get water.

60
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,375
You're so sexy when you're pissed.

61
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,250
Hurry up. Go fill water.

62
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:20,916
Ma... Water.

63
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:25,750
Fifteen minutes to go! Fill it up fast.

64
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:29,958
- Diksha, my bucket's filled?
- Is it done?

65
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:30,875
Done.

66
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,416
Granny, be careful.

67
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:35,541
- We do it...
- Take your time.

68
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,333
Make it fast.

69
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,750
Granny!

70
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:45,041
What, Adgale?

71
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:48,666
Stealing at your age!
What will you tell your Maker?

72
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:52,750
"Sorry God, I have sinned.
I ripped off a dirty thief."

73
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:54,458
Very funny!

74
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:58,250
Free for you.

75
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:03,083
Free for senior citizens...

76
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:07,458
I can take care of you.

77
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:13,416
- Should I drop your buckets home?
- Lay off!

78
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:15,958
Look at Granny.

79
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:20,208
Try helping her.

80
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:26,791
- Granny!
- Yes, dear. Let's go...

81
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:28,625
- Come on...
- Slow and steady...

82
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:33,750
Long ago this river was clean.

83
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:37,291
Fishermen would come to fish here.

84
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,458
You kidding, Ringtone?

85
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:41,666
I know stories from
before you were born...

86
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:44,083
that would make you piss your pants.

87
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:46,625
Impossible!

88
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:55,250
Granny says they were big
boats with big fish... Pomfret!

89
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:56,250
Boats?

90
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:57,875
Fish boat!

91
00:08:57,958 --> 00:08:59,791
Bullshit!

92
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:02,041
Ringtone doesn't mess around.

93
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:05,291
- You wanna bet?
- What?

94
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:10,125
Fish boats came this way or not.

95
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:13,833
- We don't do dumb bets.
- What kind then?

96
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:14,958
Jump off from here.

97
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:17,916
Now that's a bet! Jump, Nirala.

98
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:24,291
Looks like Nirala's wet his pants!

99
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:27,166
Scared as shit?

100
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,125
Stop kissing his ass and jump instead.

101
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:30,625
Kannu doesn't either.

102
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:33,958
Even for 50 bucks extra?

103
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:36,916
First the dough.

104
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:40,833
Here... Now jump.

105
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:42,166
Start counting.

106
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,000
- Jump now.
- Count.

107
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:50,291
One... Two...

108
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:52,875
Thanks for the 50 bucks, bro!

109
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:55,333
Wash your shitty butts at least.

110
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:58,916
Wash them...

111
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:03,541
<i>What's my name...</i>

112
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:07,666
<i>My name is Sheela
And this is my youth</i>

113
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:13,000
<i>I'm too sexy for you
You will never get me</i>

114
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:17,500
<i>Sheela...
And this is my youth</i>

115
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:19,916
Sit down.

116
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,833
<i>You will never get me</i>

117
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:24,666
Hey!

118
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:30,083
Ringtone... I said 4 in a packet.

119
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:34,958
Careful or I'll tell your Pop
you sell drugs.

120
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:37,458
I don't have one.

121
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:40,875
Then find one, with your ringtone.

122
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:44,666
Sainath...

123
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:46,750
Why's this called Bombay Black?

124
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:49,291
Coz it's black.

125
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:50,875
And where does it sell?

126
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:53,416
In Bombay! That's it.

127
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,666
Hence Mumbai Black.

128
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:55,875
Father.

129
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:58,250
I've told you not to come here!

130
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:00,041
Eva Madam is here. Come soon.

131
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:06,583
Get out.

132
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,333
Jeez! I'm outta here.

133
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:16,791
Selling any tickets?

134
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,500
Sexy Sheila is on now.

135
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:25,041
Eva madam...

136
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:32,291
Put Mangla in an English school.

137
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:34,666
She will nab a good husband then.

138
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:38,333
She will nab a good job.

139
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:41,333
She's like your daughter.

140
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,083
Whatever you say, Madam.

141
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,166
Take care of her. You are her father.

142
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,333
Sure?

143
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
See her off.

144
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:57,333
You are here!

145
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:01,500
Hey you... Out... Out.

146
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,125
Please give me a lift.

147
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:05,166
I'm late for work, Pappu will yell...

148
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,291
then I'll be late for school

149
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:09,583
and there Mangla will yell.

150
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:12,125
Come on. Back seat.

151
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:14,875
What happened?

152
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,833
You go to school every day?

153
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:26,083
Sometimes... If there
is too much work, I bunk.

154
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:30,500
I can do English reading
but not English talking.

155
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:35,583
Take this. One rupee for one condom.

156
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:41,416
I don't have that much.

157
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:44,500
I will give you one rupee

158
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:47,166
for every condom you give away.

159
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:49,833
Okay. Send me more.

160
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:53,666
I have a lot of friends.
I'll distribute them.

161
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:56,458
It's only for adults.

162
00:12:57,291 --> 00:12:58,666
Why so?

163
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:01,208
Mangla will explain.

164
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:38,291
Do you know what time it is?
What's the time now?

165
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:40,833
Late again!

166
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:44,250
Is this how you will become a big man?

167
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:47,000
Look at me!

168
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,750
I didn't get this far messing around.

169
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:53,291
It's hard work!

170
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,250
I was helping Mom make lunch.

171
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:57,916
Liar!

172
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:01,333
Sargam is never late.

173
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:04,625
Mom sent lunch for you.

174
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:09,125
- For me?
- Just for you.

175
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:11,208
- Really?
- Yes...

176
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:12,958
Let me see.

177
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:15,583
You don't know.

178
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:30,791
CEO... Rape...

179
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:34,291
What's this? Secretary...

180
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,208
What is CEO?

181
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:39,666
Big boss.

182
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:40,833
And rape?

183
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:45,458
Do I pay you to discuss the news?

184
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:47,291
Go sell now.

185
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:54,083
Here...

186
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:57,458
Condom. For adults. Use it.

187
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,583
I don't do such things.

188
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:01,333
What does a condom do?

189
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:02,458
Move along, kid...

190
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:05,166
- Sell the papers.
- Hold this first...

191
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:07,958
Use it, okay?

192
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,000
<i>God gives all He can</i>

193
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:17,791
<i>Man gives nothing for free</i>

194
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:28,500
<i>Ah! Loose change...</i>

195
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:32,333
<i>Ah! Loose change...</i>

196
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,541
<i>Loose change...</i>

197
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:43,750
<i>The truth, plain and simple</i>

198
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:46,791
<i>We are the people of the footpath</i>

199
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:49,083
<i>Have no caste or creed</i>

200
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:54,708
<i>Digging wells every day Filling our pails</i>

201
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:59,166
<i>It's a play
Living life the same way</i>

202
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,958
<i>Loose change...</i>

203
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:12,750
Gimme the dough.

204
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:13,791
Take it later, no?

205
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:15,833
Here. Two condoms free.

206
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:19,000
Free? Sainath's got a factory back there?

207
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:21,041
Use them...

208
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:24,000
and I guarantee you will be back for more.

209
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:26,041
Okay.

210
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:27,416
<i>Money is all...</i>

211
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,541
What about the film?

212
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:31,208
<i>Jobs...</i>

213
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:32,791
Now go get to work.

214
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:36,500
<i>Loose change...</i>

215
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:48,000
<i>Naked-urchins - aces all</i>

216
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:54,291
<i>From pockets like loose coins fall</i>

217
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:57,583
<i>Our skulls fused, our slums glued</i>

218
00:16:57,666 --> 00:17:00,708
<i>Only one God rules this lane</i>

219
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:06,208
<i>Let it all jingle-jangle...
Loose change</i>

220
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:09,375
<i>Loose change...</i>

221
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:14,958
<i>Loose change...</i>

222
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:20,750
<i>God gives all He can</i>

223
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,541
<i>Man gives nothing for free</i>

224
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,875
Ma... Here.

225
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:28,833
- What?
- Take this.

226
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:39,583
- Who gave you these?
- Eva Madam. Said to hand them around.

227
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:43,166
It's not candy to pass around.

228
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:48,250
Do you even know what it is?

229
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,083
Condom.

230
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:57,500
Ma... What does a condom do?

231
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:06,208
- This...
- Ma!

232
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:07,125
What?

233
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:08,583
Mom, what does it do?

234
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:18,083
You've seen our tea strainer?

235
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:19,958
Condom is a strainer

236
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:24,166
- that strains out babies.
- Is it?

237
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:28,041
How? Let me see.

238
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:29,166
Kannu!

239
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,958
Come home when
you hear the whistle of the cooker.

240
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:41,375
Listen up.

241
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:44,041
Do you know what a condom does?

242
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:45,041
Nope.

243
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,750
- You know the tea strainer, right?
- Yes.

244
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:50,666
Condom is the tea strainer

245
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:53,208
that strains out babies.

246
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:54,625
Hang on.

247
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:56,250
How do you know?

248
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,916
I know everything.

249
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:00,875
Let's make our voices reach the moon.

250
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:25,083
C'mon, Kannu. It's late.

251
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:28,625
- Drink your milk.
- I don't wanna.

252
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:29,958
Why not?

253
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:33,416
- I don't like milk.
- Why don't you?

254
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:39,625
You promised to if
I let you play for half an hour.

255
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:41,458
- In a bit...
- No...

256
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:42,791
- It's done...
- No.

257
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:45,291
C'mon, Kannu...

258
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:46,625
Stop!

259
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:48,083
Don't make me run after you!

260
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:50,375
Kannu, listen to me. Kannu!

261
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:53,000
I'm tired of this daily ruckus.
Why do you do this?

262
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:56,708
We had a deal.

263
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:59,541
- I don't want milk.
- If you didn't want to...

264
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:01,250
You promised.

265
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,916
Kannu! I'll delete everything!

266
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,208
- You don't know my password.
- I'll ask Mangla.

267
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:10,375
She doesn't know it...

268
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:12,416
Kannu, why do you trouble me?

269
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:16,208
Don't drink it. Shut the light yourself.

270
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:20,333
And don't talk to me. Liar!

271
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:27,875
Always troubling me.

272
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,375
<i>Hey, I got a plan</i>

273
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:41,875
<i>And what's the plan?</i>

274
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:43,541
<i>Listen</i>

275
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:44,708
<i>I'm all ears</i>

276
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:46,833
<i>Wanna come to Khandala?</i>

277
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:51,791
<i>What's happening in Khandala?</i>

278
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:56,916
<i>We'll sing, dance, have fun...
So game?</i>

279
00:20:57,708 --> 00:21:02,000
<i>Hey, I got a plan</i>

280
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:07,000
<i>And what's the plan?</i>

281
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,375
<i>Listen</i>

282
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:09,750
<i>I'm all ears</i>

283
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:11,875
<i>Wanna come to Khandala?</i>

284
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:16,916
<i>What's happening in Khandala?</i>

285
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:21,583
<i>We'll sing, dance, have fun...
So game?</i>

286
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:26,875
<i>Hey, I got a plan</i>

287
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:32,708
<i>And what's the plan?</i>

288
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:34,250
Give that to me.

289
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:42,958
Presenting...

290
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:50,916
Hey...

291
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,291
- Finished your milk?
- Yes.

292
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:10,333
My darling.

293
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:11,625
Now go to sleep.

294
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,833
Hey you, Slumdog! Get out!

295
00:22:29,916 --> 00:22:31,416
I have to meet Eva Madam.

296
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:32,750
Really?

297
00:22:32,833 --> 00:22:36,708
-Scram
-We have a meeting. Ask her.

298
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:44,333
- A kid's here to meet you.
- Kannu.

299
00:22:45,375 --> 00:22:46,333
Name is Kannu.

300
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,416
Yes, madam.

301
00:22:50,625 --> 00:22:52,708
You done? May I go now?

302
00:22:53,416 --> 00:22:55,375
A wing, 11th floor, apartment number 1101.

303
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:57,958
What's your problem?
It's your house or what?

304
00:22:59,041 --> 00:22:59,958
Just go now.

305
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:09,500
Here's a condom. For adults.

306
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:10,833
Use it.

307
00:23:13,375 --> 00:23:15,916
Less kids, less tension.

308
00:23:16,958 --> 00:23:17,833
It's 904.

309
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:23,083
What do you want?

310
00:23:24,791 --> 00:23:26,666
-Call Eva madam
-Why?

311
00:23:27,666 --> 00:23:29,208
Tell her Kannu's here.

312
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,666
Listen.

313
00:23:32,166 --> 00:23:33,666
Here. A condom.

314
00:23:34,583 --> 00:23:36,833
You're an adult. Use it.

315
00:23:43,666 --> 00:23:44,958
It's 905.

316
00:23:53,708 --> 00:23:55,791
- How are you?
- Good.

317
00:23:56,458 --> 00:23:57,291
It's 905.

318
00:24:02,166 --> 00:24:03,291
Oh! Really?

319
00:24:06,291 --> 00:24:08,416
One rupee for one condom.

320
00:24:10,958 --> 00:24:12,583
Here's 2000 rupees.

321
00:24:12,958 --> 00:24:14,208
I don't have change.

322
00:24:14,291 --> 00:24:16,708
Rest is Holi festival donation.

323
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,541
I need to use the toilet real bad.

324
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:24,333
Of course. That way.

325
00:26:17,708 --> 00:26:18,666
Know what they do?

326
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:20,416
- What?
- Tell me.

327
00:26:21,333 --> 00:26:23,625
They don't wash. They wipe.

328
00:26:23,708 --> 00:26:27,000
- Who?
- People living in tall buildings.

329
00:26:27,083 --> 00:26:30,958
- They...
- They have spacious toilets.

330
00:26:31,833 --> 00:26:33,458
They wipe it with a thin paper.

331
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:35,083
Paper?

332
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:38,416
How thin is it?

333
00:26:39,291 --> 00:26:41,958
- Later...
- Show it to me...

334
00:26:44,166 --> 00:26:45,166
Give it to me.

335
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:46,958
Leave it.

336
00:26:58,583 --> 00:27:01,916
- Have this...
- No. I won't.

337
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,666
Have it...

338
00:27:04,625 --> 00:27:05,750
I can't.

339
00:27:10,625 --> 00:27:12,541
Happy Holi!

340
00:27:26,916 --> 00:27:29,416
- No.
- Come on... Have it.

341
00:28:50,458 --> 00:28:54,833
<i>The drums rend the sky</i>

342
00:28:54,916 --> 00:28:59,208
<i>And marijuana cocktail makes
The rounds</i>

343
00:28:59,291 --> 00:29:03,500
<i>I fly high on drinking marijuana</i>

344
00:29:03,583 --> 00:29:07,333
<i>And the drumroll sounds</i>

345
00:29:07,416 --> 00:29:11,125
<i>Let go of my veil, hey, naughty you</i>

346
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:15,083
<i>Else I will abuse black and blue</i>

347
00:29:15,166 --> 00:29:19,750
<i>I'm not simple and naive, mind you</i>

348
00:29:23,958 --> 00:29:28,041
<i>Sweet is the sound of abuse from you</i>

349
00:29:28,125 --> 00:29:32,750
<i>The goat laughs The baby and the cock too</i>

350
00:29:32,875 --> 00:29:36,875
<i>I fly high on drinking marijuana</i>

351
00:29:36,958 --> 00:29:40,791
<i>And the drumroll sounds</i>

352
00:29:40,875 --> 00:29:44,791
<i>Let go of my veil, hey, naughty you</i>

<i>Else I will abuse black and blue</i>

00:29:49,083 --> 00:29:53,166
<i>I'm not simple and naive, mind you</i>

355
00:29:57,708 --> 00:29:59,708
<i>The blue sky blushed</i>

356
00:29:59,791 --> 00:30:02,000
<i>Looking into your blue eyes</i>

357
00:30:02,125 --> 00:30:05,833
<i>Have turned Pappu pale</i>

358
00:30:05,916 --> 00:30:08,125
<i>The guy all wet</i>

359
00:30:08,208 --> 00:30:10,125
<i>A little crazy in the head</i>

360
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:12,208
<i>The color red too, o boy</i>

361
00:30:12,291 --> 00:30:14,250
<i>Turning all pale and coy</i>

362
00:30:14,333 --> 00:30:16,291
<i>One and three and two</i>

363
00:30:16,375 --> 00:30:18,208
The girl drenched through And through

364
00:30:18,291 --> 00:30:19,625
<i>Uff! Allah</i>

365
00:30:19,708 --> 00:30:22,625
<i>Look in the mirror, Subhanllah!</i>

366
00:30:42,791 --> 00:30:47,166
<i>Blue eyed damsel</i>

367
00:30:47,458 --> 00:30:51,708
<i>Your body colored blue</i>

368
00:30:51,791 --> 00:30:53,500
<i>Fill my heart</i>

369
00:30:53,583 --> 00:30:55,500
<i>You fill my soul</i>

370
00:30:55,791 --> 00:31:00,500
<i>Blue eyed damsel</i>

371
00:31:38,166 --> 00:31:39,208
Four times!

372
00:31:39,958 --> 00:31:41,166
Four times?

373
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:44,291
Didn't let go all night.

374
00:31:44,666 --> 00:31:45,791
Keep it up.

375
00:31:47,708 --> 00:31:49,000
Look, Rabiya.

376
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:53,208
Marijuana usually makes men loosen up...

377
00:31:54,041 --> 00:31:55,666
but in bed...

378
00:31:55,833 --> 00:31:57,583
Praise The Lord!

379
00:32:00,208 --> 00:32:02,875
Granny, you danced a lot.

380
00:32:03,708 --> 00:32:05,083
Oh cut it out...

381
00:32:05,416 --> 00:32:06,958
It's done. Let's go.

382
00:32:07,208 --> 00:32:09,416
- You need to...
- Sargam.

383
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,291
You are really late today.

384
00:32:11,791 --> 00:32:13,750
My eyes just wouldn't open.

385
00:32:13,833 --> 00:32:15,416
Pappu keep you up all night?

386
00:32:18,083 --> 00:32:20,500
Nothing like that.
He went home after dancing.

387
00:32:20,625 --> 00:32:22,125
"He went home after dancing."

388
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:24,791
And how the two of you danced!

389
00:32:24,875 --> 00:32:27,041
Had eyes only for each other.

390
00:32:27,125 --> 00:32:30,208
- It was the Marijuana cocktail.
- Of course.

391
00:32:30,291 --> 00:32:32,333
Whatever. Now listen to me.

392
00:32:32,416 --> 00:32:35,083
Pappu is a sweet, innocent guy.

393
00:32:35,166 --> 00:32:37,083
Don't think so much. Just say yes.

394
00:32:37,166 --> 00:32:40,208
Yeah! So innocent,
he just danced and left.

395
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:44,416
Rabiya, you are impossible. I am going.

396
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,250
- I'll come with you.
- No... Don't worry.

397
00:32:46,333 --> 00:32:47,916
It's going to be light very soon.

398
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,333
Not you...

399
00:32:49,708 --> 00:32:51,458
It's Sajju she's worried about.

400
00:32:51,541 --> 00:32:54,083
- He will be ready for round 5!
- Really?

401
00:32:55,333 --> 00:32:56,583
Let's go.

402
00:33:26,083 --> 00:33:27,166
Leave me!

403
00:33:38,625 --> 00:33:40,791
Bastard! I'll break your nose.

404
00:33:40,875 --> 00:33:43,083
What's going on here?

405
00:33:43,166 --> 00:33:44,333
Don't let him go.

406
00:33:44,416 --> 00:33:46,916
Stop. Stop...

407
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,375
She's my friend.

408
00:33:49,291 --> 00:33:51,666
Friend means you can force her? Huh?

409
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:54,791
She broke my nose... It's bleeding.

410
00:33:54,875 --> 00:33:57,750
If I ram this up your arse,
nose may stop bleeding.

411
00:33:57,916 --> 00:34:01,916
Forgive me, sir. Let me go.

412
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,250
Don't hit me, sir.

413
00:34:05,708 --> 00:34:09,000
She's a friend, sir...

414
00:34:12,708 --> 00:34:14,750
Where are you going?

415
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,208
He's from my colony, I'll deal with him.

416
00:34:19,291 --> 00:34:20,916
No. You have to file a complaint.

417
00:34:23,333 --> 00:34:25,750
No, sir. I don't want to.

418
00:34:25,875 --> 00:34:27,333
It is compulsory.

419
00:34:27,875 --> 00:34:31,333
We'll deal with him.
I don't want to file a complaint.

420
00:34:31,833 --> 00:34:32,916
You have to.

421
00:34:33,916 --> 00:34:35,416
Sir, I don't want to.

422
00:34:35,541 --> 00:34:36,750
I said you have to.

423
00:34:39,833 --> 00:34:41,208
I don't want to, sir!

424
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,333
Mother!

425
00:36:35,166 --> 00:36:38,083
Sainath! How dare you touch her!

426
00:36:38,625 --> 00:36:40,500
What do you mean?

427
00:36:40,583 --> 00:36:43,250
Everyone was high and dancing.

428
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,166
So was she.

429
00:36:46,958 --> 00:36:49,583
I thought she was flirting...

430
00:36:49,666 --> 00:36:51,625
Shut up, you scoundrel. Bloody cur.

431
00:36:51,708 --> 00:36:53,666
We know that you are a lecher!

432
00:36:54,291 --> 00:36:56,000
I was a little drunk...

433
00:36:56,708 --> 00:36:58,666
I didn't do anything to her.

434
00:36:59,541 --> 00:37:00,666
Those guys took her.

435
00:37:01,166 --> 00:37:02,875
And you let them!

436
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:05,958
You would let someone take me too?

437
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:08,041
How dare you?

438
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:10,833
- She is my daughter...
- Try doing that again!

439
00:37:10,916 --> 00:37:13,666
- Enough, you two.
- Tell him!

440
00:37:14,458 --> 00:37:15,833
Apologize to her.

441
00:37:27,416 --> 00:37:28,833
I will take care of you...

442
00:37:30,416 --> 00:37:31,625
even marry you.

443
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:34,250
- You talk to me.
- Why should I talk to you?

444
00:37:34,333 --> 00:37:36,750
Don't you touch her!

445
00:37:36,833 --> 00:37:39,333
What has happened to you?

446
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,541
Sargam, open the door!

447
00:38:06,375 --> 00:38:07,625
Sargam, open the door!

448
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:17,291
Listen to me! Open the door!

449
00:38:22,458 --> 00:38:24,916
Look. Kannu is here... Call out to her!

450
00:38:27,208 --> 00:38:29,958
Sargam, open the door.

451
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,333
Bastards!

452
00:38:44,541 --> 00:38:46,541
They won't let us shit in peace either!

453
00:39:55,833 --> 00:39:59,083
Presenting Kannu, the joker!

454
00:40:00,666 --> 00:40:02,833
<i>Wanna come to Khandala?</i>

455
00:40:07,041 --> 00:40:12,708
<i>We'll dance, sing, have fun...
So, game?</i>

456
00:41:03,083 --> 00:41:05,333
I'm hungry.

457
00:41:06,583 --> 00:41:07,833
Go clean up.

458
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:12,416
What's for dinner?

459
00:41:14,791 --> 00:41:15,875
<i>Khichdi.</i>

460
00:41:31,916 --> 00:41:35,041
Don't worry about Sainath, okay?

461
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:45,250
I'll grow up and marry you.

462
00:41:47,791 --> 00:41:50,416
You make the world's best <i>khichdi</i>.

463
00:41:53,041 --> 00:41:54,458
You eat...

464
00:41:55,666 --> 00:41:58,208
- I am not hungry.
- Eat.

465
00:42:08,458 --> 00:42:11,166
- One more bite.
- No.

466
00:42:18,166 --> 00:42:19,666
I'll grow up real soon.

467
00:42:24,958 --> 00:42:26,708
It's me... Pappu.

468
00:42:31,291 --> 00:42:32,708
Please open the door.

469
00:42:44,541 --> 00:42:46,541
Just wanted to know how you're doing.

470
00:43:04,833 --> 00:43:06,541
Mom says she is fine.

471
00:43:10,583 --> 00:43:13,125
Take a few days off.

472
00:43:15,125 --> 00:43:16,208
Take care of her.

473
00:43:17,833 --> 00:43:18,833
Okay?

474
00:44:40,833 --> 00:44:42,416
<i>You would let someone take me too?</i>

475
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:43,666
<i>Sargam, open the door!</i>

476
00:44:44,291 --> 00:44:46,541
<i>I will take care of you... even marry you.</i>

477
00:44:46,625 --> 00:44:47,958
<i>And take care of your mother.</i>

478
00:44:48,041 --> 00:44:50,083
<i>They won't let us shit in peace either!</i>

479
00:47:05,166 --> 00:47:07,833
What are you up to?

480
00:47:09,041 --> 00:47:10,583
What are you doing?

481
00:47:10,666 --> 00:47:13,125
- Don't disturb me.
- Come on, tell me.

482
00:47:13,458 --> 00:47:14,833
Digging your grave, you idiot.

483
00:47:16,041 --> 00:47:17,458
Hey, bro, pick it up.

484
00:47:25,916 --> 00:47:27,833
Hey, hold fast!

485
00:47:28,458 --> 00:47:29,916
What is this?

486
00:47:32,708 --> 00:47:33,875
Stay still.

487
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,041
Come with me quickly!

488
00:47:38,125 --> 00:47:39,708
- What happened?
- Something happened to Kannu.

489
00:47:39,791 --> 00:47:40,875
What?

490
00:47:40,958 --> 00:47:44,625
Ringtone was saying something
and the call got disconnected.

491
00:47:44,833 --> 00:47:46,416
- Where?
- On the hilltop.

492
00:47:57,958 --> 00:47:58,958
Where is Kannu?

493
00:48:06,708 --> 00:48:08,000
Mom's here?

494
00:48:15,166 --> 00:48:17,916
It's our very own toilet, Mom...

495
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,583
You can use it anytime.

496
00:48:21,333 --> 00:48:24,083
Come.

497
00:48:25,875 --> 00:48:27,041
Come on.

498
00:48:55,041 --> 00:48:57,208
Come.

499
00:48:59,083 --> 00:49:00,583
Close your eyes.

500
00:49:08,083 --> 00:49:09,333
Now open them!

501
00:49:18,708 --> 00:49:20,250
Why is she crying?

502
00:49:20,333 --> 00:49:22,833
Because Kannu tore up
her dress to make the toilet.

503
00:49:42,916 --> 00:49:45,000
Let me check.

504
00:49:47,041 --> 00:49:48,458
Keep your feet here.

505
00:49:48,541 --> 00:49:49,583
Here?

506
00:49:50,041 --> 00:49:51,500
Be careful.

507
00:49:51,625 --> 00:49:54,375
Kannu, we'll fall...

508
00:50:45,708 --> 00:50:46,750
What happened?

509
00:50:46,833 --> 00:50:51,250
Kannu's private toilet
is now a public toilet!

510
00:50:51,333 --> 00:50:52,583
Give me that!

511
00:50:57,916 --> 00:51:00,000
Chuck your empty bucket.

512
00:51:05,833 --> 00:51:07,375
Kannu's an angry young man.

513
00:51:24,208 --> 00:51:25,791
And now in the news...

514
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:28,916
Virat Kohli scores his 50th <i>shatak</i>.

515
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,166
<i>Shatak</i> means century.

516
00:51:31,916 --> 00:51:35,041
Everybody knows that <i>shatak</i> means century.

517
00:51:36,541 --> 00:51:37,375
Quiet.

518
00:51:37,458 --> 00:51:40,625
American President in a sex scandal.

519
00:51:40,916 --> 00:51:44,125
Son of a gun...
He turned out to be a wolf.

520
00:51:44,208 --> 00:51:45,583
- Shut up!
- How are we going to wash?

521
00:51:45,666 --> 00:51:46,916
We'll use our hands.

522
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,583
And now in local news...

523
00:51:49,541 --> 00:51:52,500
In Borivali, a <i>tendua</i> killed a child.

524
00:51:53,083 --> 00:51:54,875
- <i>Tendua</i> means...
- Lion?

525
00:51:54,958 --> 00:51:55,791
No.

526
00:51:55,875 --> 00:51:57,166
- A hyena?
- No.

527
00:51:57,250 --> 00:51:58,375
- Cheetah?
- No!

528
00:51:58,458 --> 00:52:00,291
You piece of shit, it's a leopard!

529
00:52:00,375 --> 00:52:02,041
Bro! How do we wash?

530
00:52:02,125 --> 00:52:03,500
Use your hands!

531
00:52:34,625 --> 00:52:35,833
Kannu!

532
00:52:48,083 --> 00:52:49,166
Hey...

533
00:52:50,833 --> 00:52:51,666
Hey!

534
00:52:51,750 --> 00:52:52,833
Help!

535
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:56,875
Extend your hand!

536
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:59,166
- Come on...
- Pull!

537
00:53:51,291 --> 00:53:53,333
The next time, I will build a roof too.

538
00:54:23,958 --> 00:54:25,791
Granny... Let's go.

539
00:54:28,750 --> 00:54:29,750
Come on.

540
00:54:31,375 --> 00:54:34,166
Ladies, where are you going?

541
00:54:34,458 --> 00:54:35,916
What do you mean?

542
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,291
You ladies go for a shit at 3 a.m?

543
00:54:39,250 --> 00:54:41,458
Because we can't go in daylight.

544
00:54:41,541 --> 00:54:44,041
Granny... Where are you going to?

545
00:54:44,250 --> 00:54:46,375
You know where we go.

546
00:54:46,708 --> 00:54:47,833
To shit?

547
00:54:47,958 --> 00:54:50,916
What can we do? There are no toilets here

548
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,041
and everyone has to go...

549
00:55:05,875 --> 00:55:06,750
<i>To shit?</i>

550
00:55:06,833 --> 00:55:09,500
<i>What can we do? There are no toilets here.</i>

551
00:55:12,666 --> 00:55:15,291
We want to show you
that Gandhinagar has no toilets.

552
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,666
By making such a video?

553
00:55:18,250 --> 00:55:20,833
If you don't see, how will you understand?

554
00:55:22,833 --> 00:55:27,708
Millions of kids in India sleep hungry,
mostly on streets.

555
00:55:28,291 --> 00:55:29,791
Do we fix that first

556
00:55:29,875 --> 00:55:31,500
or make you a toilet?

557
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:33,958
Whether you sleep on the street or home...

558
00:55:34,083 --> 00:55:36,250
after eating everyone's gotta shit.

559
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:38,083
Watch your tone!

560
00:55:38,166 --> 00:55:41,875
This is the problem. Earlier they
complained that they have no food to eat

561
00:55:41,958 --> 00:55:43,250
and now they want a toilet.

562
00:55:43,333 --> 00:55:46,000
These slumdogs are always complaining.

563
00:55:46,083 --> 00:55:47,583
Whom did you call a slumdog?

564
00:55:48,833 --> 00:55:50,541
Don't insult us.

565
00:55:51,208 --> 00:55:53,458
Trying to scare us?

566
00:55:53,541 --> 00:55:55,166
It's my mom who is scared...

567
00:55:57,125 --> 00:55:58,458
Please tell us...

568
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:01,458
if you can build a toilet for us.

569
00:56:04,166 --> 00:56:06,166
Hand me the legal file please.

570
00:56:07,708 --> 00:56:09,791
- You're going to explain it to the kids.
- Yes.

571
00:56:11,041 --> 00:56:12,375
Here it is.

572
00:56:13,166 --> 00:56:14,625
Here it says...

573
00:56:19,583 --> 00:56:22,000
Why are you throwing me a curve ball?

574
00:56:22,083 --> 00:56:22,916
Speak in Hindi.

575
00:56:23,583 --> 00:56:27,208
I won't let you go till you understand.

576
00:56:29,583 --> 00:56:34,000
The land on which your colony is built

577
00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:37,750
is under legal dispute
regarding ownership.

578
00:56:38,291 --> 00:56:41,583
Between Western Railway
and Bombay Municipal Corp.

579
00:56:41,666 --> 00:56:43,583
The court hasn't decided.

580
00:56:43,666 --> 00:56:48,250
Which means your colony is illegal.

581
00:56:48,333 --> 00:56:49,833
Illegal.

582
00:56:50,333 --> 00:56:51,750
What's the connection?

583
00:56:51,833 --> 00:56:53,333
Big one!

584
00:56:54,166 --> 00:56:58,333
Your colony is illegal
so no question of a toilet there.

585
00:56:58,416 --> 00:57:03,916
Also as per government records,
nobody lives there.

586
00:57:06,208 --> 00:57:07,250
But we do!

587
00:57:07,666 --> 00:57:10,625
As per them you don't even exist.

588
00:57:11,291 --> 00:57:13,083
Lady... Am I not visible to you?

589
00:57:13,166 --> 00:57:15,875
Rowdiness isn't going to work here.

590
00:57:15,958 --> 00:57:18,916
Can a toilet be built or not?

591
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:23,375
That we can't answer.

592
00:57:23,458 --> 00:57:24,541
Don't ask us.

593
00:57:24,625 --> 00:57:26,083
Then who do we ask?

594
00:57:26,166 --> 00:57:28,000
Don't trouble us.

595
00:57:28,083 --> 00:57:29,250
Go ask the Prime Minister.

596
00:57:29,333 --> 00:57:30,625
Who?

597
00:57:30,708 --> 00:57:31,833
The Prime Minister.

598
00:57:33,666 --> 00:57:34,833
Give me his phone number.

599
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:37,333
He doesn't talk over the phone.

600
00:57:37,416 --> 00:57:40,375
Why are you wasting your time? Oust them.

601
00:57:40,458 --> 00:57:42,333
Look here. This is what I have to say.

602
00:57:42,416 --> 00:57:45,583
If you want to meet the Prime Minister

603
00:57:45,958 --> 00:57:47,750
write him a letter.

604
00:57:47,833 --> 00:57:49,041
Where does that go?

605
00:57:49,291 --> 00:57:51,041
To his office in Delhi!

606
00:57:51,125 --> 00:57:52,333
He lives in Delhi?

607
00:57:52,416 --> 00:57:56,916
No, you idiot...
he lives in my pocket... Here!

608
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,833
Here's the Prime Minister...

609
00:57:59,750 --> 00:58:04,000
Here... Take... The prime minister...

610
00:58:11,625 --> 00:58:14,000
Go... Go now.

611
00:58:15,791 --> 00:58:18,083
We've seen it all.

612
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:25,333
Don't call us slumdogs.

613
00:58:28,125 --> 00:58:31,500
Your blood pressure will
shoot up over such a trivial thing...

614
00:58:46,750 --> 00:58:48,625
<i>My dear Prime Minister,</i>

615
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:51,958
<i>I am Sargam's son Kanhaiya,</i>

616
00:58:53,250 --> 00:58:56,083
<i>you can call me Kannu...</i>

617
00:58:58,208 --> 00:59:01,458
<i>In my colony no house has a toilet.</i>

618
00:59:03,333 --> 00:59:08,333
<i>We have dish TVs, refrigerators,
but no toilets.</i>

619
00:59:11,250 --> 00:59:14,208
<i>Not one in the entire colony.</i>

620
00:59:15,041 --> 00:59:17,250
<i>Everyone defecates in the open.</i>

621
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,833
<i>Sometimes on railway tracks...</i>

622
00:59:20,250 --> 00:59:21,875
<i>Sometimes on pipes...</i>

623
00:59:29,291 --> 00:59:35,916
On the day of the festival Holi...

624
00:59:37,458 --> 00:59:40,500
<i>Sainath from our colony</i>

625
00:59:40,875 --> 00:59:43,625
<i>hurt my mother.</i>

626
00:59:50,208 --> 00:59:52,125
<i>Now whenever she goes out</i>

627
00:59:53,250 --> 00:59:54,958
<i>I am scared for her.</i>

628
00:59:57,250 --> 00:59:58,750
<i>She was very sad back then.</i>

629
00:59:59,875 --> 01:00:02,083
<i>She still is.</i>

630
01:00:16,875 --> 01:00:20,250
<i>Upon seeing her sad, I cried a lot.</i>

631
01:00:25,750 --> 01:00:28,041
<i>The number you are calling
is out of coverage area.</i>

632
01:00:36,208 --> 01:00:38,208
Kannu, the TC is here.

633
01:00:51,750 --> 01:00:56,041
<i>My house is too small
for us to build a toilet in it.</i>

634
01:00:56,583 --> 01:00:59,958
<i>I made one on the hilltop...</i>

635
01:01:01,125 --> 01:01:05,750
<i>but it got washed away in the rains.</i>

636
01:01:08,375 --> 01:01:09,958
<i>I made it for Mom.</i>

637
01:01:15,875 --> 01:01:17,416
<i>I don't have a father.</i>

638
01:01:18,041 --> 01:01:19,583
<i>She is alone.</i>

639
01:02:15,791 --> 01:02:17,791
<i>You are the Prime Minister.</i>

640
01:02:18,833 --> 01:02:21,250
<i>You must have a big toilet
in your house.</i>

641
01:02:21,333 --> 01:02:23,958
<i>Imagine you didn't have a toilet</i>

642
01:02:24,041 --> 01:02:28,208
<i>and something like this
happened to your mother...</i>

643
01:02:29,250 --> 01:02:30,958
<i>How would you have felt?</i>

644
01:02:31,708 --> 01:02:34,500
<i>Please make a toilet for my mother.</i>

645
01:02:35,791 --> 01:02:39,333
<i>When I grow up and earn,
I will pay you back.</i>

646
01:02:40,750 --> 01:02:43,416
<i>My mother is my world.</i>

647
01:02:43,958 --> 01:02:46,375
<i>Yours truly, Kanhaiya from Gandhinagar.</i>

648
01:03:16,333 --> 01:03:18,125
Hail India!

649
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:21,250
Does the Prime Minister live here?

650
01:03:21,958 --> 01:03:24,416
No, the President of India lives here.

651
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:27,416
- Sir, what's the horse's name?
- Chetak.

652
01:03:28,583 --> 01:03:31,875
- Where does the Prime Minister live?
- At No. 7, Racecourse road.

653
01:03:32,916 --> 01:03:34,375
How about a selfie, boss?

654
01:03:51,041 --> 01:03:52,625
Kannu called.

655
01:03:53,250 --> 01:03:55,333
Can't he get through to me?

656
01:03:55,458 --> 01:03:56,666
What did he say?

657
01:03:56,750 --> 01:04:00,916
He went to meet the President

658
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,500
and tomorrow morning he
will go meet the Prime Minister.

659
01:04:04,166 --> 01:04:06,750
He visited the Qutub Minar too.

660
01:04:08,041 --> 01:04:09,250
Bravo!

661
01:04:10,041 --> 01:04:11,208
Is he alone?

662
01:04:11,583 --> 01:04:15,375
Ringtone and Nirala are with him,
don't worry.

663
01:04:15,458 --> 01:04:17,125
Yes, don't worry.

664
01:04:17,208 --> 01:04:19,125
I will tell Sajju to call Kannu.

665
01:04:19,208 --> 01:04:20,875
Brat! Doesn't pick up his mom's call.

666
01:04:20,958 --> 01:04:22,375
Mangla, stop!

667
01:04:23,791 --> 01:04:24,875
When did he call?

668
01:04:25,166 --> 01:04:27,125
Four times since morning.

669
01:04:27,208 --> 01:04:29,041
You kids should be slapped.

670
01:04:29,125 --> 01:04:30,583
- Me too?
- Yes.

671
01:04:30,708 --> 01:04:32,416
- Aren't you part of this plan?
- No.

672
01:04:33,250 --> 01:04:36,583
Don't whine. Next time he calls,
give her the phone.

673
01:04:37,916 --> 01:04:40,708
I don't want to talk to him.
Tell him not to come home either.

674
01:05:04,458 --> 01:05:05,500
Stop.

675
01:05:07,125 --> 01:05:08,250
Where are you going?

676
01:05:08,375 --> 01:05:09,708
To meet the prime minister.

677
01:05:09,791 --> 01:05:11,166
You aren't school kids.

678
01:05:11,250 --> 01:05:13,708
We just don't have uniforms.

679
01:05:13,791 --> 01:05:14,750
Then you can't enter.

680
01:05:14,833 --> 01:05:16,875
We've come from Mumbai. Please, sir.

681
01:05:16,958 --> 01:05:20,333
Sir, we want to meet the Prime Minister.

682
01:05:20,416 --> 01:05:23,250
- Son, you don't have the permission.
- How come the others do?

683
01:05:35,625 --> 01:05:39,791
C'mon kids, scram.

684
01:05:40,625 --> 01:05:42,916
Sir, please we want
to meet the Prime Minister.

685
01:05:43,041 --> 01:05:47,791
Please, we must meet the Prime Minister.

686
01:06:47,166 --> 01:06:49,166
Kids, it's your turn.

687
01:07:03,333 --> 01:07:04,750
What are your names?

688
01:07:05,375 --> 01:07:06,375
Kannu.

689
01:07:06,625 --> 01:07:08,250
- Nirala.
- Ringtone.

690
01:07:11,791 --> 01:07:13,541
Why were you creating a ruckus?

691
01:07:13,625 --> 01:07:15,625
We want to meet the Prime Minister.

692
01:07:17,166 --> 01:07:18,708
That's not possible.

693
01:07:18,833 --> 01:07:20,250
Then how is it possible?

694
01:07:20,375 --> 01:07:24,625
All the details are on the website.
You need to take an appointment.

695
01:07:24,708 --> 01:07:27,750
We've come from Mumbai.

696
01:07:28,583 --> 01:07:29,625
What brings you here?

697
01:07:29,708 --> 01:07:31,208
We want to give him a letter.

698
01:07:34,916 --> 01:07:36,458
Are you the Prime Minister?

699
01:07:37,375 --> 01:07:38,291
No.

700
01:07:45,875 --> 01:07:48,250
The thing is we want to make a toilet.

701
01:07:49,333 --> 01:07:52,000
For that you need to go to
Mumbai Municipal Corporation.

702
01:07:52,083 --> 01:07:54,041
They said they can't help.

703
01:07:54,125 --> 01:07:58,208
And all decisions are taken
with the Prime Minister's consent.

704
01:08:03,833 --> 01:08:05,333
The Japanese delegation is here.

705
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:08,416
They were to come
on Wednesday morning, right?

706
01:08:09,083 --> 01:08:11,125
The secretary preponed it.

707
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:19,625
You've come this far
just to give a letter?

708
01:08:19,708 --> 01:08:22,333
We'll roam around Delhi if we get time.

709
01:08:23,333 --> 01:08:25,541
No, just the letter.

710
01:08:27,583 --> 01:08:30,708
Kannu's written it himself.

711
01:08:33,750 --> 01:08:35,250
Our work will be done, right?

712
01:08:36,875 --> 01:08:39,458
Look, I can just receive it.

713
01:08:39,958 --> 01:08:41,291
The rest is up to the system.

714
01:08:41,375 --> 01:08:42,833
Where do we find him?

715
01:08:44,541 --> 01:08:46,625
- Who?
- Mr. System.

716
01:08:50,250 --> 01:08:52,083
This toilet is for my mother.

717
01:08:52,583 --> 01:08:53,791
Please help.

718
01:09:51,416 --> 01:09:52,375
Guess who?

719
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:56,958
You deserve a tight slap!

720
01:09:58,500 --> 01:10:00,083
How dare you go without asking me?

721
01:10:00,291 --> 01:10:02,916
You'd have scolded and put me
to sleep if I had asked you.

722
01:10:16,958 --> 01:10:18,458
I'm super hungry.

723
01:10:19,125 --> 01:10:20,666
I haven't eaten for three days.

724
01:10:20,791 --> 01:10:23,125
Rabiya, make something special.

725
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:26,791
Egg curry? Great!

726
01:10:26,875 --> 01:10:29,291
First, you need a good scrubbing.

727
01:10:33,125 --> 01:10:34,541
What all did you see there?

728
01:10:35,083 --> 01:10:36,000
Taj Mahal.

729
01:10:36,208 --> 01:10:38,333
Taj Mahal? In Delhi?

730
01:10:40,333 --> 01:10:41,791
I saw it from the train...

731
01:10:42,208 --> 01:10:44,708
Your favorite <i>khichdi</i>.

732
01:10:47,458 --> 01:10:48,833
At your service, Your Majesty.

733
01:10:50,541 --> 01:10:52,333
Here, the receipt.

734
01:10:53,916 --> 01:10:54,791
Receipt?

735
01:10:55,708 --> 01:10:57,458
With the Prime Minister's stamp.

736
01:10:58,208 --> 01:11:00,041
I've spoken to him.

737
01:11:02,625 --> 01:11:03,875
Our work will be done.

738
01:11:04,958 --> 01:11:06,541
Look at you. All grown up.

739
01:11:06,750 --> 01:11:08,416
Met the Prime Minister!

740
01:11:09,791 --> 01:11:11,500
I'll do anything for mom.

741
01:11:12,458 --> 01:11:15,500
Just tell her to make the food more spicy.

742
01:11:20,083 --> 01:11:26,416
<i>Kanna, my darling Kanna</i>

743
01:11:39,125 --> 01:11:44,041
<i>My tiny bite of sugarcane</i>

744
01:11:55,291 --> 01:12:00,416
<i>My little liar, my little king</i>

745
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:05,416
<i>My diamond-like emerald ring</i>

746
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:29,375
<i>In your bungalow, Kanna,
Will be a hundred toilets</i>

747
01:12:37,125 --> 01:12:43,750
<i>Creating your own palace in the shanty</i>

748
01:12:45,791 --> 01:12:51,125
<i>Clouds may not gather over these, my pet</i>

749
01:12:51,208 --> 01:12:57,750
<i>In your ma's eyes, there's water aplenty</i>

750
01:12:59,083 --> 01:13:05,750
<i>Those distant stars,
Kanhaiya, are all an illusion</i>

751
01:13:15,166 --> 01:13:20,166
<i>Don't step on them
They will prick your feet</i>

752
01:13:35,083 --> 01:13:37,083
Mom, our toilet is ready.

753
01:13:49,166 --> 01:13:51,791
Mom... Our toilet is ready!

754
01:13:53,708 --> 01:13:56,000
You've peed in your bed.

755
01:13:57,958 --> 01:14:00,291
It happens... Go take a bath.

756
01:14:01,208 --> 01:14:03,541
All grown up, huh?

757
01:14:06,125 --> 01:14:07,208
Come on. Get up.

758
01:14:08,458 --> 01:14:10,083
Went to Delhi and everything!

759
01:14:27,458 --> 01:14:29,291
Are there toilets in flights too?

760
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:31,875
Duh!

761
01:14:32,333 --> 01:14:35,083
You think big shots
can hold on for so long?

762
01:14:36,375 --> 01:14:38,333
God has made us all equal.

763
01:14:40,083 --> 01:14:44,000
The only difference is
they shit in flights

764
01:14:44,416 --> 01:14:45,916
and we shit on railway tracks.

765
01:14:58,416 --> 01:15:00,125
Look! A shooting star!

766
01:15:06,333 --> 01:15:07,375
What did you wish for?

767
01:15:07,458 --> 01:15:09,625
If I tell, it won't come true.

768
01:15:10,291 --> 01:15:11,708
And you, Kannu?

769
01:15:13,166 --> 01:15:15,291
I didn't notice it. Else I would've...

770
01:15:17,541 --> 01:15:20,375
Don't stress. The toilet will be made.

771
01:15:21,291 --> 01:15:22,791
You are just saying that.

772
01:15:24,708 --> 01:15:27,000
Wishing gets you nothing, action does.

773
01:15:27,125 --> 01:15:28,750
Only one man can do it.

774
01:15:29,416 --> 01:15:31,000
- Who?
- Your father?

775
01:15:32,583 --> 01:15:34,500
No. The father to all of us.

776
01:15:34,625 --> 01:15:36,916
- Who?
- Gandhiji.

777
01:15:38,041 --> 01:15:40,541
He's been dead for ages now.

778
01:15:44,125 --> 01:15:45,125
Show me that.

779
01:15:47,583 --> 01:15:49,166
Let me take a picture.

780
01:15:50,041 --> 01:15:53,583
Kannu acts dead
and we collect money for his funeral.

781
01:15:55,833 --> 01:15:57,666
Nobody laughs!

782
01:15:57,750 --> 01:15:59,416
If anyone laughs, our plan will fail.

783
01:16:02,625 --> 01:16:04,833
<i>For no rhyme or reason</i>

784
01:16:05,125 --> 01:16:11,000
<i>God wakes us up every morning</i>

785
01:16:12,541 --> 01:16:16,916
<i>Temple bells ring</i>

786
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,666
<i>Every morning</i>

787
01:16:23,708 --> 01:16:26,833
<i>If not deaf</i>

788
01:16:28,791 --> 01:16:32,250
<i>Why doesn't he hear us?</i>

789
01:16:33,583 --> 01:16:37,166
<i>If not dumb</i>

790
01:16:38,666 --> 01:16:43,125
<i>Well, if He doesn't listen, will you?</i>

791
01:16:44,833 --> 01:16:49,291
<i>My dear Prime Minister</i>

792
01:16:49,791 --> 01:16:52,833
<i>Please do listen to my plea</i>

793
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,750
- Donate for building a temple please!
- Get aside...

794
01:16:57,833 --> 01:17:00,000
- To build a temple.
- Give him something, please.

795
01:17:00,083 --> 01:17:02,041
<i>The rest is your wish Listen to us</i>

796
01:17:02,125 --> 01:17:03,416
- For a temple?
- Yes.

797
01:17:06,958 --> 01:17:08,916
Please donate for building a mosque.

798
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:10,250
You're doing God's work.

799
01:17:10,333 --> 01:17:13,625
- Where are you building it?
- Well... Behind Gandhinagar.

800
01:17:14,625 --> 01:17:15,708
Here.

801
01:17:33,083 --> 01:17:37,500
<i>If God is deaf So be it...</i>

802
01:17:38,166 --> 01:17:42,666
<i>Salute the one
Who gives money...</i>

803
01:17:47,708 --> 01:17:53,041
<i>If God is deaf
So be it...</i>

804
01:17:53,125 --> 01:17:57,958
<i>Salute the one
Who gives money...</i>

805
01:17:58,041 --> 01:18:02,750
<i>You are the government
Give us cowsheds too...</i>

806
01:18:02,833 --> 01:18:07,500
<i>Given us slums, now give us toilets too</i>

807
01:18:07,583 --> 01:18:13,000
<i>I plead you It's all up to you</i>

808
01:18:14,291 --> 01:18:18,375
<i>My dear Prime Minister</i>

809
01:18:19,041 --> 01:18:22,041
<i>Please do listen to my plea</i>

810
01:18:24,041 --> 01:18:28,333
<i>My dear Prime Minister</i>

811
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:32,666
<i>The rest is up to you
Do consider my plea</i>

812
01:18:44,333 --> 01:18:45,958
It's me Pappu Pandey.

813
01:18:48,833 --> 01:18:50,416
May I have a word with you?

814
01:19:04,083 --> 01:19:05,375
Kannu isn't home.

815
01:19:06,666 --> 01:19:08,875
I came to see you.

816
01:19:11,958 --> 01:19:15,125
Because of what you went through...

817
01:19:17,208 --> 01:19:20,708
you have become extremely sad.

818
01:19:23,708 --> 01:19:27,791
Your sadness makes me sad too.

819
01:19:31,541 --> 01:19:34,666
I was thinking...

820
01:19:36,541 --> 01:19:38,625
You should get tested.

821
01:19:40,708 --> 01:19:42,041
I'm not pregnant.

822
01:19:43,083 --> 01:19:44,291
Not for that.

823
01:19:45,791 --> 01:19:47,041
I mean...

824
01:19:48,791 --> 01:19:51,875
...for sexually transmitted diseases.

825
01:20:01,041 --> 01:20:02,166
I...

826
01:20:04,083 --> 01:20:05,583
I should leave.

827
01:21:02,583 --> 01:21:04,708
What tests?

828
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:07,083
A blood test.

829
01:21:07,333 --> 01:21:10,291
But what do you want it tested for?

830
01:21:11,208 --> 01:21:13,291
Diabetes...

831
01:21:14,833 --> 01:21:16,000
Blood Pressure...

832
01:21:16,333 --> 01:21:19,708
- And STD.
- And what?

833
01:21:20,250 --> 01:21:21,625
Sexually transmitted diseases.

834
01:21:24,958 --> 01:21:26,583
- For you?
- Yes.

835
01:21:28,333 --> 01:21:29,541
Okay. Come in.

836
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,500
Why don't you too, as you are here?

837
01:21:41,958 --> 01:21:42,958
Come in.

838
01:22:31,083 --> 01:22:32,458
Why did you get the test done?

839
01:22:34,625 --> 01:22:37,000
Since you were feeling shy...

840
01:23:03,208 --> 01:23:05,791
I was 16 when I first fell in love.

841
01:23:07,666 --> 01:23:10,083
When he found out about Kannu...

842
01:23:12,458 --> 01:23:13,708
he ran away.

843
01:23:17,375 --> 01:23:21,625
And I came to Mumbai... All alone.

844
01:23:34,333 --> 01:23:39,791
My father had a bookstore in Allahabad.

845
01:23:44,125 --> 01:23:46,333
I would always be there.

846
01:23:48,500 --> 01:23:50,208
Because I loved to read.

847
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:56,541
Then as if, all of a sudden,
people stopped reading.

848
01:24:00,875 --> 01:24:02,791
The shutters came down.

849
01:24:04,625 --> 01:24:06,375
And I came to Mumbai
in search of work.

850
01:24:09,375 --> 01:24:10,875
Whatever I earn...

851
01:24:15,041 --> 01:24:17,000
I send half of it to my family.

852
01:24:21,750 --> 01:24:24,958
We can manage with the rest.

853
01:24:27,875 --> 01:24:30,375
My embroidery work is going well too.

854
01:24:32,708 --> 01:24:35,500
I can take on more if needed.

855
01:24:39,791 --> 01:24:41,125
You won't have to.

856
01:26:11,666 --> 01:26:13,666
- Take it.
- Here, take it.

857
01:26:16,041 --> 01:26:20,125
- How much have we got?
- Rs. 1100.

858
01:26:21,708 --> 01:26:23,458
Here's more.

859
01:26:25,166 --> 01:26:29,000
- Where is the temple being built, son?
- Behind Gandhinagar.

860
01:26:30,166 --> 01:26:33,291
- Ahead of the pipes.
- Behind the water tank.

861
01:26:33,583 --> 01:26:34,791
And the mosque?

862
01:26:43,833 --> 01:26:45,791
You pipsqueak! Bribing the police?

863
01:27:04,583 --> 01:27:05,875
What did you do?

864
01:27:08,791 --> 01:27:10,500
What did you do?

865
01:27:10,583 --> 01:27:12,000
Run, Kannu. Run.

866
01:27:45,750 --> 01:27:48,375
- What did you kids do?
- Nothing.

867
01:28:17,708 --> 01:28:20,583
You'll steal money? Rob people?

868
01:28:21,958 --> 01:28:23,916
It's for your toilet that I need money.

869
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,541
Is this how you'll protect me?

870
01:28:26,708 --> 01:28:29,041
By becoming a criminal?

871
01:28:29,125 --> 01:28:33,083
- Your toilet will never get built!
- Then I will die!

872
01:28:33,166 --> 01:28:34,833
I'll die instead, problem solved!

873
01:28:34,916 --> 01:28:38,125
- Let's get home.
- No.

874
01:28:38,500 --> 01:28:41,666
Come to the temple.

875
01:28:41,750 --> 01:28:43,666
No, I won't!

876
01:28:44,666 --> 01:28:46,416
Fold your hands...

877
01:28:47,708 --> 01:28:48,541
No, I won't.

878
01:28:48,625 --> 01:28:50,458
Now apologize to God.

879
01:28:51,750 --> 01:28:54,125
Swear you will
never do wrong things again.

880
01:28:58,833 --> 01:29:02,833
Why do you need a temple?
We need a toilet, not a temple.

881
01:29:04,125 --> 01:29:05,791
Say sorry.

882
01:29:06,125 --> 01:29:08,916
You are the one who got raped,
why should I apologize?

883
01:29:09,583 --> 01:29:11,416
Tell God to apologize to you.

884
01:29:14,250 --> 01:29:16,791
I won't apologize to Him.

885
01:30:27,708 --> 01:30:29,208
Why are you sitting alone, bro?

886
01:30:31,583 --> 01:30:34,583
- See that building?
- Which one?

887
01:30:38,583 --> 01:30:40,250
They are all buildings.

888
01:30:41,208 --> 01:30:42,541
That one?

889
01:30:43,333 --> 01:30:44,708
Bro, that one.

890
01:30:45,708 --> 01:30:46,958
Umm, that one?

891
01:30:47,625 --> 01:30:50,916
Whatever. You see them, right?

892
01:30:52,250 --> 01:30:53,708
Count the floors.

893
01:30:55,125 --> 01:31:00,583
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight...

894
01:31:02,625 --> 01:31:03,916
- Shit, missed.
- 50.

895
01:31:04,375 --> 01:31:08,541
- How do you know?
- What do you think I've been doing?

896
01:31:08,958 --> 01:31:10,583
One building of 50 floors.

897
01:31:10,958 --> 01:31:14,500
One floor with 10 flats, so 500 flats.

898
01:31:14,625 --> 01:31:17,875
- Two BHK.
- Two BHK means?

899
01:31:18,375 --> 01:31:21,041
- Two bedrooms, hall, kitchen.
- And 2 toilets.

900
01:31:21,708 --> 01:31:26,000
Each has 2 toilets, so 1000 toilets?

901
01:31:28,166 --> 01:31:30,458
All in just one building, right?

902
01:31:31,083 --> 01:31:33,208
There are many such buildings in Mumbai.

903
01:31:35,791 --> 01:31:36,833
Look behind you.

904
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:40,708
And look at our Gandhinagar.

905
01:31:43,458 --> 01:31:47,416
Thousands of people
but not a single toilet.

906
01:32:01,583 --> 01:32:04,541
You know what I wished for
from the shooting star?

907
01:32:05,375 --> 01:32:07,375
-I know
-What?

908
01:32:08,666 --> 01:32:09,791
It's me.

909
01:32:17,791 --> 01:32:19,375
Does Kanhaiya live here?

910
01:32:20,666 --> 01:32:24,083
I'm asking if Kanhaiya lives here.

911
01:32:24,166 --> 01:32:26,000
Yes. What's he done now?

912
01:32:26,083 --> 01:32:29,416
- What happened?
- Come with me.

913
01:32:29,500 --> 01:32:30,916
What's the rush?

914
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,041
- Pomfret.
- Pomfret.

915
01:32:33,125 --> 01:32:35,416
- Hurry.
- Let's go quickly.

916
01:32:36,500 --> 01:32:41,833
You were asking where Kanhaiya lives.
Now you are doubting her.

917
01:32:41,916 --> 01:32:45,458
Don't confuse me now.
Just tell me if he lives here or not.

918
01:32:45,583 --> 01:32:46,750
What's happening?

919
01:32:46,958 --> 01:32:49,708
He had written a letter for a toilet?

920
01:32:50,083 --> 01:32:52,583
It's reached the Prime Minister!

921
01:32:52,666 --> 01:32:54,333
Can't you speak softly?

922
01:32:58,708 --> 01:33:02,375
The letter Kannu wrote
reached the Prime Minister, Rabiya.

923
01:33:06,375 --> 01:33:08,916
- Kannu did it!
- I'll get him.

924
01:33:20,458 --> 01:33:22,833
There... Pomfret...

925
01:33:33,458 --> 01:33:35,083
This boat is the fish boat?

926
01:33:39,291 --> 01:33:40,708
Granny was right all along.

927
01:33:41,541 --> 01:33:44,583
Yes... Big fishes...

928
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:52,208
Big fishes.

929
01:33:56,875 --> 01:33:57,958
What?

930
01:33:58,458 --> 01:33:59,458
Hurry up!

931
01:33:59,958 --> 01:34:02,083
The Prime Minister has agreed.

932
01:34:02,916 --> 01:34:04,125
The toilet will be made!

933
01:34:04,208 --> 01:34:05,458
Liar!

934
01:34:06,375 --> 01:34:07,750
I swear, he has.

935
01:34:07,833 --> 01:34:09,291
I'm coming.

936
01:34:09,375 --> 01:34:10,625
Quick.

937
01:34:11,333 --> 01:34:14,708
- The Prime Minister from Delhi?
- The toilet will be made, Kannu.

938
01:34:14,791 --> 01:34:16,250
Really?

939
01:34:24,666 --> 01:34:25,625
Kannu!

940
01:34:28,375 --> 01:34:30,250
Somebody please help Kannu.

941
01:34:36,083 --> 01:34:37,125
Someone help!

942
01:34:51,500 --> 01:34:54,416
Someone save him!

943
01:34:57,125 --> 01:35:00,291
Somebody please help my friend.

944
01:35:00,375 --> 01:35:05,291
Please save him!

945
01:36:30,250 --> 01:36:31,541
Why did you jump?

946
01:36:31,750 --> 01:36:33,166
Ringtone did too.

947
01:36:34,791 --> 01:36:36,333
To save his ass.

948
01:36:48,875 --> 01:36:51,291
Your toilet is going to be built.

949
01:36:55,708 --> 01:36:58,291
<i>Now we don't go near the pipes.</i>

950
01:36:58,916 --> 01:37:03,708
<i>I mean, we do but only to play
or to take a shortcut.</i>

951
01:37:05,041 --> 01:37:08,916
<i>A few days ago our toilet was built.</i>

952
01:37:09,333 --> 01:37:11,791
<i>Not private but a public one.</i>

953
01:37:15,291 --> 01:37:18,625
<i>It had to happen.</i>

954
01:37:19,125 --> 01:37:21,125
<i>After all I had spoken to
the Prime Minister.</i>

955
01:37:22,916 --> 01:37:25,750
<i>Now we will be free
of our problems in the morning.</i>

956
01:37:40,875 --> 01:37:44,375
- Bravo!
- Hey!

957
01:37:45,291 --> 01:37:47,583
When you gotta go, you gotta go.

958
01:39:01,791 --> 01:39:05,708
What's the joke, Sargam?

959
01:39:06,375 --> 01:39:07,666
It's nothing.

960
01:39:09,375 --> 01:39:12,041
Come on, tell us too.

961
01:39:12,125 --> 01:39:14,000
Nothing's happening.

962
01:39:20,791 --> 01:39:23,000
Rabiya, what's not happening?

963
01:39:23,833 --> 01:39:25,125
Where are the taps?

964
01:39:25,791 --> 01:39:29,083
Taps? Didn't you carry water?

965
01:39:31,166 --> 01:39:32,833
Switch off the lights please.

966
01:39:34,333 --> 01:39:35,416
Why?

967
01:39:35,583 --> 01:39:37,083
I feel shy shitting under light!

968
01:39:40,958 --> 01:39:42,791
Switch off the lights please.

969
01:40:37,958 --> 01:40:42,458
<i>...My dear Prime Minister</i>

970
01:40:47,750 --> 01:40:52,583
{\an8}...<i>My dear Prime Minister</i>
