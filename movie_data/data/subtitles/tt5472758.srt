1
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,050
A very crucial matter for Pakistan and India.

2
00:01:35,641 --> 00:01:40,641
That this year onwards, we'll not just be exporting Sapotas, but Mangoes as well.

3
00:01:41,141 --> 00:01:43,766
We're sending some fruit samples on behalf of India...

4
00:01:44,266 --> 00:01:47,350
...with the Pakistani delegates as a gesture.

5
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:51,141
The ex-Governor of Lahore, Mr. Javed Ahmed is amongst us.

6
00:01:51,641 --> 00:01:55,141
I would request him to say a few words.

7
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,141
Thank you. Thank you very much.

8
00:02:00,641 --> 00:02:03,516
This isn't just an Agro-Trade Conference for me.

9
00:02:04,016 --> 00:02:06,975
It is also an important occasion.

10
00:02:07,475 --> 00:02:12,933
This is my son and the future leader of Pakistan...

11
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:17,058
...Bilal Ahmed's first international conference.

12
00:02:17,558 --> 00:02:19,183
With permission from our respected Conference Head...

13
00:02:19,683 --> 00:02:23,433
...I would like Bilal Ahmed to conclude this conference.

14
00:02:23,933 --> 00:02:28,975
Ladies and Gentlemen, Bilal Ahmed!

15
00:02:29,475 --> 00:02:32,975
Where is he?

16
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:38,100
Bilal Ahmed... he'll be here in a second...

17
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,100
Bilal!

18
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:40,975
Bilal!

19
00:02:41,475 --> 00:02:42,350
This is too much!

20
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:43,850
You're supposed to be the next Jinnah...

21
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:45,183
...and you're here peeing.

22
00:02:45,683 --> 00:02:46,391
Are you sure he's inside? - Yes.

23
00:02:46,891 --> 00:02:50,391
Then open the door.

24
00:03:06,266 --> 00:03:07,641
Sukhi, get the new ball.

25
00:03:08,141 --> 00:03:09,350
We've already lost two.

26
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:11,725
I told you don't let some random stranger play.

27
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:13,058
If we lose this one too...

28
00:03:13,558 --> 00:03:16,933
...then no one gets to bat. - Of course not.

29
00:03:17,433 --> 00:03:18,725
Because I am going to knock this ball...

30
00:03:19,225 --> 00:03:22,808
...out of Lahore's Gaddafi stadium too.

31
00:03:23,308 --> 00:03:25,766
Lahore?

32
00:03:26,266 --> 00:03:27,516
Brother ... - Yes?

33
00:03:28,016 --> 00:03:31,516
Are you a Pakistani? - Yes Sir!

34
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,850
Brother, you could've told me before that you're a Pakistani.

35
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:56,850
I wasted two balls for no reason.

36
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,308
Our brother's fianc Happy, is just stunning.

37
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:04,683
You know, like rose syrup mixed in sweet buttermilk.

38
00:04:05,183 --> 00:04:07,433
I've heard that Happy was also Ms. Amritsar?

39
00:04:07,933 --> 00:04:09,058
She could've been Ms. India bro...

40
00:04:09,558 --> 00:04:13,058
...but our brother convinced her father at the right time.

41
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:21,100
Long live brother Bagga.

42
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,725
Hello, boss!

43
00:04:23,225 --> 00:04:24,266
Hello father-in-law!

44
00:04:24,766 --> 00:04:26,391
Oh, hello son

45
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:30,475
Come come... God bless you!

46
00:04:30,975 --> 00:04:34,475
Amazing.

47
00:04:40,433 --> 00:04:43,933
Long live brother Bagga.

48
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,725
Is that even an explanation Bilal?

49
00:04:51,225 --> 00:04:53,308
I brought you here to introduce you to everyone...

50
00:04:53,808 --> 00:04:55,391
...and you slipped out again?

51
00:04:55,891 --> 00:04:57,975
Why did you come all the way from Lahore to Amritsar?

52
00:04:58,475 --> 00:05:00,016
To play?

53
00:05:00,516 --> 00:05:03,683
Look Bilal, you're supposed to be the next Jinnah.

54
00:05:04,183 --> 00:05:07,100
And I want no more mistakes.

55
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:07,933
What?

56
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:09,516
No more mistakes.

57
00:05:10,016 --> 00:05:13,516
Good. Come.

58
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:17,516
This is going to be fun, they'll be coming from that side.

59
00:05:18,016 --> 00:05:19,516
Come on, come on.

60
00:05:20,016 --> 00:05:22,641
Hello? Excuse me!

61
00:05:23,141 --> 00:05:25,225
What...what do you want?

62
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:26,641
Nothing.

63
00:05:27,141 --> 00:05:30,933
I just came to deliver the flowers. - Then deliver them.

64
00:05:31,433 --> 00:05:31,516
I already did.

65
00:05:32,016 --> 00:05:33,141
Then should I lay out dinner for you now?

66
00:05:33,641 --> 00:05:36,433
Or you'll have desert? - No, it's okay.

67
00:05:36,933 --> 00:05:38,350
Then get going.

68
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:40,266
God knows they come from?

69
00:05:40,766 --> 00:05:44,350
On the occasion of our brother's wedding...

70
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:49,933
...Mr...Mr. Daman Singh Bagga will be performing on stage.

71
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:53,933
Let's give him a big round of applause.

72
00:06:02,933 --> 00:06:04,725
Play the song properly.

73
00:06:05,225 --> 00:06:07,641
It's your brother's wedding.

74
00:06:08,141 --> 00:06:11,641
My brother's wedding?

75
00:06:14,141 --> 00:06:16,058
"O Sweetheart..."

76
00:06:16,558 --> 00:06:18,141
"I wonder what's going to be..."

77
00:06:18,641 --> 00:06:23,225
"...the fate of us meeting."

78
00:06:23,725 --> 00:06:25,600
"My heart cannot live"

79
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:32,350
"...a moment without you."

80
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:37,308
"Your style... your eyes... and your smile."

81
00:06:37,808 --> 00:06:42,058
"Your charm... My heart's crazy about you."

82
00:06:42,558 --> 00:06:44,475
"There's color...there's beauty."

83
00:06:44,975 --> 00:06:46,975
"And the procession of my dreams."

84
00:06:47,475 --> 00:06:49,308
"There is nothing more I want."

85
00:06:49,808 --> 00:06:52,308
"Heaven is with me."

86
00:06:52,808 --> 00:06:56,975
Happy! You had to go now only? - Why? Does it inform you before?

87
00:06:57,475 --> 00:06:58,808
Please hurry up.

88
00:06:59,308 --> 00:07:01,683
Can I pee now?

89
00:07:02,183 --> 00:07:03,641
"O Sweetheart..."

90
00:07:04,141 --> 00:07:06,058
"I wonder what's going to be..."

91
00:07:06,558 --> 00:07:10,891
"...the fate of us meeting."

92
00:07:11,391 --> 00:07:14,141
"My heart cannot live..."

93
00:07:14,641 --> 00:07:17,100
"...a moment without you."

94
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,141
Hello, Guddu? - Hello Happy!

95
00:07:18,641 --> 00:07:19,725
It's the flower truck, right?

96
00:07:20,225 --> 00:07:21,016
Okay, okay hang up.

97
00:07:21,516 --> 00:07:25,016
Love you.

98
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:35,850
Happy! Happy?

99
00:08:06,725 --> 00:08:07,391
Oh Guddu.

100
00:08:07,891 --> 00:08:09,266
Where have you reached? - What do you mean reached?

101
00:08:09,766 --> 00:08:10,891
I'll reach if I leave!

102
00:08:11,391 --> 00:08:12,225
Then Why haven't you left? - So I'll leave?

103
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:14,683
Idiot, Happy's already jumped out of the window.

104
00:08:15,183 --> 00:08:16,850
Where? - In the river you fool.

105
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:18,975
You went there with your flower truck, didn't you?

106
00:08:19,475 --> 00:08:21,766
Okay hold on, stay on the line, let me check.

107
00:08:22,266 --> 00:08:23,016
What do you mean by check?

108
00:08:23,516 --> 00:08:24,475
Sister-in-law.

109
00:08:24,975 --> 00:08:25,766
Sister-in-law Happy.

110
00:08:26,266 --> 00:08:27,183
Sister-in-law. - What are you doing?

111
00:08:27,683 --> 00:08:29,766
Winkle! Winkle! - Wasting my time.

112
00:08:30,266 --> 00:08:31,641
You think Happy will get lost in my truck?

113
00:08:32,141 --> 00:08:33,725
She's neither in the Truck, nor at the window.

114
00:08:34,225 --> 00:08:37,725
Then where did Happy go?

115
00:08:42,266 --> 00:08:45,766
Boss, it's confirmed. She ran away!

116
00:09:12,016 --> 00:09:14,100
You see Mr. father-in-law!

117
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,725
..I gave a solo performance on stage.

118
00:09:17,225 --> 00:09:18,725
Called a choreographer all the way from Mumbai.

119
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:23,308
Paid him 140,000 Rupees.

120
00:09:23,808 --> 00:09:25,183
This bloody orchestra...

121
00:09:25,683 --> 00:09:27,016
He could've come in a bus.

122
00:09:27,516 --> 00:09:32,933
But I paid for his AC two-tier ticket...

123
00:09:33,433 --> 00:09:36,808
I stocked your bar with scotch.

124
00:09:37,308 --> 00:09:42,308
Being a corporator, I have spent like a minister!

125
00:09:42,808 --> 00:09:45,350
And what happened?

126
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:46,183
What happened?

127
00:09:46,683 --> 00:09:50,183
Sister-in-law ran away. - Ran away.

128
00:09:54,225 --> 00:09:57,766
The wedding cards were distributed!

129
00:09:58,266 --> 00:10:01,058
Guddu!

130
00:10:01,558 --> 00:10:02,641
Listen to me, Guddu.

131
00:10:03,141 --> 00:10:04,516
Maybe she got scared at the last moment and didn't jump.

132
00:10:05,016 --> 00:10:05,933
Maybe she is coming an other way.

133
00:10:06,433 --> 00:10:07,350
And... - And what?

134
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:09,850
Maybe Bagga's opposition party kidnapped sister-in-law.

135
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:10,850
He's the Corporator of the city.

136
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:11,475
Hold this.

137
00:10:11,975 --> 00:10:13,266
Only a fool will kidnap his bride.

138
00:10:13,766 --> 00:10:15,433
But that is what you were doing.

139
00:10:15,933 --> 00:10:17,141
I love Happy, understand?

140
00:10:17,641 --> 00:10:18,808
Very nice - Now?

141
00:10:19,308 --> 00:10:20,225
Now what? Get on the bike.

142
00:10:20,725 --> 00:10:21,891
Where to?

143
00:10:22,391 --> 00:10:23,475
We'll find Happy.

144
00:10:23,975 --> 00:10:26,350
But Guddu my truck is parked here. - What's going to happen to your truck?

145
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,016
Come back for it later.

146
00:10:28,516 --> 00:10:32,016
Papa will kill me

147
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:50,391
Brother, there's no one inside.

148
00:10:50,891 --> 00:10:54,391
What are you looking at? Destroy everything.

149
00:11:01,391 --> 00:11:04,600
Father...this is the same truck that was parked outside our house.

150
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,600
The driver was there too.

151
00:11:33,725 --> 00:11:36,058
It's a diplomatic convoy Sir, We have free passage.

152
00:11:36,558 --> 00:11:38,225
There's no checking, let me see

153
00:11:38,725 --> 00:11:40,350
The truck belongs to us. Indian.

154
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:42,350
We're simply delivering gifts to Lahore.

155
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:43,850
We'll return tonight itself.

156
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:44,683
Please have a look...

157
00:11:45,183 --> 00:11:46,516
We got the radio message for 15 minutes ago.

158
00:11:47,016 --> 00:11:47,766
What kept you?

159
00:11:48,266 --> 00:11:49,516
There was a wedding happening on the way.

160
00:11:50,016 --> 00:11:51,016
...and they stopped our truck for no reason.

161
00:11:51,516 --> 00:11:51,933
Fine, fine...come...

162
00:11:52,433 --> 00:11:55,933
Come on, Yeshwant.

163
00:12:13,225 --> 00:12:16,725
Greetings. - Greetings.

164
00:12:21,016 --> 00:12:22,100
Look Son.

165
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,975
This is the response we got from a single trade delegation.

166
00:12:25,475 --> 00:12:27,516
And this is just the beginning.

167
00:12:28,016 --> 00:12:30,475
And you...wanted to be a cricketer.

168
00:12:30,975 --> 00:12:33,266
If you follow my guidance, then I am sure...

169
00:12:33,766 --> 00:12:37,850
...one day you will change the history of Pakistan.

170
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:40,058
Ishtiyaq Sir is coming from Islamabad tomorrow. - Yes.

171
00:12:40,558 --> 00:12:41,975
I want you to meet him. - Yes, father.

172
00:12:42,475 --> 00:12:46,100
Proud of you.

173
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,100
...and fruits are good for you!

174
00:12:53,225 --> 00:12:54,933
Lets have some real breakfast!

175
00:12:55,433 --> 00:12:56,891
This is what you call breakfast!

176
00:12:57,391 --> 00:12:59,725
Mr. Junior. Please be careful.

177
00:13:00,225 --> 00:13:00,975
It will increase your cholesterol.

178
00:13:01,475 --> 00:13:02,683
Let something increase uncle.

179
00:13:03,183 --> 00:13:05,391
My whole life father has never let anything but my height increase!

180
00:13:05,891 --> 00:13:08,391
Please stop dotting him while he eats.

181
00:13:08,891 --> 00:13:11,475
Aunty, your niece Huriya...

182
00:13:11,975 --> 00:13:13,350
Did she finalize a design for her necklace?

183
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:15,891
Would have if it was a Pakistani design.

184
00:13:16,391 --> 00:13:19,516
She saw some Indian actress wearing it

185
00:13:20,016 --> 00:13:20,975
What's her name?

186
00:13:21,475 --> 00:13:23,391
She's quite popular.

187
00:13:23,891 --> 00:13:24,516
Kareena Kaif.

188
00:13:25,016 --> 00:13:27,350
Try to understand,

189
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:29,933
If it's Kareena she must be Kapoor.

190
00:13:30,433 --> 00:13:31,516
Kaif is Katrina.

191
00:13:32,016 --> 00:13:34,225
Are they your nieces?

192
00:13:34,725 --> 00:13:38,225
You keep moving away from the topic.

193
00:13:49,975 --> 00:13:52,350
The crate is moving. - It's a basket.

194
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:53,891
What's the difference between a crate and basket?

195
00:13:54,391 --> 00:13:57,891
The same that is between Kareena and Katrina.

196
00:14:13,975 --> 00:14:15,475
Who are you? - Who are you?

197
00:14:15,975 --> 00:14:17,308
I am Happy. - Who Happy?

198
00:14:17,808 --> 00:14:20,808
Happy... Advocate Majid's niece? - No, she passed away. - I see.

199
00:14:21,308 --> 00:14:23,516
No need to blabber. Go call Guddu. - Guddu?

200
00:14:24,016 --> 00:14:24,475
Who's Guddu?

201
00:14:24,975 --> 00:14:26,433
Guddu... Our gardener's grandson Guddu.

202
00:14:26,933 --> 00:14:28,308
No-no, he's in jail. - Okay.

203
00:14:28,808 --> 00:14:31,016
Don't act smart! I'm trying to show some respect because you're old!

204
00:14:31,516 --> 00:14:33,058
Go and call Guddu. - Again with Guddu.

205
00:14:33,558 --> 00:14:34,141
What a stubborn girl!

206
00:14:34,641 --> 00:14:35,058
Who the hell is she?

207
00:14:35,558 --> 00:14:36,975
I said I am Happy. - So what do you want?

208
00:14:37,475 --> 00:14:38,850
I already said I want Guddu. Where is he?

209
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:41,350
He must be at his home, there is no Guddu here.

210
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:43,641
Control your attitude and talk respectfully.

211
00:14:44,141 --> 00:14:44,766
What were you doing inside that?

212
00:14:45,266 --> 00:14:47,100
I am not interested in talking to you.

213
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,600
I wonder what zoo you've brought me to.

214
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,808
Where's that bloody Winkle?

215
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,683
Wink... No, there's no Winkle.

216
00:14:54,183 --> 00:14:55,308
Who is this bloody Winkle now?

217
00:14:55,808 --> 00:14:56,933
First Guddu, now Winkle

218
00:14:57,433 --> 00:14:58,016
Are you crazy?

219
00:14:58,516 --> 00:15:00,891
Oh really?...so you don't know Winkle either.

220
00:15:01,391 --> 00:15:02,891
So who do you all work for?

221
00:15:03,391 --> 00:15:03,933
Who is your boss?

222
00:15:04,433 --> 00:15:06,141
Look, girl. If you say anything disrespectful for Mr. Senior...

223
00:15:06,641 --> 00:15:07,808
...then the consequences will be dire!

224
00:15:08,308 --> 00:15:10,141
Mr. Senior.

225
00:15:10,641 --> 00:15:12,433
Do-do you guys work for Bagga?

226
00:15:12,933 --> 00:15:15,308
Bagga! What Bagga?

227
00:15:15,808 --> 00:15:17,475
This is my...

228
00:15:17,975 --> 00:15:19,975
This is my father Javed Ahmed's house.

229
00:15:20,475 --> 00:15:21,933
This is the ex-Governor's home, idiot.

230
00:15:22,433 --> 00:15:23,975
Now shut your mouth and get out,

231
00:15:24,475 --> 00:15:25,683
I'm leaving, I'm leaving... Stupid fellow!

232
00:15:26,183 --> 00:15:27,141
Uncle, please get her out.

233
00:15:27,641 --> 00:15:28,475
Otherwise I will blow my cool.

234
00:15:28,975 --> 00:15:31,225
Come on. Come on. - God knows what madhouse of Lahore she's escaped from!

235
00:15:31,725 --> 00:15:33,725
I haven't escaped from one, I've come to one!

236
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:36,766
Come on. - *Mocks* God knows what madhouse of Lahore...

237
00:15:37,266 --> 00:15:39,808
Lahore...

238
00:15:40,308 --> 00:15:41,266
Lahore?

239
00:15:41,766 --> 00:15:43,850
Is she saying 'Lahol' or 'Lahore'?

240
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:46,308
Is...is this Lahore?

241
00:15:46,808 --> 00:15:49,891
What do you mean by Lahore?

242
00:15:50,391 --> 00:15:50,850
I...

243
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:54,016
I jumped in Winkle's truck...

244
00:15:54,516 --> 00:15:55,016
How?

245
00:15:55,516 --> 00:15:58,266
And that too Lahore?

246
00:15:58,766 --> 00:16:03,850
Are you an Indian? - Is-Is this Pakistan?

247
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:07,766
Curses.

248
00:16:08,266 --> 00:16:10,433
You came all the way from Amritsar to Lahore..

249
00:16:10,933 --> 00:16:11,933
..India to Pakistan, in a bride's outfit...

250
00:16:12,433 --> 00:16:13,183
Without a passport, or a visa...

251
00:16:13,683 --> 00:16:14,766
...and to Javed Ahmed's house.

252
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:17,100
Do you have any idea what you've done?

253
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,808
What have I done? - You...

254
00:16:20,308 --> 00:16:20,850
Sh**!

255
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:23,141
If we don't get her deported right now...

256
00:16:23,641 --> 00:16:24,641
...our lives will be ruined.

257
00:16:25,141 --> 00:16:27,100
Just Give me your mobile once... - Leave me!

258
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,225
What are you doing?

259
00:16:28,725 --> 00:16:30,100
If I get deported they will hand me over to father.

260
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,308
And he'll get me married to Bagga...

261
00:16:31,808 --> 00:16:33,891
I don't want to get deported!

262
00:16:34,391 --> 00:16:35,433
You don't want to?

263
00:16:35,933 --> 00:16:37,516
How does it matter what you want?

264
00:16:38,016 --> 00:16:39,225
Madam, this is Pakistan.

265
00:16:39,725 --> 00:16:41,016
If my father finds out about this...

266
00:16:41,516 --> 00:16:42,975
...then he'll turn this house into a graveyard for me...

267
00:16:43,475 --> 00:16:45,891
...this healthy woman and this helpless man.

268
00:16:46,391 --> 00:16:48,100
You will go back to India right now.

269
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,516
Look, give me your mobile.

270
00:16:50,016 --> 00:16:51,225
I want to talk to Guddu. - What...

271
00:16:51,725 --> 00:16:52,808
You uncivilized...

272
00:16:53,308 --> 00:16:54,266
Stop trying to snatch my mobile. - Phone.

273
00:16:54,766 --> 00:16:59,308
Auntie, just control her please.

274
00:16:59,808 --> 00:17:00,058
Come here...

275
00:17:00,558 --> 00:17:04,516
Go and lock her in the room! - Leave me!

276
00:17:05,016 --> 00:17:08,058
Sir, look it's the same Kareena Kaif design.

277
00:17:08,558 --> 00:17:10,308
Oh just take her away, auntie. - Okay.

278
00:17:10,808 --> 00:17:12,058
Come on. - Mr. Junior...

279
00:17:12,558 --> 00:17:13,766
if Mr. Senior gets a whiff of this...

280
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:15,100
...then we'll be in big trouble.

281
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,141
Thank you very much for your advice, uncle.

282
00:17:17,641 --> 00:17:20,308
I'll be really grateful if you shut that woman up.

283
00:17:20,808 --> 00:17:24,308
Will you shut up?

284
00:17:28,475 --> 00:17:30,350
Mr. Junior!

285
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:32,766
Lady! Get back here

286
00:17:33,266 --> 00:17:35,058
Hey...Indian!

287
00:17:35,558 --> 00:17:36,350
Stop!

288
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:38,225
You couldn't control one girl...

289
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:39,350
What's the point of all this physique?

290
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:42,808
But I just... - Your obsession for the necklace will be the end of you.

291
00:17:43,308 --> 00:17:44,475
Let's go. - I didn't ask for it right now.

292
00:17:44,975 --> 00:17:45,891
She's roaming the streets of Lahore...

293
00:17:46,391 --> 00:17:49,891
...and she knows the names of Mr. Junior and Senior both.

294
00:17:59,558 --> 00:18:00,891
You never apologise for your mistakes

295
00:18:01,391 --> 00:18:02,183
Please be quiet. - Yes, father.

296
00:18:02,683 --> 00:18:04,933
Zoya is your fiance. - Yes. Yes, father.

297
00:18:05,433 --> 00:18:06,475
Then why aren't you attending her calls?

298
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:08,516
She's Zia Rehmani's daughter.

299
00:18:09,016 --> 00:18:11,725
Do you know this marriage will change the history of Pakistan?

300
00:18:12,225 --> 00:18:15,725
Call her immediately. - Yes. Yes, father.

301
00:18:29,558 --> 00:18:31,266
There's no sign of Happy

302
00:18:31,766 --> 00:18:34,933
Come Winkle, let's go and tell Happy's father everything.

303
00:18:35,433 --> 00:18:37,308
What? Tell him what?

304
00:18:37,808 --> 00:18:40,266
"Hello father...we tried to run off with your daughter..."

305
00:18:40,766 --> 00:18:41,766
"...but we failed."

306
00:18:42,266 --> 00:18:43,683
Everyone's thirsty for our blood out there.

307
00:18:44,183 --> 00:18:45,850
And you're making plans of getting killed?

308
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:48,641
Even if I get killed today, father must know the truth.

309
00:18:49,141 --> 00:18:50,350
Happy could be in some kind of trouble.

310
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:51,350
Go on.

311
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:54,975
Someone will have to arrange for your final rites after you're dead,

312
00:18:55,475 --> 00:18:58,975
I will make those arrangements. I swear.

313
00:19:01,183 --> 00:19:03,516
Stop-stop-stop. - But you asked me to take you to the market.

314
00:19:04,016 --> 00:19:05,058
Come on, stop.

315
00:19:05,558 --> 00:19:06,808
How much? - I'm going to charge you the entire fare.

316
00:19:07,308 --> 00:19:09,391
30 rupees. - Here.

317
00:19:09,891 --> 00:19:12,391
Gandhiji...in Lahore. - Adjust for now.

318
00:19:12,891 --> 00:19:17,933
Pay me with Pakistani notes, and let me go.

319
00:19:18,433 --> 00:19:20,016
Take this...and give me some Pakistani notes.

320
00:19:20,516 --> 00:19:21,516
What will I do with this fake bracelet?

321
00:19:22,016 --> 00:19:22,766
I want my 30 rupees.

322
00:19:23,266 --> 00:19:24,808
I am giving you gold practically free...and you're showing attitude.

323
00:19:25,308 --> 00:19:26,933
Are you giving? Or should I make a scene?

324
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:29,058
Give me my fare. - Fine, don't give me any notes.

325
00:19:29,558 --> 00:19:30,308
Get lost. - Not so easily.

326
00:19:30,808 --> 00:19:32,350
I am already in a bad mood.

327
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:34,975
Don't mess with me - I'm going to leave with my fare.

328
00:19:35,475 --> 00:19:37,516
Everyone is getting on my nerves since this morning.

329
00:19:38,016 --> 00:19:39,016
Move aside or else I will slap you.

330
00:19:39,516 --> 00:19:41,808
Hand me my money quietly

331
00:19:42,308 --> 00:19:42,391
What's the problem?

332
00:19:42,891 --> 00:19:44,725
Sir, she isn't paying the rickshaw fare...

333
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:48,600
...and asking me for money instead.

334
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:53,516
Hold on...show me those notes.

335
00:19:54,016 --> 00:19:55,683
Ahh Mahatma Gandhi!

336
00:19:56,183 --> 00:19:58,641
I wish Mahatma Gandhi was in Pakistan!

337
00:19:59,141 --> 00:20:04,058
This isn't mine, it belongs to him. - She's such a liar!

338
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:08,850
Wait a minute...these Indians think we Pakistanis are stupid.

339
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:12,058
You've been sent here by some new technique of spying, right.

340
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:14,808
Sir, I am Pakistani. I live close-by. Really close-by.

341
00:20:15,308 --> 00:20:17,850
Where? - In the lanes of Ballimara.

342
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:19,641
Balli...

343
00:20:20,141 --> 00:20:20,933
Ballimara?

344
00:20:21,433 --> 00:20:23,433
Sounds familiar.

345
00:20:23,933 --> 00:20:25,475
Exactly...it's in Lahore.

346
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:27,975
Aah hah...it's not in Lahore. It's in Delhi.

347
00:20:28,475 --> 00:20:31,016
It's Mirza Ghalib's neighborhood.

348
00:20:31,516 --> 00:20:33,350
I wish Mirza Ghalib was in Pakistan as well.

349
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:36,058
Sir, we have Illama Iqbal. - Who?

350
00:20:36,558 --> 00:20:38,975
Illama Iqbal. - Yes, of course.

351
00:20:39,475 --> 00:20:41,016
You see, lady...you're giving me a great opportunity...

352
00:20:41,516 --> 00:20:43,933
...to fulfill the biggest dream of my life.

353
00:20:44,433 --> 00:20:47,266
My desire to catch an Indian spy is finally complete.

354
00:20:47,766 --> 00:20:50,016
Alhumdulillah! -Alhumdulillah!

355
00:20:50,516 --> 00:20:51,641
Amjad. - Sir.

356
00:20:52,141 --> 00:20:53,391
Make the spy sit in the car. - Yes Sir.

357
00:20:53,891 --> 00:20:57,391
Hey...

358
00:20:59,016 --> 00:21:00,725
Usman Afridi...

359
00:21:01,225 --> 00:21:01,891
Shahid Afridi's uncle huh?

360
00:21:02,391 --> 00:21:04,641
Do you know who you are arresting?

361
00:21:05,141 --> 00:21:07,600
I am the guest of Lahore's most respected family.

362
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,850
Javed Ahmed...ex-Governor.

363
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:12,891
Have you heard his name?

364
00:21:13,391 --> 00:21:15,100
So...are you Mr. Senior's...

365
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,058
No, Junior. I am his son's guest.

366
00:21:18,558 --> 00:21:21,683
The special kind.

367
00:21:22,183 --> 00:21:23,058
Amjad. - Sir.

368
00:21:23,558 --> 00:21:28,433
Please ask the spy to respectfully get in the jeep. - Sir.

369
00:21:28,933 --> 00:21:30,933
Please come. Sit

370
00:21:31,433 --> 00:21:33,058
Do you have a mobile phone?

371
00:21:33,558 --> 00:21:34,516
Brother, should I get Kartar's boys too?

372
00:21:35,016 --> 00:21:35,475
Brother, Guddu.

373
00:21:35,975 --> 00:21:36,891
Guddu.

374
00:21:37,391 --> 00:21:37,808
Catch him.

375
00:21:38,308 --> 00:21:39,141
Where's sister-in-law Happy?

376
00:21:39,641 --> 00:21:41,725
Where's Happy?

377
00:21:42,225 --> 00:21:43,225
Where is she? We're asking you!

378
00:21:43,725 --> 00:21:47,225
Get lost. You bloody....

379
00:21:55,266 --> 00:21:56,516
Where is my Happy?

380
00:21:57,016 --> 00:21:58,308
Father, I've been looking all over for her myself

381
00:21:58,808 --> 00:22:01,266
How dare you lie you swine? You lying swine!

382
00:22:01,766 --> 00:22:04,391
I swear on Happy, she is not with me.

383
00:22:04,891 --> 00:22:08,391
Honestly, father.

384
00:22:14,558 --> 00:22:18,100
So she isn't with you? - No.

385
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,183
Now...this is a new problem.

386
00:22:21,683 --> 00:22:23,766
This is the highlight.

387
00:22:24,266 --> 00:22:27,433
She was supposed to marry me...elope with him...

388
00:22:27,933 --> 00:22:29,391
...but she fled with someone else.

389
00:22:29,891 --> 00:22:30,308
Wow!

390
00:22:30,808 --> 00:22:34,100
Your Happy's quite a character... - Bagga. Mind your language!

391
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,100
I should mind my language?

392
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,141
For Gods sake shut up. - I should shut up?

393
00:22:39,641 --> 00:22:41,391
All the cards had been distributed.

394
00:22:41,891 --> 00:22:43,141
You must give your word in everyone's presence...

395
00:22:43,641 --> 00:22:47,141
...whenever you find Happy... you will get her married to me.

396
00:22:53,308 --> 00:22:55,725
What?

397
00:22:56,225 --> 00:22:57,891
Happy will marry me, Bagga.

398
00:22:58,391 --> 00:22:59,100
And in front of you.

399
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,016
You fool, you'll see Happy when someone sees you.

400
00:23:03,516 --> 00:23:04,433
Put a curfew on him.

401
00:23:04,933 --> 00:23:08,850
Take his mobile!

402
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:12,225
Happy isn't going to be anyone's.

403
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:18,391
The day I find her, I will kill her!

404
00:23:18,891 --> 00:23:19,766
Hey...Afridi!

405
00:23:20,266 --> 00:23:21,433
You will deeply regret this.

406
00:23:21,933 --> 00:23:23,516
If you don't give me a phone right now to make a call...

407
00:23:24,016 --> 00:23:26,391
...I'll have Mr. Junior strip you of your uniform...

408
00:23:26,891 --> 00:23:30,016
...and blow balloons at the children's park, or my name isn't Happy.

409
00:23:30,516 --> 00:23:31,350
This is my last warning to you.

410
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:33,058
Let me make one call to India...

411
00:23:33,558 --> 00:23:37,058
...or else I will have you thrown out of Lahore!

412
00:23:40,766 --> 00:23:44,058
You have no idea how much Mr. Junior respects me.

413
00:23:44,558 --> 00:23:46,266
He practically dances to my tunes.

414
00:23:46,766 --> 00:23:48,100
I'll give you one more chance to obey!

415
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,225
Otherwise I'll get you transferred to Kabul.

416
00:23:51,725 --> 00:23:52,766
Amidst all the Talibanis!

417
00:23:53,266 --> 00:23:56,766
And you...

418
00:23:57,641 --> 00:23:58,433
Come.

419
00:23:58,933 --> 00:24:00,766
Look, just let me... - Come on.

420
00:24:01,266 --> 00:24:02,100
Make her sit in the car.

421
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,516
And take some more people with you, she runs away.

422
00:24:05,016 --> 00:24:06,725
Leave me.

423
00:24:07,225 --> 00:24:07,683
Curses

424
00:24:08,183 --> 00:24:09,433
Mr. Junior.

425
00:24:09,933 --> 00:24:11,100
What is this Indian bud that you're..

426
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,391
..trying to grow on Lahore's soil?

427
00:24:13,891 --> 00:24:15,225
Afridi, she is a mistake!

428
00:24:15,725 --> 00:24:17,308
And she can ruin father's reputation.

429
00:24:17,808 --> 00:24:21,308
If this leaks out, then we'll be humiliated Internationally!

430
00:24:47,016 --> 00:24:48,100
First you ran away from your home...

431
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,475
...then you ran away from my home.

432
00:24:49,975 --> 00:24:52,350
Do you even think before doing anything? - No.

433
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:55,266
I want a phone.

434
00:24:55,766 --> 00:24:58,016
Are you not even a little tensed that you are in Pakistan?

435
00:24:58,516 --> 00:25:03,225
Pakistan should be tensed, not me!

436
00:25:03,725 --> 00:25:05,391
You've a screw loose, you know that?

437
00:25:05,891 --> 00:25:07,683
Anyways, you'll be sent to India right now.

438
00:25:08,183 --> 00:25:09,475
Bull sh** you cannot send me back.

439
00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:11,141
I am sending you back.

440
00:25:11,641 --> 00:25:12,475
The deportation guys will come and take you with them...

441
00:25:12,975 --> 00:25:13,725
Don't even think about it.

442
00:25:14,225 --> 00:25:17,725
I know...how well reputed your family is.

443
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:20,891
And how helpless it can be because of me.

444
00:25:21,391 --> 00:25:25,141
I'll tell the media... that Javed Ahmed and Bilal Ahmed...

445
00:25:25,641 --> 00:25:28,475
...brings girls here from India without passport or visa.

446
00:25:28,975 --> 00:25:32,266
And they make them... do God knows what.

447
00:25:32,766 --> 00:25:34,725
I want to send you back home respectfully...

448
00:25:35,225 --> 00:25:37,350
...and you're threatening to ruin my reputation.

449
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:40,475
Yes.

450
00:25:40,975 --> 00:25:44,475
I can't believe my ears.

451
00:25:48,225 --> 00:25:51,058
I can't believe my eyes!

452
00:25:51,558 --> 00:25:52,225
Quietly handover your phone.

453
00:25:52,725 --> 00:25:56,225
Hand it over or... - Just shut up, okay.

454
00:26:02,433 --> 00:26:03,308
Was that Bilal's car?

455
00:26:03,808 --> 00:26:04,350
What are you doing?

456
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:06,516
Follow him.

457
00:26:07,016 --> 00:26:08,141
Wagah?

458
00:26:08,641 --> 00:26:09,600
I won't go to Amritsar. Stop the car.

459
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:10,891
This won't car stop now.

460
00:26:11,391 --> 00:26:12,933
Stop the car. Have you lost your mind?

461
00:26:13,433 --> 00:26:15,100
Do you know whose car is that? - Whose?

462
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,141
Zoya's. - So?

463
00:26:17,641 --> 00:26:19,975
She's my fiance.

464
00:26:20,475 --> 00:26:23,100
A grown man afraid of his fianc?

465
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,808
Stop the car and I'll talk to her.

466
00:26:26,308 --> 00:26:28,100
You'll talk to her? Who are you?

467
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:28,975
Happy!

468
00:26:29,475 --> 00:26:30,266
Oh...no!

469
00:26:30,766 --> 00:26:34,266
Damn it!

470
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:42,475
Come out, Bilal. - Zo...

471
00:26:42,975 --> 00:26:46,475
First come out.

472
00:26:53,808 --> 00:26:57,516
Why did you run after seeing me?

473
00:26:58,016 --> 00:26:59,308
And who is she?

474
00:26:59,808 --> 00:27:00,641
She...

475
00:27:01,141 --> 00:27:03,100
She is Happy. - I can see that she is.

476
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,683
But I am asking you her name.

477
00:27:05,183 --> 00:27:06,016
Her name is Happy.

478
00:27:06,516 --> 00:27:09,308
And what is Happy doing in the front seat of your car?

479
00:27:09,808 --> 00:27:12,808
What is she doing...

480
00:27:13,308 --> 00:27:17,100
Hey you...who are you?

481
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,350
What do you want?

482
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:22,350
Why are you wearing that wedding dress?

483
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:24,600
Should I have worn a night dress for my wedding?

484
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,266
What?

485
00:27:26,766 --> 00:27:27,933
Bilal...what is she saying?

486
00:27:28,433 --> 00:27:29,850
What are you saying?

487
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:31,516
Actually she is right.

488
00:27:32,016 --> 00:27:33,475
Hold on...let me explain to you.

489
00:27:33,975 --> 00:27:34,683
Just give me a minute, okay.

490
00:27:35,183 --> 00:27:36,016
How dare you? What is this..

491
00:27:36,516 --> 00:27:38,891
Get in the car, I'll explain everything.

492
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:42,891
Please.

493
00:27:46,391 --> 00:27:47,725
That front seat's mine.

494
00:27:48,225 --> 00:27:50,266
Get out and sit on the backseat.

495
00:27:50,766 --> 00:27:52,933
Now!

496
00:27:53,433 --> 00:27:54,766
You're marrying her?

497
00:27:55,266 --> 00:27:55,433
Take my advice...

498
00:27:55,933 --> 00:27:59,683
...and tie a big stone around your neck and jump in the river.

499
00:28:00,183 --> 00:28:04,183
Everything you told me is a lie.

500
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:05,975
I don't believe this nonsense.

501
00:28:06,475 --> 00:28:07,641
And Guddu!

502
00:28:08,141 --> 00:28:10,016
It must be one of your nicknames.

503
00:28:10,516 --> 00:28:12,100
You've known me since I was a kid...

504
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,808
...when did I ever have a nickname like Guddu?

505
00:28:14,308 --> 00:28:14,683
She is Happy.

506
00:28:15,183 --> 00:28:15,891
Guddu's Happy.

507
00:28:16,391 --> 00:28:18,975
Say something... why are you quiet now? Huh?

508
00:28:19,475 --> 00:28:21,141
I am stuck amongst a bunch of idiots!

509
00:28:21,641 --> 00:28:22,808
I've been asking for a phone call since morning.

510
00:28:23,308 --> 00:28:24,725
I would've spoken to Guddu by now.

511
00:28:25,225 --> 00:28:26,350
Correct.

512
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:27,641
I am such a fool

513
00:28:28,141 --> 00:28:29,308
Here...call your Guddu...

514
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:30,516
...and let her speak to him as well.

515
00:28:31,016 --> 00:28:33,225
Hold on, I am going to ask his name.

516
00:28:33,725 --> 00:28:37,225
Give that to me.

517
00:28:40,808 --> 00:28:44,308
Brother, 'Private Number' flashing on Guddu's cellphone?

518
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:48,391
Hello. - Am I speaking with Guddu?

519
00:28:48,891 --> 00:28:50,350
There's no Guddu here.

520
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:51,933
Who is that?

521
00:28:52,433 --> 00:28:53,308
Don't you know English?

522
00:28:53,808 --> 00:28:57,016
Me Daman Singh Bagga... Punjabi to English non-stop top speed.

523
00:28:57,516 --> 00:28:58,183
Who you be? What you want?

524
00:28:58,683 --> 00:29:00,683
Are you demented? You're Guddu, right?

525
00:29:01,183 --> 00:29:03,475
I already told you this is Bagga speaking,

526
00:29:03,975 --> 00:29:05,975
Who you be? - Angelina Jolie.

527
00:29:06,475 --> 00:29:07,100
Curse you...

528
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,808
Hang up!

529
00:29:09,308 --> 00:29:09,683
Stupid idiot!

530
00:29:10,183 --> 00:29:10,850
There is no Guddu!

531
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:13,350
Who was it, brother? - Some Jolly.

532
00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:14,391
Trying to flaunt her English.

533
00:29:14,891 --> 00:29:16,725
Did you hear your brother's English?

534
00:29:17,225 --> 00:29:17,516
There's no Guddu?

535
00:29:18,016 --> 00:29:19,391
There's no bloody Guddu.

536
00:29:19,891 --> 00:29:22,641
There's no bloody Guddu.

537
00:29:23,141 --> 00:29:23,725
Here he is!

538
00:29:24,225 --> 00:29:26,975
It's either Happy or Jolly...

539
00:29:27,475 --> 00:29:29,516
Wonder who else Guddu's been going around with?

540
00:29:30,016 --> 00:29:31,016
It's all because of his music.

541
00:29:31,516 --> 00:29:34,225
If you could play the guitar or something... - Then what?

542
00:29:34,725 --> 00:29:36,475
Should I quit politics?

543
00:29:36,975 --> 00:29:39,100
And become a musician? - Hold on! Hold on!

544
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,725
Who was on the phone? - Some Bagga.

545
00:29:42,225 --> 00:29:44,891
Bagga's the guy my father wanted me to marry.

546
00:29:45,391 --> 00:29:46,808
Now there's a Bagga in the story too.

547
00:29:47,308 --> 00:29:48,100
No-no-no-no...there's a Bagga.

548
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,141
There's a Bagga since morning.

549
00:29:49,641 --> 00:29:51,600
Good afternoon.

550
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:54,850
Hello, dad. - Hello, dear.

551
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:56,016
Who is this?

552
00:29:56,516 --> 00:30:00,058
She's Happy. - Happy? Who?

553
00:30:00,558 --> 00:30:03,183
Bilal...tell him.

554
00:30:03,683 --> 00:30:07,516
Uncle she's...my Happy cousin...

555
00:30:08,016 --> 00:30:09,725
I mean my cousin Happy.

556
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:11,766
Javed never mentioned anything about her.

557
00:30:12,266 --> 00:30:15,433
Happy dear...where do you live? - K-K-Karachi.

558
00:30:15,933 --> 00:30:16,725
She is from Karachi.

559
00:30:17,225 --> 00:30:22,350
To attend a wedding. - Very nice, Karachi.

560
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:25,350
So dear what's happening in Karachi these days?

561
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:28,016
She's a very homely kid, uncle...

562
00:30:28,516 --> 00:30:31,058
...she wouldn't know what's happening in...Karachi.

563
00:30:31,558 --> 00:30:35,600
Bilal...you're answering all the questions.

564
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,933
Let me here this cute girl's voice as well.

565
00:30:39,433 --> 00:30:39,975
She won't speak.

566
00:30:40,475 --> 00:30:43,058
She-she-she won't speak.

567
00:30:43,558 --> 00:30:44,183
Why?

568
00:30:44,683 --> 00:30:50,808
How can she speak? - She can't speak?

569
00:30:51,308 --> 00:30:54,933
I am sorry, is she...

570
00:30:55,433 --> 00:30:55,766
Just a minute...excuse me.

571
00:30:56,266 --> 00:30:59,475
Dear, look after Happy. Okay.

572
00:30:59,975 --> 00:31:00,975
Yes. Tell me.

573
00:31:01,475 --> 00:31:03,933
You've started lying so flawlessly.

574
00:31:04,433 --> 00:31:06,308
Tell me honestly, what's going on between you two?

575
00:31:06,808 --> 00:31:09,058
Why do you come back to that?

576
00:31:09,558 --> 00:31:10,891
Where else should I go?

577
00:31:11,391 --> 00:31:11,641
Come here.

578
00:31:12,141 --> 00:31:14,891
Think about solving this problem. - Am I a problem?

579
00:31:15,391 --> 00:31:16,516
Oh just...will you please shut up?

580
00:31:17,016 --> 00:31:18,433
Just shut up alright!

581
00:31:18,933 --> 00:31:22,350
My life is ruined ever since you popped out of that basket!

582
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:26,808
Zoya, even if I try to deport her... she'll blabber nonsense to the media.

583
00:31:27,308 --> 00:31:29,266
So just help me.

584
00:31:29,766 --> 00:31:31,058
There is only one solution.

585
00:31:31,558 --> 00:31:32,850
If there's actually some Guddu.

586
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:35,808
Then call him here, get these two married...

587
00:31:36,308 --> 00:31:37,225
...and deport them back together.

588
00:31:37,725 --> 00:31:39,266
Superb. Great idea! - Oh Shut up!

589
00:31:39,766 --> 00:31:41,350
Okay, please just shut up.

590
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:42,433
Zoya, have you gone mad?

591
00:31:42,933 --> 00:31:44,725
I already told you I've nothing to do with her.

592
00:31:45,225 --> 00:31:46,516
Let's assume that you don't.

593
00:31:47,016 --> 00:31:49,725
But the world will believe her, not you. Right?

594
00:31:50,225 --> 00:31:52,891
And let's say we forcefully deport her.

595
00:31:53,391 --> 00:31:54,100
Then once she's back home...

596
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:59,808
...she can tarnish Javed uncle's reputation, and our marriage, right?

597
00:32:00,308 --> 00:32:01,391
Right.

598
00:32:01,891 --> 00:32:03,725
And I won't let that happen.

599
00:32:04,225 --> 00:32:05,808
So? - So?

600
00:32:06,308 --> 00:32:08,891
So...

601
00:32:09,391 --> 00:32:10,141
How will Guddu get here?

602
00:32:10,641 --> 00:32:12,641
If this nuisance can come in a basket...

603
00:32:13,141 --> 00:32:14,266
...he can still catch a bus.

604
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:17,350
He even has a passport.

605
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:19,433
And where will this nuisance stay until then?

606
00:32:19,933 --> 00:32:22,141
She's your mute cousin, so keep her in your house.

607
00:32:22,641 --> 00:32:23,683
What?

608
00:32:24,183 --> 00:32:25,850
No...never.

609
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:28,683
She will stay in aunty Rifat's quarters.

610
00:32:29,183 --> 00:32:29,683
And you...

611
00:32:30,183 --> 00:32:32,350
Until I don't see your Guddu with my own eyes...

612
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:34,266
...I will keep my eyes on you.

613
00:32:34,766 --> 00:32:37,641
And...and on this Guddu. Get it?

614
00:32:38,141 --> 00:32:39,100
okay.

615
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:43,100
Zo...

616
00:33:09,558 --> 00:33:12,850
Did you see something? - You saw it too.

617
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:14,433
I've been seeing it since I was a kid.

618
00:33:14,933 --> 00:33:18,141
Mom often visits during her death anniversary

619
00:33:18,641 --> 00:33:20,100
Did you see her for the first time, papa?

620
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:23,725
No-no...I've seen her before.

621
00:33:24,225 --> 00:33:27,725
In fact I see her every year.

622
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,933
Rifat. - Yes.

623
00:34:44,433 --> 00:34:45,850
Listen.

624
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:48,933
Tell me something. - Yes?

625
00:34:49,433 --> 00:34:53,100
Have you ever seen Shaista's spirit in this house?

626
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,850
Seen her?

627
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:57,516
She was with me in the kitchen a while ago.

628
00:34:58,016 --> 00:34:59,725
This house was madam's abode.

629
00:35:00,225 --> 00:35:02,016
Where else will she be seen?

630
00:35:02,516 --> 00:35:04,058
In Amritsar?

631
00:35:04,558 --> 00:35:08,350
Didn't you see her? - Huh...you can go.

632
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:12,350
Goodbye. - Goodbye.

633
00:35:20,308 --> 00:35:23,225
What are you angry with me for Shaista?

634
00:35:23,725 --> 00:35:27,225
Even the servants of this house can see you, but not me...

635
00:35:31,808 --> 00:35:37,225
Oh sorry... I didn't know you were here.

636
00:35:37,725 --> 00:35:40,183
Oh, you're crying.

637
00:35:40,683 --> 00:35:43,850
I'll be downstairs.

638
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:47,850
It's okay...this is your home.

639
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,975
Isn't there anyone in your family...

640
00:36:11,475 --> 00:36:13,475
...who could help you speak with Guddu?

641
00:36:13,975 --> 00:36:16,516
I am thinking about father.

642
00:36:17,016 --> 00:36:20,516
Finally!

643
00:36:21,725 --> 00:36:24,391
I am sorry.

644
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:28,433
Isn't it too late to think about your father now?

645
00:36:28,933 --> 00:36:30,683
I should've been like you.

646
00:36:31,183 --> 00:36:34,683
For you, your father comes first.

647
00:36:41,933 --> 00:36:45,433
This time I made a really big mess.

648
00:36:47,683 --> 00:36:49,391
I guess you can deport me.

649
00:36:49,891 --> 00:36:54,683
And don't worry... I won't go to the media.

650
00:36:55,183 --> 00:36:58,891
It's a question of faith now.

651
00:36:59,391 --> 00:37:01,516
Happy...

652
00:37:02,016 --> 00:37:05,016
Let Guddu come, then I'll get you two deported together.

653
00:37:05,516 --> 00:37:06,100
I see.

654
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:10,100
And your father? - I'll think about father later.

655
00:37:18,766 --> 00:37:20,808
I've called 100 times and told about a 100 lies.

656
00:37:21,308 --> 00:37:24,183
But he didn't give the phone to Guddu even once.

657
00:37:24,683 --> 00:37:27,933
What is this Bagga? - He's a big rascal.

658
00:37:28,433 --> 00:37:31,100
He trapped father... with his cunning words.

659
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,225
He used to say I'll become an MLA in two years.

660
00:37:33,725 --> 00:37:37,683
Tell me something about Guddu. What does he do? - Nothing.

661
00:37:38,183 --> 00:37:40,100
There must be something. Some hobby, habit.

662
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,100
I am his hobby and habit.

663
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:46,100
I am serious Happy. - Me too...he does nothing.

664
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:49,891
If he did, wouldn't father let me marry him instead!

665
00:37:50,391 --> 00:37:52,516
He used to strum his six-string?

666
00:37:53,016 --> 00:37:55,308
What?

667
00:37:55,808 --> 00:37:57,225
Six-string!

668
00:37:57,725 --> 00:38:01,225
He even dropped out of college to pursue music.

669
00:38:05,766 --> 00:38:09,266
What happened?

670
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:16,600
Music's got magic, Happy.

671
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:20,641
And I'll use this magic to bring Guddu here.

672
00:38:21,141 --> 00:38:23,100
Bring him? What are you going to do?

673
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:26,475
Same thing that Christopher Columbus did.

674
00:38:26,975 --> 00:38:28,683
What?

675
00:38:29,183 --> 00:38:31,100
Search!

676
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,266
Father's leaving for China day after tomorrow.

677
00:38:33,766 --> 00:38:35,891
I'll personally go to Amritsar and find Guddu.

678
00:38:36,391 --> 00:38:39,933
Get these two married before he returns and send them back.

679
00:38:40,433 --> 00:38:42,933
Will you really go to Amritsar?

680
00:38:43,433 --> 00:38:45,641
I'll draw a map of Amritsar for you.

681
00:38:46,141 --> 00:38:47,100
I'll get it from Google.

682
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:50,100
You just note down all of Guddu's whereabouts for me.

683
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,516
I want to make a plan. - Okay.

684
00:38:52,016 --> 00:38:54,391
Because Christopher Columbus won't go alone.

685
00:38:54,891 --> 00:38:56,016
Who will go with you?

686
00:38:56,516 --> 00:39:00,016
Ibn-e-Batuta.

687
00:39:01,766 --> 00:39:04,016
Mr. Junior... you can take my head.

688
00:39:04,516 --> 00:39:06,891
I'll ask for that later Afridi, it's not necessary right now.

689
00:39:07,391 --> 00:39:10,475
Please don't give me such cruel orders of accompanying you to India.

690
00:39:10,975 --> 00:39:13,016
I've already told you that I won't go to that country...

691
00:39:13,516 --> 00:39:15,141
I won't go... - And yes, there's another thing.

692
00:39:15,641 --> 00:39:16,308
What was it? - Yes, I won't go...

693
00:39:16,808 --> 00:39:17,516
You will definitely go.

694
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:20,600
You don't understand, Mr. Junior.

695
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:25,141
Under no circumstance can I even taste Indian salt.

696
00:39:25,641 --> 00:39:27,516
You're so stupid, Afridi. - What?

697
00:39:28,016 --> 00:39:32,683
You, me and almost entire Pakistan's been eating Indian salt for decades.

698
00:39:33,183 --> 00:39:33,516
Huh!

699
00:39:34,016 --> 00:39:35,308
We've been importing salt from India.

700
00:39:35,808 --> 00:39:36,850
What do you have to say about that?

701
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:39,641
Oh, that way?

702
00:39:40,141 --> 00:39:43,641
How long has this been going on?

703
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:50,308
Oh my, Allah save you from evil eye.

704
00:39:50,808 --> 00:39:52,808
You must always dress like this.

705
00:39:53,308 --> 00:39:54,141
You look amazing!

706
00:39:54,641 --> 00:39:57,975
Yes...and father will strip these clothes off, along with my skin.

707
00:39:58,475 --> 00:40:01,433
I must always dress like this.

708
00:40:01,933 --> 00:40:03,891
I know I am troubling you.

709
00:40:04,391 --> 00:40:06,100
But I don't have a choice.

710
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:09,683
Stuffed bread...he loves them.

711
00:40:10,183 --> 00:40:13,683
My cooking I mean.

712
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,600
Yeah...that's it.

713
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:21,891
Yeah...

714
00:40:22,391 --> 00:40:23,516
Come on, Afridi. Come on.

715
00:40:24,016 --> 00:40:25,141
Come on, boy...you can do it.

716
00:40:25,641 --> 00:40:26,725
Take a step forward...

717
00:40:27,225 --> 00:40:29,225
If he doesn't get off just push him down.

718
00:40:29,725 --> 00:40:32,975
Who said that? - I did.

719
00:40:33,475 --> 00:40:34,016
Afridi, just let it be.

720
00:40:34,516 --> 00:40:36,058
Just come on, you can do it Afridi.

721
00:40:36,558 --> 00:40:36,808
One...

722
00:40:37,308 --> 00:40:38,350
Allah forgive me. - Two...

723
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:42,350
Allah-hu-Akbar. - three

724
00:40:53,141 --> 00:40:54,016
This is the Punjab that's given birth...

725
00:40:54,516 --> 00:40:57,850
...to cricketers like Kapil Dev and Yuvraaj.

726
00:40:58,350 --> 00:41:02,391
I wish Kapil Dev and Yuvraaj were in Pakistan.

727
00:41:02,891 --> 00:41:04,350
Why don't you leave Pakistan out sometimes?

728
00:41:04,850 --> 00:41:06,766
You did make me leave it.

729
00:41:07,266 --> 00:41:08,433
Curses.

730
00:41:08,933 --> 00:41:12,725
Okay...go ask them Guddu's address.

731
00:41:13,225 --> 00:41:14,850
Who? - Them?

732
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:18,433
In what language? - They are not Chinese.

733
00:41:18,933 --> 00:41:22,433
They understand Urdu. Go!

734
00:41:30,016 --> 00:41:31,350
Excuse me.

735
00:41:31,850 --> 00:41:33,766
I said excuse me.

736
00:41:34,266 --> 00:41:37,308
Does Guddu stay in this domicile?

737
00:41:37,808 --> 00:41:42,850
Who are you to ask?

738
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:44,516
Did you hear?

739
00:41:45,016 --> 00:41:46,266
You're too much, Afridi.

740
00:41:46,766 --> 00:41:49,225
Mister, can you tell me where I can find Guddu?

741
00:41:49,725 --> 00:41:53,225
Who the hell are you two?

742
00:41:56,558 --> 00:41:57,100
Rehan Lahori.

743
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:00,266
And my manager, Hairat Gul.

744
00:42:00,766 --> 00:42:04,266
Looks like they have captured a nursery school.

745
00:42:10,016 --> 00:42:15,766
I need to take this call, please keep your mouth shut till I'm back.

746
00:42:16,266 --> 00:42:16,516
Hello?

747
00:42:17,016 --> 00:42:17,308
Yes Zoya...

748
00:42:17,808 --> 00:42:23,475
When will Mr. Bagga come? - Shut up.

749
00:42:23,975 --> 00:42:25,725
Fell asleep accidentally.

750
00:42:26,225 --> 00:42:28,433
You know your brother doesn't sleep during the day.

751
00:42:28,933 --> 00:42:33,225
So you were getting some Kayloola?

752
00:42:33,725 --> 00:42:36,266
Your father is a Kayloola! - No no you misunderstand.

753
00:42:36,766 --> 00:42:40,766
In Urdu, Kayloola means taking a nap in the day.

754
00:42:41,266 --> 00:42:42,433
Who is he? Where did you find him?

755
00:42:42,933 --> 00:42:46,475
Boss, they're from a music company.

756
00:42:46,975 --> 00:42:50,766
Bajao Music Company... Lahore?

757
00:42:51,266 --> 00:42:52,808
You are from Pakistan?

758
00:42:53,308 --> 00:42:54,641
Tell me something Kayloola...

759
00:42:55,141 --> 00:42:59,766
What do you call music in Urdu?

760
00:43:00,266 --> 00:43:02,058
'Mausiqi'. - Son of a...

761
00:43:02,558 --> 00:43:03,100
How dare you abuse me?

762
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:04,683
You're misunderstanding again.

763
00:43:05,183 --> 00:43:05,475
I am not abusing you.

764
00:43:05,975 --> 00:43:07,433
You asked what music's called in Urdu.

765
00:43:07,933 --> 00:43:09,391
So...in Urdu it's called 'Mausiqi'.

766
00:43:09,891 --> 00:43:13,058
Say it... 'Mausiqi'.

767
00:43:13,558 --> 00:43:13,766
'Mausikee'.

768
00:43:14,266 --> 00:43:16,433
Not Ki...Qi, Mausiqi.

769
00:43:16,933 --> 00:43:18,225
Has a dot above 'Qi'.

770
00:43:18,725 --> 00:43:19,308
Now what the hell is that?

771
00:43:19,808 --> 00:43:20,975
Boss... Apply a dot...

772
00:43:21,475 --> 00:43:22,141
He's asking to apply the dot...Like on the forehead

773
00:43:22,641 --> 00:43:24,516
You idiot am I a girl to be doing that?

774
00:43:25,016 --> 00:43:25,183
Who is he?

775
00:43:25,683 --> 00:43:27,391
Forget him, he's just the manager.

776
00:43:27,891 --> 00:43:28,266
Just the manager.

777
00:43:28,766 --> 00:43:29,683
You said he owns a music company.

778
00:43:30,183 --> 00:43:31,225
Of course, I own a music company.

779
00:43:31,725 --> 00:43:33,016
Sorry, I was busy on a phone call.

780
00:43:33,516 --> 00:43:36,725
Are you Bagga?

781
00:43:37,225 --> 00:43:39,600
Daman Singh Bagga! What do you want?

782
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:41,933
I've business with Guddu, not Bagga.

783
00:43:42,433 --> 00:43:42,891
Where's Guddu?

784
00:43:43,391 --> 00:43:46,100
No one's got any business with Guddu in India.

785
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:50,725
What business do you Pakistanis have with him?

786
00:43:51,225 --> 00:43:54,725
What business?

787
00:43:57,433 --> 00:44:02,891
Well...have you ever heard Guddu's voice?

788
00:44:03,391 --> 00:44:04,016
Why?

789
00:44:04,516 --> 00:44:07,266
He's...amazing, bro.

790
00:44:07,766 --> 00:44:09,433
We'll make him sing... in Lahore.

791
00:44:09,933 --> 00:44:11,100
Where did you hear Guddu's voice?

792
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:15,641
Bro...Youtube. - Youtube

793
00:44:16,141 --> 00:44:20,100
So much talented

794
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:24,725
No wonder Happy fell for him.

795
00:44:25,225 --> 00:44:27,016
Who's Happy?

796
00:44:27,516 --> 00:44:29,225
The one your brother was supposed to marry.

797
00:44:29,725 --> 00:44:31,850
My brother? But I am the only son to my parents.

798
00:44:32,350 --> 00:44:34,725
The cards were distributed.

799
00:44:35,225 --> 00:44:36,808
And on the wedding night... - What happened?

800
00:44:37,308 --> 00:44:39,516
She ran away. - With whom?

801
00:44:40,016 --> 00:44:41,641
She was supposed to run away with that bloody Guddu.

802
00:44:42,141 --> 00:44:45,641
But who knows which idiot she ran away with.

803
00:44:49,433 --> 00:44:50,891
Here's your Justin Bieber...

804
00:44:51,391 --> 00:44:52,308
Guddu, my bro.

805
00:44:52,808 --> 00:44:54,850
Guddu! Guddu! Guddu!

806
00:44:55,350 --> 00:44:57,641
Come...I want to take you to your dreamland.

807
00:44:58,141 --> 00:44:59,433
O music shop...

808
00:44:59,933 --> 00:45:00,808
Give him whatever you want to right here.

809
00:45:01,308 --> 00:45:04,808
Guddu won't go anywhere alone.

810
00:45:07,683 --> 00:45:09,516
Wo...wow, Bagga Sir.

811
00:45:10,016 --> 00:45:10,475
This is amazing.

812
00:45:10,975 --> 00:45:15,016
We'll have to tell him whatever it is, in front of you.

813
00:45:15,516 --> 00:45:16,391
Guddu won't go anywhere.

814
00:45:16,891 --> 00:45:17,891
So how are we going to tell him?

815
00:45:18,391 --> 00:45:20,308
Who are you? What do you want?

816
00:45:20,808 --> 00:45:23,308
They want to make you sing...that too in Lahore.

817
00:45:23,808 --> 00:45:26,433
Look, I am not going anywhere to sing.

818
00:45:26,933 --> 00:45:29,808
There you go Kayloola...it's decided. Dimpy, throw them out

819
00:45:30,308 --> 00:45:34,100
No no no...Stop that nonsense Bagga.

820
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:37,808
Sorry... Look...

821
00:45:38,308 --> 00:45:40,433
I came all the way from Lahore to Amritsar for your benefit.

822
00:45:40,933 --> 00:45:43,350
And you want to throw me out?

823
00:45:43,850 --> 00:45:48,183
Benefit? What benefit?

824
00:45:48,683 --> 00:45:50,683
He'll go there...sing for us... - Yeah.

825
00:45:51,183 --> 00:45:53,100
I'll make a living... and you'll get your wedding.

826
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:55,058
Yeah.

827
00:45:55,558 --> 00:45:59,225
You were saying that some Happy...ran away.

828
00:45:59,725 --> 00:46:00,683
And you doubt him.

829
00:46:01,183 --> 00:46:02,475
Now when he will no longer be here...

830
00:46:02,975 --> 00:46:07,225
...then whose arms will Happy fall in?

831
00:46:07,725 --> 00:46:10,266
Bagga's!

832
00:46:10,766 --> 00:46:13,891
How's your brother's plan?

833
00:46:14,391 --> 00:46:16,641
Take him, take him...

834
00:46:17,141 --> 00:46:19,433
So it's decided... prepare to leave.

835
00:46:19,933 --> 00:46:21,975
My manager Hairat Gul will make all the arrangements.

836
00:46:22,475 --> 00:46:24,641
Right, Hairat?

837
00:46:25,141 --> 00:46:26,183
Hairat Gul!

838
00:46:26,683 --> 00:46:28,350
Go he's calling you.

839
00:46:28,850 --> 00:46:31,600
Yeah...yes yes... Rehan Lahori, of course.

840
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:33,100
I already told you I won't go to Lahore.

841
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,225
And your tricks won't work on me, Bagga.

842
00:46:35,725 --> 00:46:36,850
And I won't go with these hired goons.

843
00:46:37,350 --> 00:46:39,266
Hired goons? - Son, try to understand.

844
00:46:39,766 --> 00:46:40,850
He's come all the way from Lahore only for you.

845
00:46:41,350 --> 00:46:42,975
And we're not hired, we're original.

846
00:46:43,475 --> 00:46:44,141
We'll take you to your love.

847
00:46:44,641 --> 00:46:45,475
His love for 'Mausiqi' (Music).

848
00:46:45,975 --> 00:46:47,850
Yeah...you wont even go for the love of Mausiki?

849
00:46:48,350 --> 00:46:49,141
Happy's love is all I need.

850
00:46:49,641 --> 00:46:50,100
And you can keep your Mausiki.

851
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:54,016
Listen, his, mine, whosever love it is... you'll only find it in Lahore.

852
00:46:54,516 --> 00:46:57,266
Yeah... Look, son...he'll get in big trouble otherwise, and me too.

853
00:46:57,766 --> 00:46:58,600
To hell with both of you.

854
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:00,100
It's because of people like you...

855
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:02,391
...that India and Pakistan could never be friends.

856
00:47:02,891 --> 00:47:03,475
Go with them, come on.

857
00:47:03,975 --> 00:47:05,433
I've given my word. - He's given his word.

858
00:47:05,933 --> 00:47:08,100
Try to understand brother, It's all in Lahore

859
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:10,850
Who is? - Happening... It's Happening.

860
00:47:11,350 --> 00:47:12,975
Think of your dream, Guddu....

861
00:47:13,475 --> 00:47:16,100
One that's in the depths of your dreams, you'll find it there.

862
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:18,058
One that's in the loneliness of your heart, you'll find it there.

863
00:47:18,558 --> 00:47:20,683
One that's in your destiny, you'll find it there.

864
00:47:21,183 --> 00:47:23,600
Yeah... - At least listen to him!

865
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:25,308
Otherwise I swear I will eat poison.

866
00:47:25,808 --> 00:47:30,350
And not just him, I will eat it too...and make you eat it.

867
00:47:30,850 --> 00:47:31,058
Eat!

868
00:47:31,558 --> 00:47:34,141
Two Pakistanis will die in my backyard because of you...

869
00:47:34,641 --> 00:47:35,225
...my ticket will get cancelled.

870
00:47:35,725 --> 00:47:37,933
And if that happens, forget Happy I won't let you marry anyone.

871
00:47:38,433 --> 00:47:40,100
Bagga bro, don't get emotional.

872
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:44,141
Please...don't get emotional, Bagga.

873
00:47:44,641 --> 00:47:46,600
Okay.

874
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:50,683
Guddu, you don't want to come with us, don't come.

875
00:47:51,183 --> 00:47:55,100
You don't want to sing for us, don't sing.

876
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:57,933
But we're fans of your music.

877
00:47:58,433 --> 00:48:01,225
At least eat a bite from our hands.

878
00:48:01,725 --> 00:48:02,391
No... - Please. - I won't eat it.

879
00:48:02,891 --> 00:48:03,308
It's stuffed bread.

880
00:48:03,808 --> 00:48:04,933
Why won't you eat it? - Stay away.

881
00:48:05,433 --> 00:48:07,266
Bagga bro, he's humiliated us a lot.

882
00:48:07,766 --> 00:48:08,808
If he doesn't eat, how will he go?

883
00:48:09,308 --> 00:48:09,808
Please give us a hand.

884
00:48:10,308 --> 00:48:10,725
Dimpy, lay him down.

885
00:48:11,225 --> 00:48:12,641
Hey... - You...

886
00:48:13,141 --> 00:48:14,266
Stay away! Stay away! Stay away!

887
00:48:14,766 --> 00:48:15,808
Careful...make him sit, please..

888
00:48:16,308 --> 00:48:18,141
We brought it especially for you from Lahore.

889
00:48:18,641 --> 00:48:19,975
If only you had eaten it politely...you would've understood.

890
00:48:20,475 --> 00:48:23,016
But I guess I'll have to shove this love down your throat. - Yes yes, shove it down.

891
00:48:23,516 --> 00:48:25,100
Will you only make wise cracks or start shoving also?

892
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:27,058
Or else give that to your Brother, I'll do it for you.

893
00:48:27,558 --> 00:48:28,308
Yeah...Lahori, give it to him.

894
00:48:28,808 --> 00:48:30,183
Do it, brother!

895
00:48:30,683 --> 00:48:32,183
Come on... - Open your mouth.

896
00:48:32,683 --> 00:48:34,808
Open your mouth.

897
00:48:35,308 --> 00:48:37,725
Great.

898
00:48:38,225 --> 00:48:39,433
Eat it.

899
00:48:39,933 --> 00:48:41,016
More...

900
00:48:41,516 --> 00:48:43,058
More, brother!

901
00:48:43,558 --> 00:48:44,850
Will you sing now?

902
00:48:45,350 --> 00:48:46,725
Will you go to Lahore now?

903
00:48:47,225 --> 00:48:48,141
Fantastic.

904
00:48:48,641 --> 00:48:49,308
Bagga bro...that's enough.

905
00:48:49,808 --> 00:48:51,516
Eat some more... Go to Lahore.

906
00:48:52,016 --> 00:48:54,183
Bagga Bro...Stop it!

907
00:48:54,683 --> 00:48:55,808
It's done.

908
00:48:56,308 --> 00:48:58,225
You're simply amazing, Bagga bro.

909
00:48:58,725 --> 00:49:00,391
The boy's said yes. - He did?

910
00:49:00,891 --> 00:49:03,766
Hairat, take care of Guddu's visa and other formalities.

911
00:49:04,266 --> 00:49:05,141
And bring him to Lahore respectfully.

912
00:49:05,641 --> 00:49:06,683
Oh yes, of course of course

913
00:49:07,183 --> 00:49:11,516
Bagga...brother...I am touched by your gestures of help

914
00:49:12,016 --> 00:49:13,641
Touched. - You're welcome.

915
00:49:14,141 --> 00:49:18,100
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Everyone! - Thank you. - Yes, Goodbye

916
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:23,308
Boss...these Pakistanis have so much love in them?

917
00:49:23,808 --> 00:49:25,308
I was thinking that too.

918
00:49:25,808 --> 00:49:29,308
Keep an eye on Guddu. Come on. - Okay, brother.

919
00:49:35,016 --> 00:49:38,516
Is this Bagga's minion always watching you?

920
00:49:42,475 --> 00:49:45,183
Tell me something...

921
00:49:45,683 --> 00:49:48,725
I've met Happy... she's quite feisty.

922
00:49:49,225 --> 00:49:52,766
She has all of Pakistan dancing to her beats in two days.

923
00:49:53,266 --> 00:49:55,350
You look like a decent boy.

924
00:49:55,850 --> 00:49:59,350
What was your need to run away with her?

925
00:50:06,225 --> 00:50:07,058
Just two months...

926
00:50:07,558 --> 00:50:09,433
I'll get my contract from the music company.

927
00:50:09,933 --> 00:50:11,183
The contract will come when it comes

928
00:50:11,683 --> 00:50:13,600
But I'll have to get married as soon as I graduate.

929
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:16,016
For sure

930
00:50:16,516 --> 00:50:19,808
Reeto's here...see you later.

931
00:50:20,308 --> 00:50:25,308
You'll get married... and you'll be marrying me.

932
00:50:25,808 --> 00:50:29,308
For sure

933
00:50:30,475 --> 00:50:33,100
"Darling... My darling."

934
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:36,850
"It's the season of love."

935
00:50:37,350 --> 00:50:39,933
"Darling... My darling."

936
00:50:40,433 --> 00:50:43,141
"You're with me in every step I take."

937
00:50:43,641 --> 00:50:46,391
"You're the melody from my musical instrument."

938
00:50:46,891 --> 00:50:48,391
"You're the melody..."

939
00:50:48,891 --> 00:50:50,100
"You're the melody..."

940
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:53,641
"You're the engravings on my soul."

941
00:50:54,141 --> 00:50:55,266
"Yes, it's you."

942
00:50:55,766 --> 00:50:56,975
"It's you."

943
00:50:57,475 --> 00:51:00,266
"You're my life."

944
00:51:00,766 --> 00:51:03,725
"I've put my faith in you."

945
00:51:04,225 --> 00:51:07,266
"God dwells in you."

946
00:51:07,766 --> 00:51:11,100
"It's like my heart's connected with God."

947
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:14,100
"Darling... My darling."

948
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:17,475
"You're with me in every step I take."

949
00:51:17,975 --> 00:51:19,141
"You're the melody..."

950
00:51:19,641 --> 00:51:20,975
"You're the melody..."

951
00:51:21,475 --> 00:51:22,641
"You're the melody..."

952
00:51:23,141 --> 00:51:24,391
"You're the melody..."

953
00:51:24,891 --> 00:51:26,100
"Yes, it's you."

954
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:27,891
"It's you."

955
00:51:28,391 --> 00:51:29,641
"Yes, it's you."

956
00:51:30,141 --> 00:51:33,641
"It's you."

957
00:51:58,850 --> 00:52:06,725
"I kept fighting with my dreams."

958
00:52:07,225 --> 00:52:12,391
"I was always afraid to say it."

959
00:52:12,891 --> 00:52:19,225
"My only wish was for you to be mine."

960
00:52:19,725 --> 00:52:26,225
"I think God answers my prayers as well."

961
00:52:26,725 --> 00:52:29,516
"You're my peace, my obsession."

962
00:52:30,016 --> 00:52:33,016
"You're my desire, my hope."

963
00:52:33,516 --> 00:52:36,391
"You're my craving, and my serenity."

964
00:52:36,891 --> 00:52:40,183
"You're the pain and the relief."

965
00:52:40,683 --> 00:52:42,600
You kept saying we'll get married.

966
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:45,933
Here...I am getting married.

967
00:52:46,433 --> 00:52:47,600
Stuff your face...

968
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:50,641
"Darling... My darling."

969
00:52:51,141 --> 00:52:54,308
"It's the season of love."

970
00:52:54,808 --> 00:52:57,350
"Darling... My darling."

971
00:52:57,850 --> 00:53:01,350
"You're with me in every step I take."

972
00:53:26,433 --> 00:53:32,808
"I spend one day... and you spend a night."

973
00:53:33,308 --> 00:53:39,516
"In this love... we've shared many centuries."

974
00:53:40,016 --> 00:53:46,516
"If we ever separate, the world will say..."

975
00:53:47,016 --> 00:53:52,641
"You're the song that's sung only by me."

976
00:53:53,141 --> 00:53:55,766
"Darling... My darling."

977
00:53:56,266 --> 00:53:59,475
"It's the season of love."

978
00:53:59,975 --> 00:54:02,475
"Darling... My darling."

979
00:54:02,975 --> 00:54:05,766
"You're with me in every step I take."

980
00:54:06,266 --> 00:54:10,308
What is it? Why have you come here?

981
00:54:10,808 --> 00:54:11,850
This is all you can do?

982
00:54:12,350 --> 00:54:16,725
Strum your guitar and cry.

983
00:54:17,225 --> 00:54:17,808
Will you run away?

984
00:54:18,308 --> 00:54:20,891
"Darling... My darling."

985
00:54:21,391 --> 00:54:23,850
"It's the season of love."

986
00:54:24,350 --> 00:54:25,808
Call me in the evening.

987
00:54:26,308 --> 00:54:29,808
I'll go finish up with the engagement.

988
00:54:48,933 --> 00:54:54,433
Usmaan, your brother's going to meet his love tomorrow.

989
00:54:54,933 --> 00:54:57,225
So...

990
00:54:57,725 --> 00:55:00,808
On that occasion...let's...

991
00:55:01,308 --> 00:55:02,016
Oh...

992
00:55:02,516 --> 00:55:03,850
I don't drink...I don't...

993
00:55:04,350 --> 00:55:06,891
No?

994
00:55:07,391 --> 00:55:08,933
But...it's cold tonight.

995
00:55:09,433 --> 00:55:11,141
So you can take it for the cold.

996
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:12,350
Take it.

997
00:55:12,850 --> 00:55:16,266
Give me your glass.

998
00:55:16,766 --> 00:55:18,225
Come on.

999
00:55:18,725 --> 00:55:20,350
Enough. Enough.

1000
00:55:20,850 --> 00:55:21,933
Here.

1001
00:55:22,433 --> 00:55:25,933
Cheers!

1002
00:55:34,850 --> 00:55:38,641
You insisted and that's why I obliged...

1003
00:55:39,141 --> 00:55:41,725
...otherwise I don't have such habits

1004
00:55:42,225 --> 00:55:45,725
What...what...

1005
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:50,933
Can I ask you something?

1006
00:55:51,433 --> 00:55:54,933
Ask anything except for Kashmir.

1007
00:55:58,975 --> 00:56:02,141
Urdu is a very deadly language. - Why?

1008
00:56:02,641 --> 00:56:05,766
Like some things might be so trivial...

1009
00:56:06,266 --> 00:56:08,266
But in Urdu they sound so important.

1010
00:56:08,766 --> 00:56:09,600
Yeah.

1011
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:15,308
I used to think that 'Tashreef' is something special.

1012
00:56:15,808 --> 00:56:21,058
When I found out the real meaning (butt), I couldn't control my laughter...

1013
00:56:21,558 --> 00:56:23,016
Listen. - Yeah.

1014
00:56:23,516 --> 00:56:29,433
Are you mocking me?

1015
00:56:29,933 --> 00:56:32,100
You're taking me to see my Happy.

1016
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:35,225
You think I can mock you? - No-No.

1017
00:56:35,725 --> 00:56:39,225
Gurdeep Singh is not such a bad person. - No no Gurdeep

1018
00:56:39,725 --> 00:56:42,141
I wasn't making fun.

1019
00:56:42,641 --> 00:56:45,141
I understand...

1020
00:56:45,641 --> 00:56:50,433
Usmaan... what is this called in Urdu?

1021
00:56:50,933 --> 00:56:54,225
Oh this...

1022
00:56:54,725 --> 00:56:55,100
Go do it.

1023
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:59,350
Do it! Do it!

1024
00:56:59,850 --> 00:57:03,975
Brother Usmaan... you and Bilal are really great.

1025
00:57:04,475 --> 00:57:05,975
You lied for us.

1026
00:57:06,475 --> 00:57:07,891
You came here for us.

1027
00:57:08,391 --> 00:57:10,641
And you'll take me to Lahore tomorrow.

1028
00:57:11,141 --> 00:57:12,308
To my Happy.

1029
00:57:12,808 --> 00:57:13,933
We'll be so happy together.

1030
00:57:14,433 --> 00:57:17,516
I will meet with Happy... we'll get married.

1031
00:57:18,016 --> 00:57:19,516
And we'll have...

1032
00:57:20,016 --> 00:57:21,100
Hey!

1033
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:23,600
-I'll see how you get married...

1034
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:24,808
Brother, catch him. - Who?

1035
00:57:25,308 --> 00:57:26,183
Brother, we'll get sc****

1036
00:57:26,683 --> 00:57:29,808
Who? - Bagga's man... he's heard everything.

1037
00:57:30,308 --> 00:57:31,141
You're unbelievable.

1038
00:57:31,641 --> 00:57:35,141
Can't you look where you're peeing? - Brother...we'll be ruined.

1039
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:42,100
There he is. There he is.

1040
00:57:49,641 --> 00:57:53,183
He went left...Left...

1041
00:57:53,683 --> 00:57:57,183
That way..

1042
00:57:59,766 --> 00:58:03,933
That way, let's go.

1043
00:58:04,433 --> 00:58:06,600
Usman bro, faster! - He has fallen! He has fallen!

1044
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:08,016
I can't touch him!

1045
00:58:08,516 --> 00:58:11,933
He is reeking. How do we catch him?

1046
00:58:12,433 --> 00:58:13,600
Keep an eye on him, I'll find some papers.

1047
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:15,600
Paper's no good... give me that rod.

1048
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:17,350
Rod.

1049
00:58:17,850 --> 00:58:19,350
We'll beat him with the stick and tie him up in the sack.

1050
00:58:19,850 --> 00:58:19,975
Sit down.

1051
00:58:20,475 --> 00:58:23,391
Wear it. Wear it. Wear it.

1052
00:58:23,891 --> 00:58:27,391
Sit down.

1053
00:58:43,933 --> 00:58:46,100
Go on...and make a name for yourself.

1054
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:48,100
Round of applause!

1055
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:49,975
And listen...

1056
00:58:50,475 --> 00:58:53,016
Don't worry about Amritsar.

1057
00:58:53,516 --> 00:58:55,683
We just want to see you progress.

1058
00:58:56,183 --> 00:58:59,891
That too in a different country.

1059
00:59:00,391 --> 00:59:04,641
Kayloola... you're really cute.

1060
00:59:05,141 --> 00:59:11,016
If I get a chance, your brother will definitely come to Lahore to meet you.

1061
00:59:11,516 --> 00:59:14,725
Swear on me Bagga bro, do pay us a visit once.

1062
00:59:15,225 --> 00:59:16,266
Of course we will.

1063
00:59:16,766 --> 00:59:19,308
Get going...come on.

1064
00:59:19,808 --> 00:59:22,641
Get going to Pakistan.

1065
00:59:23,141 --> 00:59:24,641
Bagga? Bye, love you.

1066
00:59:25,141 --> 00:59:27,891
Love you too, Guddu.

1067
00:59:28,391 --> 00:59:29,933
Congratulations, brother.

1068
00:59:30,433 --> 00:59:35,766
Now that he's gone we can be at peace!

1069
00:59:36,266 --> 00:59:38,391
Is that Rajinder who's running towards us like a bull?

1070
00:59:38,891 --> 00:59:39,725
Move aside.

1071
00:59:40,225 --> 00:59:40,808
It is him, brother.

1072
00:59:41,308 --> 00:59:43,016
What's wrong with him?

1073
00:59:43,516 --> 00:59:46,433
Brother...stop the bus.

1074
00:59:46,933 --> 00:59:49,808
Did you spend the night with a pig? I can't stand the stench.

1075
00:59:50,308 --> 00:59:52,100
Brother, they are no music company guys.

1076
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:54,683
What? - Those guys from Lahore made a fool of you.

1077
00:59:55,183 --> 00:59:56,725
They'll get Guddu married there because...

1078
00:59:57,225 --> 01:00:00,100
Happy is in Pakistan.

1079
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:03,516
Dimpy, stop the bus!

1080
01:00:04,016 --> 01:00:07,516
Boss, the bus is in Pakistan.

1081
01:00:21,641 --> 01:00:24,058
Lord...

1082
01:00:24,558 --> 01:00:26,641
These idiots burned my papa's truck. - Dimple, keep these grass bundles..

1083
01:00:27,141 --> 01:00:28,100
..on the other side of the terrace.. - I hope they don't set me on fire...

1084
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:32,475
And that grass lying at the back...

1085
01:00:32,975 --> 01:00:33,433
Hey...

1086
01:00:33,933 --> 01:00:34,725
You.

1087
01:00:35,225 --> 01:00:36,975
Wasn't that your truck? - Hello.

1088
01:00:37,475 --> 01:00:39,308
Aren't you the one that helped Happy elope? - No, no.

1089
01:00:39,808 --> 01:00:40,391
Sweety! Rinky!

1090
01:00:40,891 --> 01:00:41,975
Dimple! Dolly...come out everyone. - You offered me desert that day...

1091
01:00:42,475 --> 01:00:42,725
He's the rascal.

1092
01:00:43,225 --> 01:00:44,516
No-no, you're mistaken.

1093
01:00:45,016 --> 01:00:45,891
Mistaken... - No...

1094
01:00:46,391 --> 01:00:48,475
I'll set you straight, you rascal.

1095
01:00:48,975 --> 01:00:50,850
I swear I will take your life today.

1096
01:00:51,350 --> 01:00:52,100
Why will you take my life?

1097
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:52,850
Stop hitting me with that broom...

1098
01:00:53,350 --> 01:00:53,850
It's covered with dung.

1099
01:00:54,350 --> 01:00:55,308
Look, I did try to help Happy elope.

1100
01:00:55,808 --> 01:00:56,225
But I couldn't.

1101
01:00:56,725 --> 01:00:57,725
And on top of that they burnt my father's truck.

1102
01:00:58,225 --> 01:00:59,100
You... to hell with your truck

1103
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:00,850
I'm going to tell father all about you.

1104
01:01:01,350 --> 01:01:01,725
Father!

1105
01:01:02,225 --> 01:01:03,350
Why will you tell father anything?

1106
01:01:03,850 --> 01:01:05,266
Take this letter. Guddu has sent it.

1107
01:01:05,766 --> 01:01:06,350
Guddu... - Give it to uncle.

1108
01:01:06,850 --> 01:01:08,516
And I'll clear your misconceptions later.

1109
01:01:09,016 --> 01:01:09,516
Father... - Bye.

1110
01:01:10,016 --> 01:01:11,058
Swine, he's making a run for it.

1111
01:01:11,558 --> 01:01:12,516
Don't ever show your face here again.

1112
01:01:13,016 --> 01:01:16,516
This is a madhouse!

1113
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:35,100
Where's uncle? - Papa!

1114
01:01:39,266 --> 01:01:43,516
What do you want now?

1115
01:01:44,016 --> 01:01:46,683
Papa...

1116
01:01:47,183 --> 01:01:50,683
..we've found Happy.

1117
01:02:02,266 --> 01:02:03,850
Boss, get to the point.

1118
01:02:04,350 --> 01:02:06,350
He thinks she's in the next lane... he's going on-foot.

1119
01:02:06,850 --> 01:02:08,933
Papa...

1120
01:02:09,433 --> 01:02:12,933
Happy...is in Lahore.

1121
01:02:18,308 --> 01:02:22,183
Where? - Pakistan.

1122
01:02:22,683 --> 01:02:24,641
Stop talking about bloodshed...

1123
01:02:25,141 --> 01:02:27,100
...and listen to what I am saying.

1124
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:29,891
Only I can take you there.

1125
01:02:30,391 --> 01:02:34,933
Because those officials will hand-over the girl only to her relatives.

1126
01:02:35,433 --> 01:02:36,725
Come with me quietly.

1127
01:02:37,225 --> 01:02:42,100
Let's bring her back here, and get her married to me.

1128
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:44,516
She's already made me dance to her tunes

1129
01:02:45,016 --> 01:02:45,975
And I did.

1130
01:02:46,475 --> 01:02:47,808
Not anymore

1131
01:02:48,308 --> 01:02:51,141
Brother, it'll take around 4-5 days to get there.

1132
01:02:51,641 --> 01:02:55,225
And what if... - Leave all that to me.

1133
01:02:55,725 --> 01:02:57,308
So what if it's Lahore.

1134
01:02:57,808 --> 01:02:59,725
Your brother is adamant.

1135
01:03:00,225 --> 01:03:03,183
We'll cross the border too.

1136
01:03:03,683 --> 01:03:07,183
Father...please, come here.

1137
01:03:16,558 --> 01:03:20,516
Father, Guddu's friend gave this.

1138
01:03:21,016 --> 01:03:23,016
Read it.

1139
01:03:23,516 --> 01:03:24,891
"Greetings, father."

1140
01:03:25,391 --> 01:03:27,350
"Happy is in La..."

1141
01:03:27,850 --> 01:03:30,183
"Happy is in Lahore and she's safe."

1142
01:03:30,683 --> 01:03:32,850
"I am going to bring her back."

1143
01:03:33,350 --> 01:03:36,475
"I didn't want to leave without your blessings."

1144
01:03:36,975 --> 01:03:39,058
"But I couldn't muster the courage to face you."

1145
01:03:39,558 --> 01:03:42,058
"Even if I've to lay down my life..."

1146
01:03:42,558 --> 01:03:46,141
"...bringing Happy back home is my responsibility."

1147
01:03:46,641 --> 01:03:48,475
"Pray to God for our well-being."

1148
01:03:48,975 --> 01:03:53,016
"Your good-for-nothing son...Guddu."

1149
01:03:53,516 --> 01:03:55,308
Boss, we have a contact across the border

1150
01:03:55,808 --> 01:03:58,516
Should I call him?

1151
01:03:59,016 --> 01:04:01,891
Yes, papa. What do we do?

1152
01:04:02,391 --> 01:04:03,391
Let's go to Pakistan.

1153
01:04:03,891 --> 01:04:06,850
Ishtiyaq Khan's constituency is the ideal constituency...

1154
01:04:07,350 --> 01:04:08,266
...in entire Pakistan, sir.

1155
01:04:08,766 --> 01:04:11,766
Electricity, water, corruption, unemployment, unmarried girls...

1156
01:04:12,266 --> 01:04:14,141
...are some of the small issues.

1157
01:04:14,641 --> 01:04:17,141
And according to you this event is a solution to all your problems.

1158
01:04:17,641 --> 01:04:18,683
Think about it, sir.

1159
01:04:19,183 --> 01:04:20,516
100 couples getting married altogether.

1160
01:04:21,016 --> 01:04:23,433
Unemployed young men will find a job...

1161
01:04:23,933 --> 01:04:26,100
...unmarried girls will no longer be unmarried.

1162
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:31,058
We're only facing a little budget issue.

1163
01:04:31,558 --> 01:04:33,100
100 couples, huh?

1164
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:37,141
Try getting one married, it's not that easy.

1165
01:04:37,641 --> 01:04:39,433
Wow...what a statement.

1166
01:04:39,933 --> 01:04:40,266
Great.

1167
01:04:40,766 --> 01:04:42,516
You've no idea what I just said, do you?

1168
01:04:43,016 --> 01:04:44,308
Absolutely right, sir. Absolutely right.

1169
01:04:44,808 --> 01:04:46,350
Mr. Junior! Mr. Junior! Mr. Junior!

1170
01:04:46,850 --> 01:04:48,100
The Chinese have cancelled the conference.

1171
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:49,350
What? - Yes.

1172
01:04:49,850 --> 01:04:51,475
Mr. Senior is returning today afternoon.

1173
01:04:51,975 --> 01:04:54,475
What? - Yes!

1174
01:04:54,975 --> 01:04:56,391
I have to go. - Of course, yours is an international issue.

1175
01:04:56,891 --> 01:04:58,641
By Allah, look at what you've turned into.

1176
01:04:59,141 --> 01:04:59,433
Goodbye. - Goodbye

1177
01:04:59,933 --> 01:05:01,516
Oh Lord, cancel his flight... Take it to Africa

1178
01:05:02,016 --> 01:05:02,975
He speaks English very well, did you see?

1179
01:05:03,475 --> 01:05:04,891
Afridi. - Yes, Mr. Junior.

1180
01:05:05,391 --> 01:05:09,516
We've arrived in Pakistan with your guest-of-honor from India.

1181
01:05:10,016 --> 01:05:12,308
And very soon we'll be arriving at your abode.

1182
01:05:12,808 --> 01:05:16,141
No. The Pride-of-Pakistan is returning to his abode.

1183
01:05:16,641 --> 01:05:18,641
Take our guest-of-honor from India to some hotel.

1184
01:05:19,141 --> 01:05:19,683
And inform.

1185
01:05:20,183 --> 01:05:22,516
I'll send the gift-from-India and the headache-of-my-life there.

1186
01:05:23,016 --> 01:05:25,475
Sir...I also had an important piece of news.

1187
01:05:25,975 --> 01:05:26,058
Speak.

1188
01:05:26,558 --> 01:05:30,058
The enemy-of-love Bagga has learned about our intentions.

1189
01:05:35,016 --> 01:05:35,725
And how did that happen?

1190
01:05:36,225 --> 01:05:37,975
A stupid sycophant overheard my conversation..

1191
01:05:38,475 --> 01:05:40,600
..with the guest-of-honor from India.

1192
01:05:41,100 --> 01:05:42,975
Any other good news...

1193
01:05:43,475 --> 01:05:45,391
..otherwise hang up and spare my life.

1194
01:05:45,891 --> 01:05:47,391
One small advice.

1195
01:05:47,891 --> 01:05:50,016
The flight that was supposed to take...

1196
01:05:50,516 --> 01:05:53,683
...the detainees to Delhi 5 days later, I had included their names as well.

1197
01:05:54,183 --> 01:05:57,391
But now that Mr. Senior has returned, so...

1198
01:05:57,891 --> 01:05:59,683
5 days.

1199
01:06:00,183 --> 01:06:02,266
Damnit Afridi!

1200
01:06:02,766 --> 01:06:05,308
I see...

1201
01:06:05,808 --> 01:06:06,433
Damnit!

1202
01:06:06,933 --> 01:06:07,975
Do you know what that means? - No.

1203
01:06:08,475 --> 01:06:10,725
He asked us to get a taxi.

1204
01:06:11,225 --> 01:06:14,725
Come on.

1205
01:06:21,225 --> 01:06:22,516
What's the point in sitting here?

1206
01:06:23,016 --> 01:06:24,933
What's the point in standing?

1207
01:06:25,433 --> 01:06:27,766
We'll deal with Bagga when he gets here.

1208
01:06:28,266 --> 01:06:29,600
We'll make some other plan for the wedding.

1209
01:06:30,100 --> 01:06:32,725
At least Guddu's here.

1210
01:06:33,225 --> 01:06:35,350
Happy...you're unbelievable.

1211
01:06:35,850 --> 01:06:37,141
We're getting into one trouble after another.

1212
01:06:37,641 --> 01:06:39,808
And you... are still going headstrong.

1213
01:06:40,308 --> 01:06:41,975
Unaffected.

1214
01:06:42,475 --> 01:06:43,933
Do you think life is a film?

1215
01:06:44,433 --> 01:06:47,141
No...I treat life as life.

1216
01:06:47,641 --> 01:06:50,933
I won't let father or Bagga intimidate me,

1217
01:06:51,433 --> 01:06:53,725
And what's the worst that can happen with me?

1218
01:06:54,225 --> 01:06:57,183
I won't get what I want. Right?

1219
01:06:57,683 --> 01:07:02,933
But at least I'll be satisfied that I tried my best.

1220
01:07:03,433 --> 01:07:05,516
If you two have finished exchanging dialogues...

1221
01:07:06,016 --> 01:07:07,475
...can we finish the coffee?

1222
01:07:07,975 --> 01:07:09,391
I want to see Guddu.

1223
01:07:09,891 --> 01:07:13,391
And I am sure Happy wants to see him too.

1224
01:07:18,766 --> 01:07:22,350
Yes, Fakhru uncle. All fine? - What fine? Nothing's fine.

1225
01:07:22,850 --> 01:07:25,391
Mr. Junior, Mr. Senior has returned home.

1226
01:07:25,891 --> 01:07:30,100
And Zoya's father is here too. - What?

1227
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:32,266
Did this have to happen now?

1228
01:07:32,766 --> 01:07:35,683
Uncle...this is a trial for you and aunt Rifat.

1229
01:07:36,183 --> 01:07:37,100
I don't care what you have to do.

1230
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:39,808
But don't let him mention Happy at all.

1231
01:07:40,308 --> 02:15:20,574
Okay.

1232
01:07:40,766 --> 01:07:41,933
Definitely not, Mr. Junior.

1233
01:07:42,433 --> 01:07:43,183
Definitely not.

1234
01:07:43,683 --> 01:07:44,850
Definitely not.

1235
01:07:45,350 --> 01:07:47,641
What happened? - Your father's at my home.

1236
01:07:48,141 --> 01:07:50,016
What if he mentions about the mute cousin?

1237
01:07:50,516 --> 01:07:51,100
I am going home now.

1238
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:53,350
You can coordinate with Afridi for Guddu's hotel.

1239
01:07:53,850 --> 01:07:57,058
Bring me the check.

1240
01:07:57,558 --> 01:07:59,350
This feels just like back home.

1241
01:07:59,850 --> 01:08:03,350
Just like Yash sir showed us...in 'Veer-Zara'.

1242
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:07,683
What are you thinking?

1243
01:08:08,183 --> 01:08:11,683
I was thinking...I wish Yash Chopra was in Pakistan.

1244
01:08:16,641 --> 01:08:19,808
Usmaan ...call up Happy.

1245
01:08:20,308 --> 01:08:21,516
Be patient.

1246
01:08:22,016 --> 01:08:24,391
Mr. Junior... will take you to Happy.

1247
01:08:24,891 --> 01:08:26,683
In fact, he would've already united you two...

1248
01:08:27,183 --> 01:08:29,766
...if Mr. Senior hadn't suddenly arrived from China.

1249
01:08:30,266 --> 01:08:31,891
You're right, Mr. Zia.

1250
01:08:32,391 --> 01:08:35,808
Our country isn't functioning to its fullest capacity.

1251
01:08:36,308 --> 01:08:38,100
It's hard to find a powerful politician.

1252
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:39,683
Why not?

1253
01:08:40,183 --> 01:08:41,350
There's Bilal.

1254
01:08:41,850 --> 01:08:43,016
Bilal has all the makings.

1255
01:08:43,516 --> 01:08:47,516
Of course. I am sure one day this boy will change the history of Pakistan.

1256
01:08:48,016 --> 01:08:48,683
Of course.

1257
01:08:49,183 --> 01:08:52,141
Actually...even I have a talented nephew, he's from Peshawar.

1258
01:08:52,641 --> 01:08:54,641
But he can't do speech and rallies.

1259
01:08:55,141 --> 01:08:58,350
Unfortunately...he stammers.

1260
01:08:58,850 --> 01:09:00,600
I'll introduce him to Bilal someday.

1261
01:09:01,100 --> 01:09:03,183
By the way, where is Bilal?

1262
01:09:03,683 --> 01:09:06,058
Must be doing some kind of public service.

1263
01:09:06,558 --> 01:09:09,850
I did meet Bilal the other day at home. - I see.

1264
01:09:10,350 --> 01:09:14,266
And with him was that... - Sugar?

1265
01:09:14,766 --> 01:09:15,683
Sugar, Mr. Senior?

1266
01:09:16,183 --> 01:09:16,975
What's wrong with you, Fakhru?

1267
01:09:17,475 --> 01:09:21,225
You know I am diabetic. I have stopped taking sugar since a long time.

1268
01:09:21,725 --> 01:09:23,183
Pardon my insolence, Mr. Senior.

1269
01:09:23,683 --> 01:09:26,391
I was asking Zia sir. - So ask him.

1270
01:09:26,891 --> 01:09:29,100
Sugar?

1271
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:30,766
One spoon. Thanks. - Yes.

1272
01:09:31,266 --> 01:09:33,100
So what were you saying? - I was saying...

1273
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:36,391
Only one spoon? - Yes, yes only one spoon.

1274
01:09:36,891 --> 01:09:37,350
Yes.

1275
01:09:37,850 --> 01:09:39,808
Zia sir, what were you saying?

1276
01:09:40,308 --> 01:09:42,141
I was saying, when he came home...

1277
01:09:42,641 --> 01:09:45,391
...there was a girl with him, she was from Karachi...

1278
01:09:45,891 --> 01:09:47,100
What the hell man!

1279
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:48,475
Be careful...be careful, Zia sir.

1280
01:09:48,975 --> 01:09:50,808
I held it properly, I wonder what happened.

1281
01:09:51,308 --> 01:09:53,641
Stop staring at him...give him a tissue. - Yes, yes, yes...

1282
01:09:54,141 --> 01:09:54,891
Here you go.

1283
01:09:55,391 --> 01:09:57,808
And go call Rifat. - Of course.

1284
01:09:58,308 --> 01:09:58,683
I'm done here...

1285
01:09:59,183 --> 01:10:00,350
Yes, so Zia sir what were you saying?

1286
01:10:00,850 --> 01:10:03,683
When you met Bilal? - Yes, I was saying...

1287
01:10:04,183 --> 01:10:07,100
Greetings, sir. Greetings, Zia sir...you called?

1288
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:08,475
Yes, I did.

1289
01:10:08,975 --> 01:10:12,266
Stand quietly. We're talking.

1290
01:10:12,766 --> 01:10:13,850
Yes, Zia sir. - Yes...

1291
01:10:14,350 --> 01:10:19,766
So, your niece... - W-w-why are you scolding me?

1292
01:10:20,266 --> 01:10:21,641
I've been working for you for all these years...

1293
01:10:22,141 --> 01:10:23,225
...and you didn't fulfill your promise either.

1294
01:10:23,725 --> 01:10:25,266
What nonsense? What promise?

1295
01:10:25,766 --> 01:10:26,683
Your promise to gift a necklace to Huriya.

1296
01:10:27,183 --> 01:10:29,225
Huriya? - My niece, Huriya.

1297
01:10:29,725 --> 01:10:30,891
I've selected the design as well.

1298
01:10:31,391 --> 01:10:33,683
If you won't do it, then who else will?

1299
01:10:34,183 --> 01:10:35,683
She's a poor kid, Zia sir.

1300
01:10:36,183 --> 01:10:38,308
If only madam had been alive, then...

1301
01:10:38,808 --> 01:10:40,433
Fine-fine... you'll get the necklace.

1302
01:10:40,933 --> 01:10:44,433
Now go... Leave!

1303
01:10:44,933 --> 01:10:46,600
Yes, Zia sir what were you saying?

1304
01:10:47,100 --> 01:10:50,350
I was saying that your mute niece from...

1305
01:10:50,850 --> 01:10:54,433
You'll get the necklace for me? - Yes, I will-I will-I will.

1306
01:10:54,933 --> 01:10:58,433
Now go from here.

1307
01:11:00,266 --> 01:11:03,975
Rifat! Rifat! Rifat!

1308
01:11:04,475 --> 01:11:08,475
How can someone shoulder so much burden at this age, Zia sir?

1309
01:11:08,975 --> 01:11:09,225
Yes.

1310
01:11:09,725 --> 01:11:12,766
These days Rifat often faints. - I see.

1311
01:11:13,266 --> 01:11:15,100
Should I call the doctor? - Yes yes call the doctor.

1312
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:15,766
Yes.

1313
01:11:16,266 --> 01:11:18,433
And sprinkle some water on her.

1314
01:11:18,933 --> 01:11:20,266
Javed sir. - Yes.

1315
01:11:20,766 --> 01:11:23,641
Let's schedule the meeting for tomorrow? - Yes...yes...

1316
01:11:24,141 --> 01:11:25,933
We'll keep it for tomorrow. - Great.

1317
01:11:26,433 --> 01:11:27,683
See you.

1318
01:11:28,183 --> 01:11:29,683
Fakhru, go get some water.

1319
01:11:30,183 --> 01:11:31,141
Sprinkle water on her.

1320
01:11:31,641 --> 01:11:33,016
Javed sir. - Yes.

1321
01:11:33,516 --> 01:11:35,891
Give Happy my love. - Happy?

1322
01:11:36,391 --> 01:11:38,808
Happy who?

1323
01:11:39,308 --> 01:11:42,100
We tried our best, Junior... but Zia sir told him everything.

1324
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:42,850
Everything!

1325
01:11:43,350 --> 01:11:44,350
He came here with the intentions of saying it.

1326
01:11:44,850 --> 01:11:46,350
And not just the fake mute girl...

1327
01:11:46,850 --> 01:11:48,433
...he even spoke about a stammering nephew.

1328
01:11:48,933 --> 01:11:50,016
I even spilled tea on him but it didn't work.

1329
01:11:50,516 --> 01:11:54,016
Didn't work.

1330
01:11:58,516 --> 01:12:02,100
You called?

1331
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:05,933
What do you know about Happy? - Happy.

1332
01:12:06,433 --> 01:12:09,225
Same thing which the world does. - What?

1333
01:12:09,725 --> 01:12:12,516
Well 'Happy' is a state of mind...

1334
01:12:13,016 --> 01:12:15,016
...that gives emotional happiness.

1335
01:12:15,516 --> 01:12:18,100
I am not talking about 'state of mind'.

1336
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:19,266
I am talking about the girl...

1337
01:12:19,766 --> 01:12:25,058
...whom you introduced to Mr. Zia as your mute cousin last week...

1338
01:12:25,558 --> 01:12:29,516
Last week? - Yes.

1339
01:12:30,016 --> 01:12:32,475
Was it at his home? - Of course.

1340
01:12:32,975 --> 01:12:34,933
Yeah...

1341
01:12:35,433 --> 01:12:37,391
Although it was just Zoya and me...

1342
01:12:37,891 --> 01:12:40,725
...but according to uncle Zia there were two more people there.

1343
01:12:41,225 --> 01:12:45,850
Meaning? - I mean uncle Zia kept saying that...

1344
01:12:46,350 --> 01:12:50,183
...his nephew from Peshawar was also there, who stammers.

1345
01:12:50,683 --> 01:12:56,350
And your niece from Karachi, who is mute.

1346
01:12:56,850 --> 01:13:02,516
And...if I remember correctly he kept saying...

1347
01:13:03,016 --> 01:13:05,350
"The nephew spilled tea... then he said no."

1348
01:13:05,850 --> 01:13:09,350
"No, I spilled it...then he said it just tipped over."

1349
01:13:09,850 --> 01:13:12,016
Something like that.

1350
01:13:12,516 --> 01:13:13,433
Oh my, God.

1351
01:13:13,933 --> 01:13:17,100
What's wrong, father? - Even today...

1352
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:21,058
Did he see his nephew and niece here as well?

1353
01:13:21,558 --> 01:13:24,058
Schizophrenia?

1354
01:13:24,558 --> 01:13:28,391
He's crazy?

1355
01:13:28,891 --> 01:13:33,058
Does...Zoya know?

1356
01:13:33,558 --> 01:13:36,475
Poor thing... since her childhood days...

1357
01:13:36,975 --> 01:13:41,266
...she's been hearing of another mother who's from Rawalpindi, and is deaf.

1358
01:13:41,766 --> 01:13:43,225
Why didn't you tell me?

1359
01:13:43,725 --> 01:13:45,600
How could I tell you, father?

1360
01:13:46,100 --> 01:13:48,266
We're childhood friends, you even fixed our marriage.

1361
01:13:48,766 --> 01:13:52,433
And...I know that's for the best interest of the country.

1362
01:13:52,933 --> 01:13:56,266
And you've always said that no one's above our country.

1363
01:13:56,766 --> 01:14:00,266
So for the sake of my country... I stayed quiet...

1364
01:14:04,350 --> 01:14:06,100
Unbelievable, son.

1365
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:10,891
Look at what you have turned into.

1366
01:14:11,391 --> 01:14:13,100
I'm so proud of you.

1367
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:16,058
So proud of you.

1368
01:14:16,558 --> 01:14:20,391
Father, I've thought of an idea for your campaign.

1369
01:14:20,891 --> 01:14:22,308
Yes...tell me, son.

1370
01:14:22,808 --> 01:14:25,808
Why don't we get 100 couples married altogether?

1371
01:14:26,308 --> 01:14:28,600
You know...poor boys and girls, in one grand event.

1372
01:14:29,100 --> 01:14:32,350
And along with this announcement, Zoya and I will announce our wedding date too.

1373
01:14:32,850 --> 01:14:34,350
You know, to the media, to the public.

1374
01:14:34,850 --> 01:14:35,641
It will benefit your campaign...

1375
01:14:36,141 --> 01:14:40,766
...and 100 couples will do the job...5 days later.

1376
01:14:41,266 --> 01:14:44,766
Amazing.

1377
01:14:46,516 --> 01:14:50,641
I can see the future Prime Minister of this country in you.

1378
01:14:51,141 --> 01:14:54,266
And I am sure...you will change the history of Pakistan!

1379
01:14:54,766 --> 01:14:57,058
...of Pakistan, I know Dad!

1380
01:14:57,558 --> 01:14:59,391
But how will we arrange it in 5 days?

1381
01:14:59,891 --> 01:15:00,766
We'll manage it, father.

1382
01:15:01,266 --> 01:15:04,766
It must happen in 5 days.

1383
01:15:07,516 --> 01:15:10,266
How many times more will I have to lie?

1384
01:15:10,766 --> 01:15:12,641
Amazing, Mr. Junior.

1385
01:15:13,141 --> 01:15:14,683
Finally you've become an A-grade politician.

1386
01:15:15,183 --> 01:15:16,266
With a single blow you knocked out Zia sir...

1387
01:15:16,766 --> 01:15:19,641
...and made things easier for Happy and Guddu too.

1388
01:15:20,141 --> 01:15:22,683
Let's hope we wrap up everything before Bagga arrives.

1389
01:15:23,183 --> 01:15:27,058
Allah has made a strange relation between you and this girl?

1390
01:15:27,558 --> 01:15:30,975
A boy that never stood up in front of Mr. Senior for his own desires...

1391
01:15:31,475 --> 01:15:36,516
...is doing everything possible for this stranger...

1392
01:15:37,016 --> 01:15:38,933
Yeah, Zo!

1393
01:15:39,433 --> 01:15:40,308
What?

1394
01:15:40,808 --> 01:15:43,475
When? How?

1395
01:15:43,975 --> 01:15:44,266
Relax, Zo.

1396
01:15:44,766 --> 01:15:46,975
Just relax. Just get a hold of yourself. I am coming right now.

1397
01:15:47,475 --> 01:15:49,100
Sir...

1398
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:53,808
Happy's missing. - Missing, again?

1399
01:15:54,308 --> 01:15:56,808
Rasheed Lala speaking.

1400
01:15:57,308 --> 01:16:00,100
Your parcel has been picked up

1401
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:02,183
Day after tomorrow?

1402
01:16:02,683 --> 01:16:03,475
Okay.

1403
01:16:03,975 --> 01:16:06,891
My man will pick you up from the bus depot.

1404
01:16:07,391 --> 01:16:08,683
Boss, do something.

1405
01:16:09,183 --> 01:16:10,475
Irfan and Moin are in a bad state.

1406
01:16:10,975 --> 01:16:13,766
Do you want to give Rasheed Lala a bad name?

1407
01:16:14,266 --> 01:16:15,516
You can't handle a girl?

1408
01:16:16,016 --> 01:16:17,683
Come on.

1409
01:16:18,183 --> 01:16:19,225
Boss, I am quitting this job.

1410
01:16:19,725 --> 01:16:20,391
Get inside.

1411
01:16:20,891 --> 01:16:22,683
Water... brother, water.

1412
01:16:23,183 --> 01:16:24,350
Open her mouth, I want to talk to her.

1413
01:16:24,850 --> 01:16:28,350
Me? - Yes, you.

1414
01:16:32,183 --> 01:16:33,975
Listen, girl... - You want me to listen? Me?

1415
01:16:34,475 --> 01:16:35,141
You listen...

1416
01:16:35,641 --> 01:16:39,350
Just set me free and I will mop the floor with you and your sycophants...

1417
01:16:39,850 --> 01:16:40,725
...or my name isn't Happy.

1418
01:16:41,225 --> 01:16:44,516
Bloody oafs, how dare you abduct me? How dare you!

1419
01:16:45,016 --> 01:16:46,933
You guys have no idea what you've done.

1420
01:16:47,433 --> 01:16:50,266
And you, rotten apple... you're their leader, right?

1421
01:16:50,766 --> 01:16:53,391
Go and round up some more boys.

1422
01:16:53,891 --> 01:16:57,308
Once I free myself, you won't be able to save yourselves.

1423
01:16:57,808 --> 01:17:00,308
What are you staring at? - Shut her up. Shut her up.

1424
01:17:00,808 --> 01:17:01,808
I won't spare anyone.

1425
01:17:02,308 --> 01:17:04,058
What do we do, boss? - Dance!

1426
01:17:04,558 --> 01:17:05,225
Bloody donkey!

1427
01:17:05,725 --> 01:17:06,975
Don't open her mouth at any cost.

1428
01:17:07,475 --> 01:17:07,891
Understand.

1429
01:17:08,391 --> 01:17:11,391
Give her whatever she wants through a hole in her gag.

1430
01:17:11,891 --> 01:17:13,350
Call up Jalal and tell him to send more boys.

1431
01:17:13,850 --> 01:17:16,808
8-10-12... any number of boys available.

1432
01:17:17,308 --> 01:17:19,308
Don't take that gag out!

1433
01:17:19,808 --> 01:17:20,766
I don't understand what you're saying.

1434
01:17:21,266 --> 01:17:22,058
Afridi, I am telling you...

1435
01:17:22,558 --> 01:17:23,391
Afridi, I am telling you she was sitting on the left.

1436
01:17:23,891 --> 01:17:24,891
She was sitting on the left, and disappeared.

1437
01:17:25,391 --> 01:17:27,100
No, when I got down...

1438
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:28,600
Look... - How can you disappear? - Not me.

1439
01:17:29,100 --> 01:17:31,016
Bagga. Bagga.

1440
01:17:31,516 --> 01:17:34,141
This is Bagga's doing.

1441
01:17:34,641 --> 01:17:36,641
But...the address?

1442
01:17:37,141 --> 01:17:38,183
How difficult can it be, Afridi?

1443
01:17:38,683 --> 01:17:40,475
Maybe someone was following you from the bus depot.

1444
01:17:40,975 --> 01:17:43,016
Waiting for him to get here...

1445
01:17:43,516 --> 01:17:45,058
But...what do we do now?

1446
01:17:45,558 --> 01:17:47,141
Bagga's abducted her. - Hmmm.

1447
01:17:47,641 --> 01:17:50,308
Then he must be coming here too.

1448
01:17:50,808 --> 01:17:54,766
There's just one way to get here.

1449
01:17:55,266 --> 01:17:57,183
Make arrangements, Afridi.

1450
01:17:57,683 --> 01:17:58,850
If he sets foot in the bus depot...

1451
01:17:59,350 --> 01:18:00,641
...he's immediately picked up by the patrolling car.

1452
01:18:01,141 --> 01:18:05,350
His men abducted Happy, we'll abduct Bagga.

1453
01:18:05,850 --> 01:18:07,683
Guddu!

1454
01:18:08,183 --> 01:18:11,433
Guddu! - It's all a mess.

1455
01:18:11,933 --> 01:18:13,516
She's already been through a lot because of me.

1456
01:18:14,016 --> 01:18:16,891
God knows how much more she will have to suffer?

1457
01:18:17,391 --> 01:18:20,850
I...just...hope nothing wrong has happened to her.

1458
01:18:21,350 --> 01:18:22,641
She will be fine.

1459
01:18:23,141 --> 01:18:26,266
You love her, don't you know her?

1460
01:18:26,766 --> 01:18:27,975
If she shows her true colors...

1461
01:18:28,475 --> 01:18:30,266
...then those who abducted her will bring her back.

1462
01:18:30,766 --> 01:18:34,433
And apologise too.

1463
01:18:34,933 --> 01:18:36,016
She's Happy.

1464
01:18:36,516 --> 01:18:38,475
Happy.

1465
01:18:38,975 --> 01:18:42,475
She's much stronger than you and I.

1466
01:18:48,266 --> 01:18:50,975
Zoya...we'll continue preparations for the wedding.

1467
01:18:51,475 --> 01:18:53,016
Happy will definitely get married on that same day...

1468
01:18:53,516 --> 01:18:57,475
...and return to India on that same flight.

1469
01:18:57,975 --> 01:18:59,350
Guddu

1470
01:18:59,850 --> 01:19:02,350
Try to find out when he will leave from Amritsar.

1471
01:19:02,850 --> 01:19:05,933
And if we can find out his Lahore contacts, even better.

1472
01:19:06,433 --> 01:19:08,433
Afridi...

1473
01:19:08,933 --> 01:19:12,433
Look, Mr. Junior, the problem is...

1474
01:19:28,725 --> 01:19:32,600
We'll find Happy.

1475
01:19:33,100 --> 01:19:36,766
I was 17 years old... when father brought me away...

1476
01:19:37,266 --> 01:19:39,016
...from Faislabad Cricket Camp.

1477
01:19:39,516 --> 01:19:41,433
Every night I would think about running away.

1478
01:19:41,933 --> 01:19:45,350
Chasing happiness, chasing my dreams...

1479
01:19:45,850 --> 01:19:48,725
It's been 16 years... but I could never muster the courage.

1480
01:19:49,225 --> 01:19:51,100
Happy never thinks for a moment.

1481
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:55,350
She just runs away.

1482
01:19:55,850 --> 01:20:00,933
My way of living life is wrong, hers is right.

1483
01:20:01,433 --> 01:20:04,933
And I won't let it proved otherwise.

1484
01:20:12,141 --> 01:20:15,891
Rawalpindi. - Huh?

1485
01:20:16,391 --> 01:20:19,891
The cricket camp was in Rawalpindi.

1486
01:20:27,725 --> 01:20:31,225
I love you. - I love you too.

1487
01:20:42,433 --> 01:20:48,266
"I've 100 dreams...but one life."

1488
01:20:48,766 --> 01:20:54,475
"How do I choose what I want?"

1489
01:20:54,975 --> 01:21:00,808
"Maybe you won't say yes..."

1490
01:21:01,308 --> 01:21:06,058
"Yet I am waiting for you to say no."

1491
01:21:06,558 --> 01:21:09,100
"You're the journey, you're the path."

1492
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:12,266
"You're the caravan."

1493
01:21:12,766 --> 01:21:17,891
"How do I walk without you?"

1494
01:21:18,391 --> 01:21:20,975
"Just be my friend."

1495
01:21:21,475 --> 01:21:24,100
"Just be my companion."

1496
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:27,850
"Walk a few steps along with me..."

1497
01:21:28,350 --> 01:21:30,433
"...even if you choose to be a stranger later."

1498
01:21:30,933 --> 01:21:33,433
"Just be my friend."

1499
01:21:33,933 --> 01:21:36,600
"Just be my companion."

1500
01:21:37,100 --> 01:21:40,266
"Walk a few steps along with me..." - Greetings, respected guests.

1501
01:21:40,766 --> 01:21:43,850
I am really happy to share this news with you...

1502
01:21:44,350 --> 01:21:48,183
...that the future leader of a futuristic Pakistan and my son Bilal Ahmed...

1503
01:21:48,683 --> 01:21:53,100
...has made an emotional and noble decision of...

1504
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:59,183
...marrying the daughter of Lahore's well-known businessman Mr. Zia Rehmani.

1505
01:21:59,683 --> 01:22:03,016
And I am sure that this step will be a hallmark...

1506
01:22:03,516 --> 01:22:08,725
...which will change the history of Pakistan.

1507
01:22:09,225 --> 01:22:10,391
Did you speak with Wahab?

1508
01:22:10,891 --> 01:22:14,225
Not yet sir but I've put 8-10 officers on the job...

1509
01:22:14,725 --> 01:22:17,308
Send Happy's picture to Wahab and have him call me.

1510
01:22:17,808 --> 01:22:20,641
Yes, right away.

1511
01:22:21,141 --> 01:22:22,516
Congratulations.

1512
01:22:23,016 --> 01:22:25,100
Huh?

1513
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:28,183
Our wedding date's been fixed.

1514
01:22:28,683 --> 01:22:32,391
Oh yeah...congratulations.

1515
01:22:32,891 --> 01:22:35,266
Bilal, the media's calling you for some pictures.

1516
01:22:35,766 --> 01:22:39,266
Tell them we're coming.

1517
01:22:46,350 --> 01:22:52,016
"After meeting you my heart was assured."

1518
01:22:52,516 --> 01:22:58,266
"I look the most beautiful in the mirror."

1519
01:22:58,766 --> 01:23:04,475
"When you skirt your eyes, I feel..."

1520
01:23:04,975 --> 01:23:10,016
"Everyone else looks better than me."

1521
01:23:10,516 --> 01:23:13,183
"Go if you want...take your loyalty."

1522
01:23:13,683 --> 01:23:16,183
"Take your wishes."

1523
01:23:16,683 --> 01:23:21,850
"Just give me that one look."

1524
01:23:22,350 --> 01:23:24,975
"Just be my friend."

1525
01:23:25,475 --> 01:23:28,058
"Just be my companion."

1526
01:23:28,558 --> 01:23:31,808
"Walk a few steps along with me..."

1527
01:23:32,308 --> 01:23:34,391
"...even if you choose to be a stranger later."

1528
01:23:34,891 --> 01:23:37,475
"Just be my friend."

1529
01:23:37,975 --> 01:23:40,600
"Just be my companion."

1530
01:23:41,100 --> 01:23:44,225
"Walk a few steps along with me..."

1531
01:23:44,725 --> 01:23:48,225
"...even if you choose to be a stranger later."

1532
01:24:02,141 --> 01:24:03,808
He's arriving by tomorrow's bus. - 100 percent?

1533
01:24:04,308 --> 01:24:04,891
Winkle told me.

1534
01:24:05,391 --> 01:24:10,350
Bagga's man told him this. - Fantastic...superb...

1535
01:24:10,850 --> 01:24:12,725
Afridi...Bagga's arriving by tomorrow's bus.

1536
01:24:13,225 --> 01:24:15,766
Look, someone will definitely go to receive him.

1537
01:24:16,266 --> 01:24:19,766
He'll tell us where Happy is.

1538
01:24:22,225 --> 01:24:24,891
Brother...

1539
01:24:25,391 --> 01:24:28,891
Will you have coffee?

1540
01:24:33,683 --> 01:24:37,683
Brother, can I ask you something?

1541
01:24:38,183 --> 01:24:40,100
Ask.

1542
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:44,725
Let it be...I'll feel really small if I do.

1543
01:24:45,225 --> 01:24:48,100
You can think about it, But you can't ask?

1544
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:55,641
You see, brother... Happy is one in a million.

1545
01:24:56,141 --> 01:24:58,683
And I am not saying this because I love her.

1546
01:24:59,183 --> 01:25:01,766
She is!

1547
01:25:02,266 --> 01:25:04,891
Once someone gets to know her...

1548
01:25:05,391 --> 01:25:09,558
...They can't help themselves from falling in love with her.

1549
01:25:10,058 --> 01:25:15,850
That day...when you were talking about her...

1550
01:25:16,350 --> 01:25:20,641
I realized you've gotten to know her

1551
01:25:21,141 --> 01:25:24,641
So I thought to ask.

1552
01:25:27,266 --> 01:25:30,183
Do you want an answer or the truth?

1553
01:25:30,683 --> 01:25:34,183
Let the truth be... just give me an answer.

1554
01:25:41,100 --> 01:25:44,141
You know Madhubala...

1555
01:25:44,641 --> 01:25:48,308
..used to be my dad's favorite.

1556
01:25:48,808 --> 01:25:54,850
He would always tease mom saying she's not as beautiful as Madhubala.

1557
01:25:55,350 --> 01:25:57,641
Mom would laugh it off.

1558
01:25:58,141 --> 01:26:00,933
Do you know why?

1559
01:26:01,433 --> 01:26:03,516
Because Madhubala was also one in a million.

1560
01:26:04,016 --> 01:26:06,183
Everyone loved her.

1561
01:26:06,683 --> 01:26:10,183
Did it make a difference?

1562
01:26:11,891 --> 01:26:14,308
What really matters...

1563
01:26:14,808 --> 01:26:18,308
...is who Madhubala actually loved.

1564
01:26:35,100 --> 01:26:38,141
For the next five days we are responsible...

1565
01:26:38,641 --> 01:26:40,266
...for the safety of entire Lahore.

1566
01:26:40,766 --> 01:26:43,891
Entire Lahore? - Of course...entire Lahore.

1567
01:26:44,391 --> 01:26:47,891
And whoever is not with me can step back now.

1568
01:26:58,100 --> 01:26:59,183
We've received information...

1569
01:26:59,683 --> 01:27:05,933
...that a very dangerous, cunning and a lowlife Indian spy...

1570
01:27:06,433 --> 01:27:08,808
...can enter our city any moment.

1571
01:27:09,308 --> 01:27:11,975
So we must apprehend him at any cost.

1572
01:27:12,475 --> 01:27:15,891
Alive or...

1573
01:27:16,391 --> 01:27:17,891
Alive.

1574
01:27:18,391 --> 01:27:24,225
Are you all with me? - Yes Sir.

1575
01:27:24,725 --> 01:27:27,600
You just have to take custody, let me handle the rest.

1576
01:27:28,100 --> 01:27:30,058
Fine, you can handle the rest.

1577
01:27:30,558 --> 01:27:32,766
Just a minute. Just a minute.

1578
01:27:33,266 --> 01:27:37,975
Calm down, papa. We'll find her. - That's not it.

1579
01:27:38,475 --> 01:27:39,933
I've been controlling it from Amritsar.

1580
01:27:40,433 --> 01:27:41,266
I'll just go relieve myself.

1581
01:27:41,766 --> 01:27:43,391
Fine, go, go... - Yes.

1582
01:27:43,891 --> 01:27:45,433
Don't forget to read the signboards. - Of course.

1583
01:27:45,933 --> 01:27:49,433
Don't get in the wrong place. It is a foreign country

1584
01:27:54,433 --> 01:27:57,933
Just a minute...

1585
01:28:06,725 --> 01:28:08,516
Are you Bagga?

1586
01:28:09,016 --> 01:28:10,016
Daman Singh Bagga!

1587
01:28:10,516 --> 01:28:12,433
Did Rasheed send you? - Yes-Yes, let's go.

1588
01:28:12,933 --> 01:28:16,266
Wait, let the old man return. - What old man?

1589
01:28:16,766 --> 01:28:17,391
The girl's father.

1590
01:28:17,891 --> 01:28:18,475
He's gone to the toilet, will be right back.

1591
01:28:18,975 --> 01:28:22,475
Hands up!

1592
01:28:25,100 --> 01:28:27,058
Kayloola, you.

1593
01:28:27,558 --> 01:28:30,558
In a police costume? - It's not a costume, it's my uniform.

1594
01:28:31,058 --> 01:28:32,891
You fool, mind your manners...

1595
01:28:33,391 --> 01:28:36,475
...you're standing in front of ASP Usman Afridi.

1596
01:28:36,975 --> 01:28:38,225
You humiliated us a lot, didn't you?

1597
01:28:38,725 --> 01:28:41,100
Now give us a chance to show some hospitality too.

1598
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:41,975
Yes but...all this? - Amjad.

1599
01:28:42,475 --> 01:28:42,725
Sir.

1600
01:28:43,225 --> 01:28:45,975
Throw these two fools into the police jeep. - Sir.

1601
01:28:46,475 --> 01:28:47,266
Hey but...

1602
01:28:47,766 --> 01:28:48,891
Just listen! - ofcourse we'll listen

1603
01:28:49,391 --> 01:28:52,891
Don't you respect your guests? - We'll show you

1604
01:28:56,475 --> 02:57:52,866
Yes?

1605
01:28:56,891 --> 01:29:00,350
Mr. Junior, Bagga has been arrested.

1606
01:29:00,850 --> 01:29:03,558
Along with the other idiot who came to receive him.

1607
01:29:04,058 --> 01:29:05,850
Brilliant, Afridi! - I know Mr. Junior

1608
01:29:06,350 --> 01:29:07,266
Throw Bagga behind bars...

1609
01:29:07,766 --> 01:29:10,558
...and find out where happy is from the other idiot.

1610
01:29:11,058 --> 01:29:14,766
Bagga's been arrested.

1611
01:29:15,266 --> 01:29:18,016
Great. Great news. - Yeah...

1612
01:29:18,516 --> 01:29:21,266
I'll handle the venue preparations along with Ishtiyaq sir.

1613
01:29:21,766 --> 01:29:23,516
Let me know when you find out about Happy.

1614
01:29:24,016 --> 01:29:26,558
I'll join you guys.

1615
01:29:27,058 --> 01:29:30,558
Zoya... Thank you.

1616
01:29:38,891 --> 01:29:44,266
Your Mr.Junior...is the owner of that fraud music company, right? - Yes.

1617
01:29:44,766 --> 01:29:46,433
In all these years I spent in politics...

1618
01:29:46,933 --> 01:29:50,100
...I never imagined that our neighboring country will be responsible...

1619
01:29:50,600 --> 01:29:54,100
...for sabotaging your brother's wedding.

1620
01:29:55,891 --> 01:29:58,100
My brother?

1621
01:29:58,600 --> 01:29:59,766
You never do your job properly...

1622
01:30:00,266 --> 01:30:01,350
Did you fill diesel in the van?

1623
01:30:01,850 --> 01:30:05,183
Brother, both their phones are unreachable.

1624
01:30:05,683 --> 01:30:07,516
Unreachable? Let me see.

1625
01:30:08,016 --> 01:30:10,516
Brother, tell Jalal to keep the parcel

1626
01:30:11,016 --> 01:30:13,808
Shaukat just took her to the bathroom, she slammed the door so hard...

1627
01:30:14,308 --> 01:30:17,308
Shut your radio programme!

1628
01:30:17,808 --> 01:30:20,266
They can't just disappear in thin air.

1629
01:30:20,766 --> 01:30:23,183
I think this is a big game.

1630
01:30:23,683 --> 01:30:27,058
ISI...RAW level.

1631
01:30:27,558 --> 01:30:28,766
Allah have mercy.

1632
01:30:29,266 --> 01:30:30,975
Mister, have you seen this girl? - No!

1633
01:30:31,475 --> 01:30:33,475
Mister, have you seen this girl? - No!

1634
01:30:33,975 --> 01:30:38,975
Mister, have you seen this girl? - No!

1635
01:30:39,475 --> 01:30:42,516
Mister, have you seen this girl? - Who is she?

1636
01:30:43,016 --> 01:30:44,016
She is my daughter.

1637
01:30:44,516 --> 01:30:47,475
She came from Amritsar to Lahore by mistake.

1638
01:30:47,975 --> 01:30:49,891
God knows what trouble she is in?

1639
01:30:50,391 --> 01:30:51,641
It's all my fault.

1640
01:30:52,141 --> 01:30:53,266
There's no point in getting disappointed, mister.

1641
01:30:53,766 --> 01:30:56,433
Have you filed a missing report of her? - No, I haven't.

1642
01:30:56,933 --> 01:30:58,266
Here, have some tea.

1643
01:30:58,766 --> 01:31:00,641
Filing a missing report won't do you any good either.

1644
01:31:01,141 --> 01:31:02,766
You'll need the help of someone influential

1645
01:31:03,266 --> 01:31:05,516
Someone who's got connections in the embassy or the consulate.

1646
01:31:06,016 --> 01:31:08,600
Who are such guys?

1647
01:31:09,100 --> 01:31:11,891
He is.

1648
01:31:12,391 --> 01:31:13,600
Wasim Akram?

1649
01:31:14,100 --> 01:31:16,558
No, on the TV.

1650
01:31:17,058 --> 01:31:18,016
Mr. Javed Ahmed.

1651
01:31:18,516 --> 01:31:19,475
He is the ex-Governor.

1652
01:31:19,975 --> 01:31:21,975
I see...where can I find him?

1653
01:31:22,475 --> 01:31:23,308
It's not that easy to meet him.

1654
01:31:23,808 --> 01:31:25,183
You'll need to get an appointment first.

1655
01:31:25,683 --> 01:31:29,183
Can you give me his address? - Of course.

1656
01:31:31,683 --> 01:31:35,183
Here you go.

1657
01:31:38,350 --> 01:31:41,850
Here you go, mister. - Thank you.

1658
01:31:45,808 --> 01:31:49,308
Here's the money for the tea. - Thank you.

1659
01:31:55,016 --> 01:31:58,058
Hey...who was he? What was he asking you?

1660
01:31:58,558 --> 01:31:59,558
He was an Indian.

1661
01:32:00,058 --> 01:32:01,183
And was asking for Javed Ahmed Sir's address.

1662
01:32:01,683 --> 01:32:02,225
And you gave it to him.

1663
01:32:02,725 --> 01:32:04,933
Of course, after all he paid for the cup of tea.

1664
01:32:05,433 --> 01:32:08,850
Unlike you. - You fool!

1665
01:32:09,350 --> 01:32:12,141
Any identification? - He was from India Sir.

1666
01:32:12,641 --> 01:32:15,058
He looked well-trained.

1667
01:32:15,558 --> 01:32:18,850
And sir, there was a pouch under his shirt.

1668
01:32:19,350 --> 01:32:20,891
Pouch? - Yes, sir. Pouch.

1669
01:32:21,391 --> 01:32:23,308
I fear that Mr. Ahmed's life...

1670
01:32:23,808 --> 01:32:25,558
Immediately make a sketch of that man.

1671
01:32:26,058 --> 01:32:28,600
And send it to every police station in the city.

1672
01:32:29,100 --> 01:32:30,641
Put up his posters all over the city.

1673
01:32:31,141 --> 01:32:34,641
I want this man! - Yes, sir.

1674
01:32:37,558 --> 01:32:40,308
All well, Afridi? - Don't know, Mr. Junior.

1675
01:32:40,808 --> 01:32:44,308
Out of the pan...and into the fire.

1676
01:32:47,475 --> 01:32:49,225
"This Indian has entered Pakistan..."

1677
01:32:49,725 --> 01:32:53,266
"...with the intentions of attacking the ex-governor Javed Ahmed?"

1678
01:32:53,766 --> 01:32:55,308
Read ahead.

1679
01:32:55,808 --> 01:32:58,308
"If you see him anywhere, inform us immediately."

1680
01:32:58,808 --> 01:33:00,808
Now who is he?

1681
01:33:01,308 --> 01:33:03,600
Father? - Father? Whose father?

1682
01:33:04,100 --> 01:33:04,725
Happy's father.

1683
01:33:05,225 --> 01:33:08,183
Why would Happy's father want to kill Javed uncle?

1684
01:33:08,683 --> 01:33:09,350
I don't know...

1685
01:33:09,850 --> 01:33:12,600
Is this news correct? - His posters have been put up all over the city.

1686
01:33:13,100 --> 01:33:14,141
Something's definitely wrong.

1687
01:33:14,641 --> 01:33:15,766
Why would Happy's father want to kill your father?

1688
01:33:16,266 --> 01:33:18,308
We'll deal with this later, let's finish this job first.

1689
01:33:18,808 --> 01:33:22,308
Address. - This imbecile will tell us.

1690
01:33:35,391 --> 01:33:36,183
Listen up...

1691
01:33:36,683 --> 01:33:38,016
Make a team of two.

1692
01:33:38,516 --> 01:33:39,391
You go left... and you enter from South.

1693
01:33:39,891 --> 01:33:41,016
Amjad, you lead them - Yes, sir.

1694
01:33:41,516 --> 01:33:42,100
Stay with him.

1695
01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:42,808
Come on...come on.

1696
01:33:43,308 --> 01:33:46,808
Follow me, quietly. - Yes, sir.

1697
01:33:54,725 --> 01:33:58,808
Brother, if they've kept Happy here...

1698
01:33:59,308 --> 01:34:02,808
...where are their men?

1699
01:34:06,100 --> 01:34:07,725
Are you sure this is the place?

1700
01:34:08,225 --> 01:34:09,225
How many guards inside?

1701
01:34:09,725 --> 01:34:10,516
How would I know?

1702
01:34:11,016 --> 01:34:13,183
I think this is a very bad idea.

1703
01:34:13,683 --> 01:34:15,933
How will we get that Indian out of a Police station? - Shut up.

1704
01:34:16,433 --> 01:34:17,058
Come out. Come out.

1705
01:34:17,558 --> 01:34:18,600
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

1706
01:34:19,100 --> 01:34:20,933
Do you want to get me killed?

1707
01:34:21,433 --> 01:34:22,100
"Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!"

1708
01:34:22,600 --> 01:34:23,891
What is this? Your aunt's wedding party?

1709
01:34:24,391 --> 01:34:26,183
Walk quietly.

1710
01:34:26,683 --> 01:34:30,183
Carefully.

1711
01:34:33,100 --> 01:34:34,975
Come here.

1712
01:34:35,475 --> 01:34:39,100
Go and create a diversion. Go on.

1713
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:43,100
Quietly or you'll get a beating...

1714
01:34:51,016 --> 01:34:55,600
Didn't we pass from here before?

1715
01:34:56,100 --> 01:34:57,433
Zoya, where are you wandering?

1716
01:34:57,933 --> 01:34:59,016
You will get lost.

1717
01:34:59,516 --> 01:35:02,308
They don't even have a fan... how could Happy be staying here?

1718
01:35:02,808 --> 01:35:03,933
That's true... metal everywhere.

1719
01:35:04,433 --> 01:35:07,933
Come on.

1720
01:35:10,850 --> 01:35:14,350
Hey, what are you doing?

1721
01:35:17,975 --> 01:35:19,891
Just a minute, brother. The boy's getting the key.

1722
01:35:20,391 --> 01:35:21,683
Hurry up.

1723
01:35:22,183 --> 01:35:25,683
Open it up.

1724
01:35:44,475 --> 01:35:47,975
This one.

1725
01:35:50,266 --> 01:35:53,100
Which one of you is Rasheed? - That's me.

1726
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:54,600
You couldn't come yourself to the bus depot?

1727
01:35:55,100 --> 01:35:55,933
First the girl's father ran away...

1728
01:35:56,433 --> 01:35:58,600
...and that fool you sent, sided with the police in a second.

1729
01:35:59,100 --> 01:35:59,766
But you told me nothing about the father...

1730
01:36:00,266 --> 01:36:03,766
Get in.

1731
01:36:06,225 --> 01:36:09,100
Come on.

1732
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:11,808
Be careful.

1733
01:36:12,308 --> 01:36:15,808
Rascals have kept her quite inside.

1734
01:36:23,016 --> 01:36:23,808
No need to even try, son.

1735
01:36:24,308 --> 01:36:25,100
Put your hands up.

1736
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:27,600
Zoya, have you lost it?

1737
01:36:28,100 --> 01:36:32,308
Happy! Happy! Happy!

1738
01:36:32,808 --> 01:36:35,516
Happy, how are you?

1739
01:36:36,016 --> 01:36:39,516
Oh yeah.

1740
01:36:42,683 --> 01:36:44,600
Take it off. Slowly.

1741
01:36:45,100 --> 01:36:46,058
Are you blind?

1742
01:36:46,558 --> 01:36:47,600
I've been trying to call you for so long.

1743
01:36:48,100 --> 01:36:49,933
"Rascals have kept her quite inside."

1744
01:36:50,433 --> 01:36:51,600
Stupid.

1745
01:36:52,100 --> 01:36:53,725
Sorry.

1746
01:36:54,225 --> 01:36:57,725
Your Guddu is stupid.

1747
01:37:03,058 --> 01:37:06,558
You're okay?

1748
01:37:14,100 --> 01:37:15,183
Everything is going to be alright.

1749
01:37:15,683 --> 01:37:18,225
Shall we go, Mr. Junior?

1750
01:37:18,725 --> 01:37:22,225
Its better if we leave.

1751
01:37:27,725 --> 01:37:30,183
We were having so much fun.

1752
01:37:30,683 --> 01:37:35,725
Tomorrow after Happy leaves everything will become boring again.

1753
01:37:36,225 --> 01:37:37,475
Right?

1754
01:37:37,975 --> 01:37:40,516
You two can come to Amritsar whenever you like.

1755
01:37:41,016 --> 01:37:42,225
I'll take you around Amritsar.

1756
01:37:42,725 --> 01:37:44,975
Right, Guddu. - And why Amritsar, We all should go to Shimla.

1757
01:37:45,475 --> 01:37:46,058
It's a really amazing place.

1758
01:37:46,558 --> 01:37:50,058
Mr. Bhatti, our travel agent will sort everything. - Yeah.

1759
01:37:53,641 --> 01:37:56,725
Can your father kill someone? - Of course he can.

1760
01:37:57,225 --> 01:37:58,683
Who do you want him to kill? - No one.

1761
01:37:59,183 --> 01:38:01,516
Your father's here to kill Bilal's father.

1762
01:38:02,016 --> 01:38:02,225
What?

1763
01:38:02,725 --> 01:38:03,600
Father's here? - Yes.

1764
01:38:04,100 --> 01:38:05,058
In Lahore? - Yes.

1765
01:38:05,558 --> 01:38:07,183
Not just father, Bagga's here too. - What?

1766
01:38:07,683 --> 01:38:07,975
Yes.

1767
01:38:08,475 --> 01:38:09,933
Bagga's in jail, but father's free.

1768
01:38:10,433 --> 01:38:13,933
But what is my father doing here? - I don't know

1769
01:38:17,933 --> 01:38:19,725
Brother, it's confirmed.

1770
01:38:20,225 --> 01:38:23,725
She ran away.

1771
01:38:34,933 --> 01:38:40,808
Run Happy...run.

1772
01:38:41,308 --> 01:38:44,808
I will find you again.

1773
01:39:03,850 --> 01:39:07,558
What happened? Huh!

1774
01:39:08,058 --> 01:39:10,433
Nothing.

1775
01:39:10,933 --> 01:39:12,516
What's wrong, Bilal Ahmed?

1776
01:39:13,016 --> 01:39:17,141
Your walk has lost its confidence, your words are not sure of its meaning!

1777
01:39:17,641 --> 01:39:21,350
You've spent half your life blaming your father.

1778
01:39:21,850 --> 01:39:26,016
And you want to spend the rest blaming me?

1779
01:39:26,516 --> 01:39:30,183
No, I don't want your favor.

1780
01:39:30,683 --> 01:39:33,683
And if you're wondering what will happen to Zoya...

1781
01:39:34,183 --> 01:39:36,516
...then let me clear that doubt as well.

1782
01:39:37,016 --> 01:39:40,600
When you were selected for the College team...

1783
01:39:41,100 --> 01:39:45,183
...I drank and danced all night.

1784
01:39:45,683 --> 01:39:49,183
If you're happy with someone else, I'll still be doing that.

1785
01:39:57,266 --> 01:40:00,766
I love you.

1786
01:40:03,558 --> 01:40:07,558
But it's my problem.

1787
01:40:08,058 --> 01:40:12,183
The day you see tears in my eyes, Bilal Ahmed...

1788
01:40:12,683 --> 01:40:15,600
...change my name.

1789
01:40:16,100 --> 01:40:17,308
Madam.

1790
01:40:17,808 --> 01:40:21,808
That brother sent me.

1791
01:40:22,308 --> 01:40:23,891
Why don't you keep something new?

1792
01:40:24,391 --> 01:40:27,933
People get bored of seeing the same items every day.

1793
01:40:28,433 --> 01:40:31,933
Right?

1794
01:40:37,350 --> 01:40:45,183
"O kind soul...I thank you."

1795
01:40:45,683 --> 01:40:53,183
"O companion...I've fallen in love."

1796
01:40:53,683 --> 01:40:57,183
"There's no cure for my ailment."

1797
01:40:57,683 --> 01:41:01,558
"My God is my witness."

1798
01:41:02,058 --> 01:41:05,766
"Now you must decide..."

1799
01:41:06,266 --> 01:41:10,225
"If I don't live with you... then what's the point of living at all."

1800
01:41:10,725 --> 01:41:17,725
"You...you...you...only you... just you...yes you..."

1801
01:41:18,225 --> 01:41:18,600
"I am in love with..."

1802
01:41:19,100 --> 01:41:22,600
"You...you...you...only you... just you...yes you..."

1803
01:41:43,516 --> 01:41:47,225
"I was often unaware of things."

1804
01:41:47,725 --> 01:41:51,475
"My heart was never a poet."

1805
01:41:51,975 --> 01:41:55,516
"You have decided my fate... otherwise..."

1806
01:41:56,016 --> 01:41:59,600
"...I was never destined for any love."

1807
01:42:00,100 --> 01:42:01,725
"It's all your grace..."

1808
01:42:02,225 --> 01:42:03,850
"...that I've forsaken all faith and religion."

1809
01:42:04,350 --> 01:42:05,933
"Keep doing it..."

1810
01:42:06,433 --> 01:42:08,016
"Keep tormenting me some more."

1811
01:42:08,516 --> 01:42:12,183
"I couldn't control my heart no matter how hard I tried."

1812
01:42:12,683 --> 01:42:16,308
"I just handed it over to you."

1813
01:42:16,808 --> 01:42:20,933
"Whether you destroy it or save it."

1814
01:42:21,433 --> 01:42:25,350
"You can do as you wish with my love."

1815
01:42:25,850 --> 01:42:30,725
"You...you...you...only you... just you...yes you..."

1816
01:42:31,225 --> 01:42:34,725
"I am in love with..."

1817
01:42:45,350 --> 01:42:49,183
"My heart's in a big dilemma."

1818
01:42:49,683 --> 01:42:53,350
"My desires are still being stubborn."

1819
01:42:53,850 --> 01:42:57,475
"The world will be upset with me."

1820
01:42:57,975 --> 01:43:01,516
"But who cares about the world."

1821
01:43:02,016 --> 01:43:03,558
"And you will go home"

1822
01:43:04,058 --> 01:43:05,600
"All we have is this moment."

1823
01:43:06,100 --> 01:43:07,891
"It's not the destination..."

1824
01:43:08,391 --> 01:43:09,975
"...it's the journey that I love."

1825
01:43:10,475 --> 01:43:14,225
"The borders won't like..."

1826
01:43:14,725 --> 01:43:18,225
"...when two vagabond heart become one."

1827
01:43:18,725 --> 01:43:22,975
"I am a bird and you're a star."

1828
01:43:23,475 --> 01:43:26,975
"I'll choose my sky and you choose yours."

1829
01:43:32,016 --> 01:43:37,183
"You...you...you...only you... just you...yes you..."

1830
01:43:37,683 --> 01:43:39,725
"I am in love with..."

1831
01:43:40,225 --> 01:43:43,725
"You...you...you...only you...just you...yes you..."

1832
01:43:54,350 --> 01:44:00,475
Have I said too much? No. Way too much.

1833
01:44:00,975 --> 01:44:03,850
But you said the truth.

1834
01:44:04,350 --> 01:44:06,433
I am going to drop Guddu to the hotel.

1835
01:44:06,933 --> 01:44:08,141
Get some rest.

1836
01:44:08,641 --> 01:44:10,891
We need to get them married tomorrow...

1837
01:44:11,391 --> 01:44:14,183
...and I need you by my side.

1838
01:44:14,683 --> 01:44:18,558
Because that's what I want.

1839
01:44:19,058 --> 01:44:22,558
I love you.

1840
01:44:41,683 --> 01:44:44,141
Bilal. Yes, father?

1841
01:44:44,641 --> 01:44:46,016
Is everything okay? What's the hurry?

1842
01:44:46,516 --> 01:44:47,516
Well, I am leaving for the venue.

1843
01:44:48,016 --> 01:44:50,225
It's my trial today, and if everything goes well...

1844
01:44:50,725 --> 01:44:53,516
...it will change the history of Pakistan.

1845
01:44:54,016 --> 01:44:56,016
Father, I am running late. I'll see you there.

1846
01:44:56,516 --> 01:45:00,016
Thanks.

1847
01:45:04,308 --> 01:45:05,350
No, sir... - Leave me.

1848
01:45:05,850 --> 01:45:07,350
No, sir... - You cannot go in.

1849
01:45:07,850 --> 01:45:08,975
Mister-Mister!

1850
01:45:09,475 --> 01:45:10,975
He's already gone.

1851
01:45:11,475 --> 01:45:13,141
You guys are unbelievable.

1852
01:45:13,641 --> 01:45:15,600
Stop. Stop.

1853
01:45:16,100 --> 01:45:19,600
Follow that white car. Quickly.

1854
01:45:24,933 --> 01:45:25,766
Yes, Afridi.

1855
01:45:26,266 --> 01:45:31,308
Sir, I have very bad news for you. When have you ever given me good news?

1856
01:45:31,808 --> 01:45:32,475
Wait!

1857
01:45:32,975 --> 01:45:34,058
Mister.

1858
01:45:34,558 --> 01:45:36,183
Hold on.

1859
01:45:36,683 --> 01:45:39,766
Overtake him. Come on.

1860
01:45:40,266 --> 01:45:43,100
Why isn't he listening?

1861
01:45:43,600 --> 01:45:45,516
What a strange man!

1862
01:45:46,016 --> 01:45:48,433
It's unbelievable, Afridi. I was saying the same thing, sir.

1863
01:45:48,933 --> 01:45:49,266
It really is unbelievable.

1864
01:45:49,766 --> 01:45:52,350
Happy's father is following me.

1865
01:45:52,850 --> 01:45:56,183
These bunch of Indians have created a stir all over Pakistan.

1866
01:45:56,683 --> 01:45:57,225
The same thing has happened here.

1867
01:45:57,725 --> 01:45:58,600
Forget that.

1868
01:45:59,100 --> 01:46:01,350
I am heading towards the park, to give him the slip.

1869
01:46:01,850 --> 01:46:04,141
That fool's talking on the phone while driving.

1870
01:46:04,641 --> 01:46:06,308
Mister... - Come there immediately and arrest him.

1871
01:46:06,808 --> 01:46:09,433
Of course. What park, sir?

1872
01:46:09,933 --> 01:46:10,891
I don't know, Afridi.

1873
01:46:11,391 --> 01:46:14,308
It's close to my home. I get it. I get it.

1874
01:46:14,808 --> 01:46:17,016
Amjad, drive to Shalimar Park.

1875
01:46:17,516 --> 01:46:18,433
Stay on the line Sir

1876
01:46:18,933 --> 01:46:19,850
Old man can be dangerous.

1877
01:46:20,350 --> 01:46:21,516
He's slipping away

1878
01:46:22,016 --> 01:46:23,100
Drive faster

1879
01:46:23,600 --> 01:46:27,100
Mister!

1880
01:46:32,975 --> 01:46:33,975
Stop!

1881
01:46:34,475 --> 01:46:35,766
Stop! Stop!

1882
01:46:36,266 --> 01:46:38,350
Mister! Mister!

1883
01:46:38,850 --> 01:46:41,183
Here you go.

1884
01:46:41,683 --> 01:46:42,516
Wait, mister.

1885
01:46:43,016 --> 01:46:46,516
Nobody listens in this country!

1886
01:47:03,016 --> 01:47:03,641
Stop!

1887
01:47:04,141 --> 01:47:07,641
Stop-Stop!

1888
01:47:17,350 --> 01:47:18,891
Hello. Hello, yes sir.

1889
01:47:19,391 --> 01:47:20,308
I am in the park. Where are you?

1890
01:47:20,808 --> 01:47:21,850
Congratulations, I am in the park as well.

1891
01:47:22,350 --> 01:47:23,558
Sir, please take a look around you.

1892
01:47:24,058 --> 01:47:27,100
How can anyone find you in this huge park with so many trees?

1893
01:47:27,600 --> 01:47:30,225
Do you see the Cyprus trees? Cyprus?

1894
01:47:30,725 --> 01:47:33,766
What's Cyprus called in Urdu? It's called my head.

1895
01:47:34,266 --> 01:47:35,475
How did you join the police?

1896
01:47:35,975 --> 01:47:38,891
It's the same trees like the ones in front of the Taj Mahal.

1897
01:47:39,391 --> 01:47:39,600
Taj Mahal?

1898
01:47:40,100 --> 01:47:40,808
Taj Mahal!

1899
01:47:41,308 --> 01:47:42,975
I know...you haven't been there.

1900
01:47:43,475 --> 01:47:44,100
You must have seen photos.

1901
01:47:44,600 --> 01:47:45,350
Of course I did.

1902
01:47:45,850 --> 01:47:46,558
I wish Taj Mahal was in Pakistan.

1903
01:47:47,058 --> 01:47:48,391
Hey...that tree is right in front of me.

1904
01:47:48,891 --> 01:47:52,391
Where...

1905
01:47:54,600 --> 01:47:55,766
The old man's disappeared.

1906
01:47:56,266 --> 01:47:59,891
See, sir...I got here and the old man disappeared.

1907
01:48:00,391 --> 01:48:01,558
I was getting worried, Mr. Junior.

1908
01:48:02,058 --> 01:48:03,725
It's a good thing he ran away. What nice?

1909
01:48:04,225 --> 01:48:05,891
The hoardings of the wedding are all over the city.

1910
01:48:06,391 --> 01:48:09,058
If the old man gets there, it'll be a disaster.

1911
01:48:09,558 --> 01:48:11,183
Disaster... exactly, even I was saying that.

1912
01:48:11,683 --> 01:48:12,350
What were you saying?

1913
01:48:12,850 --> 01:48:14,975
There's a small problem, Mr. Junior.

1914
01:48:15,475 --> 01:48:20,766
You see last night... Bagga ran away.

1915
01:48:21,266 --> 01:48:22,225
What?

1916
01:48:22,725 --> 01:48:24,475
Bagga escaped? When? How?

1917
01:48:24,975 --> 01:48:26,933
And you're telling me now? That is why called you, sir...

1918
01:48:27,433 --> 01:48:29,183
Shut up, Afridi.

1919
01:48:29,683 --> 01:48:35,600
If Bagga gets there, then I will kill you instead.

1920
01:48:36,100 --> 01:48:37,225
You get there.

1921
01:48:37,725 --> 01:48:40,391
With Happy's deportation papers and Guddu's ticket. - Okay.

1922
01:48:40,891 --> 01:48:42,558
Get the army, the police... everyone on the job!

1923
01:48:43,058 --> 01:48:44,016
No one should get a whiff of this!

1924
01:48:44,516 --> 01:48:48,016
Just find Bagga.

1925
01:48:52,683 --> 01:48:56,725
Get the Army, the police... and no one should get a whiff of this. .

1926
01:48:57,225 --> 01:49:01,391
What kind of order was that?

1927
01:49:01,891 --> 01:49:04,475
Shall we go?

1928
01:49:04,975 --> 01:49:08,475
You're looking nice.

1929
01:49:12,225 --> 01:49:15,850
Let's go.

1930
01:49:16,350 --> 01:49:21,766
It'll happen this way, out here...I never imagined this.

1931
01:49:22,266 --> 01:49:26,183
But you...you won my heart, brother.

1932
01:49:26,683 --> 01:49:30,516
You are amazing.

1933
01:49:31,016 --> 01:49:35,308
You see Guddu, there's...been a small problem.

1934
01:49:35,808 --> 01:49:37,058
It's okay.

1935
01:49:37,558 --> 01:49:38,933
You cannot create problems.

1936
01:49:39,433 --> 01:49:41,183
You...

1937
01:49:41,683 --> 01:49:47,766
I mean you have done it, brother.

1938
01:49:48,266 --> 01:49:51,766
You see...kind of...you know...

1939
01:49:56,016 --> 01:49:57,350
Bagga escaped. I...

1940
01:49:57,850 --> 01:49:58,183
What?

1941
01:49:58,683 --> 01:49:59,891
Bagga escaped!

1942
01:50:00,391 --> 01:50:02,475
Bagga escaped? How did he escape?

1943
01:50:02,975 --> 01:50:06,600
And what do you mean kind of escaped? He must have fully escaped no?

1944
01:50:07,100 --> 01:50:10,225
And if he's escaped, he'll get here.

1945
01:50:10,725 --> 01:50:12,766
Brother, you have...

1946
01:50:13,266 --> 01:50:16,766
You have done it!

1947
01:50:21,975 --> 01:50:24,558
Superb. Beautiful.

1948
01:50:25,058 --> 01:50:27,350
I am truly amazing. You?

1949
01:50:27,850 --> 01:50:32,975
Yes, me...who did your makeup? Point.

1950
01:50:33,475 --> 01:50:34,600
Thank you.

1951
01:50:35,100 --> 01:50:38,350
No, thank you. What for?

1952
01:50:38,850 --> 01:50:40,100
Bilal is right.

1953
01:50:40,600 --> 01:50:43,683
You make everyone Like yourself... 'Happy'.

1954
01:50:44,183 --> 01:50:46,350
That's why.

1955
01:50:46,850 --> 01:50:49,391
Rifat. Yes.

1956
01:50:49,891 --> 01:50:51,100
Don't say no.

1957
01:50:51,600 --> 01:50:55,891
Gift this to Huriya on your behalf.

1958
01:50:56,391 --> 01:50:58,850
If it were anyone else, I'd never accept it...

1959
01:50:59,350 --> 01:51:01,516
..but whenever I see this necklace around Huriya's neck

1960
01:51:02,016 --> 01:51:04,308
I'll keep thinking of Happy

1961
01:51:04,808 --> 01:51:07,016
What are you saying, brother? I know Bagga.

1962
01:51:07,516 --> 01:51:08,100
He's a scoundrel.

1963
01:51:08,600 --> 01:51:09,475
He's done things that you...

1964
01:51:09,975 --> 01:51:10,975
I mean I've witnessed them. Greetings.

1965
01:51:11,475 --> 01:51:14,975
He's like a termite, eats you from inside. - Greetings.

1966
01:51:28,516 --> 01:51:30,100
Happy. Yes.

1967
01:51:30,600 --> 01:51:35,891
There's been a small problem. What?

1968
01:51:36,391 --> 01:51:38,808
I... Bagga escaped.

1969
01:51:39,308 --> 01:51:41,933
What? How did he escape?

1970
01:51:42,433 --> 01:51:44,308
And you're saying it's a small problem.

1971
01:51:44,808 --> 01:51:45,600
What are you doing?

1972
01:51:46,100 --> 01:51:47,058
Shit!

1973
01:51:47,558 --> 01:51:48,475
Guddu, we have to go

1974
01:51:48,975 --> 01:51:49,266
We'll deal with this later.

1975
01:51:49,766 --> 01:51:53,266
We'll deal with this later. You wait, I'll deal with this later.

1976
01:51:53,766 --> 01:51:56,266
Go there.

1977
01:51:56,766 --> 01:51:58,266
Greetings. How are you?

1978
01:51:58,766 --> 01:51:59,141
All okay.

1979
01:51:59,641 --> 01:52:00,558
Greetings. Greetings.

1980
01:52:01,058 --> 01:52:01,350
Come, son.

1981
01:52:01,850 --> 01:52:03,058
Sir, please proceed towards the dais.

1982
01:52:03,558 --> 01:52:04,683
There's a security threat.

1983
01:52:05,183 --> 01:52:09,016
Security threats are nothing new for the members of Ahmed's family.

1984
01:52:09,516 --> 01:52:10,141
You're right.

1985
01:52:10,641 --> 01:52:13,808
Ma'am. I've brought the priest.

1986
01:52:14,308 --> 01:52:15,725
Priest, did you get everything?

1987
01:52:16,225 --> 01:52:18,558
I've brought everything, but I haven't done anything like this before.

1988
01:52:19,058 --> 01:52:19,891
We haven't done anything like this either.

1989
01:52:20,391 --> 01:52:20,850
Please take a seat.

1990
01:52:21,350 --> 01:52:24,308
Sit sit...No one has done this in the history of Pakistan!

1991
01:52:24,808 --> 01:52:25,725
Congratulations.

1992
01:52:26,225 --> 01:52:27,183
Congratulations.

1993
01:52:27,683 --> 01:52:29,891
To you too!

1994
01:52:30,391 --> 01:52:32,766
You're not needed inside. Stay here.

1995
01:52:33,266 --> 01:52:34,308
Congratulations.

1996
01:52:34,808 --> 01:52:37,308
And remember...don't let Bagga inside. Of course.

1997
01:52:37,808 --> 01:52:41,308
Congratulations.

1998
01:52:51,891 --> 01:52:55,391
Mister, can I meet these two gentlemen here?

1999
01:52:58,433 --> 01:53:00,600
Yes, mister. Of course. Go in.

2000
01:53:01,100 --> 01:53:04,600
Father?

2001
01:53:15,183 --> 01:53:15,475
Where's Guddu?

2002
01:53:15,975 --> 01:53:19,308
What are you doing here? Brother Usman, father was right here.

2003
01:53:19,808 --> 01:53:20,350
What do you mean? Old man.

2004
01:53:20,850 --> 01:53:22,391
But he was with you. He left long ago.

2005
01:53:22,891 --> 01:53:24,058
You want to get yourself killed.

2006
01:53:24,558 --> 01:53:25,850
Come on.

2007
01:53:26,350 --> 01:53:29,850
Father was...

2008
01:53:44,225 --> 01:53:45,516
Why are so many people following father?

2009
01:53:46,016 --> 01:53:46,683
I don't know...you don't know...

2010
01:53:47,183 --> 01:53:50,683
What do you care?

2011
01:53:53,100 --> 01:53:54,891
Where were you?

2012
01:53:55,391 --> 01:53:57,016
Take a seat.

2013
01:53:57,516 --> 01:54:01,016
Take off, priest. Start.

2014
01:54:02,933 --> 01:54:03,183
Sir.

2015
01:54:03,683 --> 01:54:05,141
Sir. Sir. Sir. Mister.

2016
01:54:05,641 --> 01:54:07,725
Sir. Sir...he's the man I saw in the market.

2017
01:54:08,225 --> 01:54:08,475
Catch him.

2018
01:54:08,975 --> 01:54:09,475
What's wrong?

2019
01:54:09,975 --> 01:54:14,600
I have come to meet Javed Ahmed.

2020
01:54:15,100 --> 01:54:18,600
He must be around. Where else could he go?

2021
01:54:24,100 --> 01:54:25,558
Guddu, Afridi

2022
01:54:26,058 --> 01:54:27,766
Bagga's here!

2023
01:54:28,266 --> 01:54:30,058
Who the hell fired a gun?

2024
01:54:30,558 --> 01:54:32,058
Scoundrel you've come too far!

2025
01:54:32,558 --> 01:54:34,141
Brother you step aside, I'll take care of him.

2026
01:54:34,641 --> 01:54:34,975
You go get married...

2027
01:54:35,475 --> 01:54:35,808
I will manage this.

2028
01:54:36,308 --> 01:54:38,225
Quickly.

2029
01:54:38,725 --> 01:54:41,808
Priest, he's the real groom.

2030
01:54:42,308 --> 01:54:43,891
Stay away.

2031
01:54:44,391 --> 01:54:45,308
Cover me.

2032
01:54:45,808 --> 01:54:49,308
Cover me. Cover me. - Cover me, also!

2033
01:54:52,516 --> 01:54:55,266
Happy you like running so much! Why are you slow today?

2034
01:54:55,766 --> 01:54:59,683
Faster!

2035
01:55:00,183 --> 01:55:02,600
Hurry up, priest.

2036
01:55:03,100 --> 01:55:04,933
Afridi, take these two to the airport.

2037
01:55:05,433 --> 01:55:05,975
And don't stop anywhere.

2038
01:55:06,475 --> 01:55:08,766
Take them to the airport.

2039
01:55:09,266 --> 01:55:09,975
Hurry up, let's go!

2040
01:55:10,475 --> 01:55:13,600
It's done, it's done.

2041
01:55:14,100 --> 01:55:15,600
Guddu! Happy! Greetings, father.

2042
01:55:16,100 --> 01:55:18,975
Bless you! - He has a gun!

2043
01:55:19,475 --> 01:55:21,350
Dear, hold up

2044
01:55:21,850 --> 01:55:25,350
Rashid!

2045
01:55:27,558 --> 01:55:28,766
I'm here! You should escape..

2046
01:55:29,266 --> 01:55:32,766
Dear.

2047
01:55:35,100 --> 01:55:37,808
Mister...it's me. - Who is that? - Happy's father!

2048
01:55:38,308 --> 01:55:39,891
He doesn't listen at all.

2049
01:55:40,391 --> 01:55:42,475
Sir, the engine is on ...

2050
01:55:42,975 --> 01:55:46,475
Harpreet! This is unbelievable.

2051
01:55:56,683 --> 01:56:00,183
Get out of the way, moron!

2052
01:56:02,433 --> 01:56:04,808
Drive father, brother Usman. I am...don't worry.

2053
01:56:05,308 --> 01:56:10,475
Bagga's right behind us. Let Bagga come, we're in Pakistan.

2054
01:56:10,975 --> 01:56:13,725
And Mr. Junior has complete faith in me.

2055
01:56:14,225 --> 01:56:16,391
Straight, keep driving straight brother!

2056
01:56:16,891 --> 01:56:17,266
Madam...

2057
01:56:17,766 --> 01:56:18,225
Happy madam.

2058
01:56:18,725 --> 01:56:21,266
There's something I wanted to tell you.

2059
01:56:21,766 --> 01:56:24,225
I'll always have a regret because of your love story.

2060
01:56:24,725 --> 01:56:26,600
I wish we had such love stories in Pakistan.

2061
01:56:27,100 --> 01:56:30,266
But the truth is...your love story blossomed in Pakistan.

2062
01:56:30,766 --> 01:56:32,058
Brother, we haven't succeeded yes.

2063
01:56:32,558 --> 01:56:33,683
Look ahead.

2064
01:56:34,183 --> 01:56:38,475
It will. It will. It will. Drive faster.

2065
01:56:38,975 --> 01:56:40,475
Then I went to the tea-stall.

2066
01:56:40,975 --> 01:56:42,725
He gave me his address.

2067
01:56:43,225 --> 01:56:46,558
This guy in the white car.

2068
01:56:47,058 --> 01:56:51,183
Mister...hey mister, listen to me.

2069
01:56:51,683 --> 01:56:52,725
We'll go straight then take a turn...

2070
01:56:53,225 --> 01:56:54,933
...and then take a left and then from the circle...

2071
01:56:55,433 --> 01:56:56,433
Why are you giving me directions?

2072
01:56:56,933 --> 01:56:58,183
I can see the car, you idiot!

2073
01:56:58,683 --> 01:57:01,475
It's me...I am from India, no one's ready to listen.

2074
01:57:01,975 --> 01:57:03,433
Brother, why take the same route as them?

2075
01:57:03,933 --> 01:57:05,600
They are all heading to the airport after all.

2076
01:57:06,100 --> 01:57:08,183
Take a left. You're right.

2077
01:57:08,683 --> 01:57:09,350
Then take a left! Here?

2078
01:57:09,850 --> 01:57:11,808
Yes...

2079
01:57:12,308 --> 01:57:15,183
Bilal, Bagga turned left. Rascal, he's taking the shortcut.

2080
01:57:15,683 --> 01:57:16,600
Why aren't we taking the shortcut?

2081
01:57:17,100 --> 01:57:18,100
We're not in a race, Zoya!

2082
01:57:18,600 --> 01:57:21,266
Doesn't anyone hear you out in Pakistan?

2083
01:57:21,766 --> 01:57:24,600
What... - What's happening? - What's happening?

2084
01:57:25,100 --> 01:57:26,308
You catch thieves in this.

2085
01:57:26,808 --> 01:57:29,433
Cars don't usually breakdown in Pakistan!

2086
01:57:29,933 --> 01:57:31,266
Come on. Come on.

2087
01:57:31,766 --> 01:57:32,850
Stop her. Stop her. She will run away again.

2088
01:57:33,350 --> 01:57:34,391
At least we'll reach before you.

2089
01:57:34,891 --> 01:57:38,391
She'll run away!

2090
01:57:44,725 --> 01:57:45,600
Hurry up.

2091
01:57:46,100 --> 01:57:48,391
I said hurry up.

2092
01:57:48,891 --> 01:57:50,225
Here here.. Gate no.7

2093
01:57:50,725 --> 01:57:51,350
Stop the vehicle!

2094
01:57:51,850 --> 01:57:53,183
Where do you think you're going?

2095
01:57:53,683 --> 01:57:54,350
Sorry! Sorry! Sorry! - This is a high security area

2096
01:57:54,850 --> 01:57:55,725
Stop-stop. We're here.

2097
01:57:56,225 --> 01:57:57,683
Sorry! Sorry! - Take this away...

2098
01:57:58,183 --> 01:58:01,058
Here, go now. No, brother Usman.

2099
01:58:01,558 --> 01:58:03,100
We won't leave without meeting Bilal and Zoya.

2100
01:58:03,600 --> 01:58:06,600
But Bagga...your father. We'll have to confront them in Amritsar.

2101
01:58:07,100 --> 01:58:07,558
I am through with running away now.

2102
01:58:08,058 --> 01:58:09,808
You guys... Mr. Junior will have me killed! - Happy.

2103
01:58:10,308 --> 01:58:11,850
Happy...

2104
01:58:12,350 --> 01:58:17,350
Look, Happy... don't create a problem now.

2105
01:58:17,850 --> 01:58:20,350
You're my wife now.

2106
01:58:20,850 --> 01:58:22,808
You see...

2107
01:58:23,308 --> 01:58:28,725
...Bilal had started liking you. What?

2108
01:58:29,225 --> 01:58:32,808
Are you crazy? Be quiet and listen to me for once.

2109
01:58:33,308 --> 01:58:35,058
I am only saying this because...

2110
01:58:35,558 --> 01:58:36,975
...I cannot take you back with this burden.

2111
01:58:37,475 --> 01:58:38,891
I am not like that.

2112
01:58:39,391 --> 01:58:44,225
But he's...a great guy.

2113
01:58:44,725 --> 01:58:48,225
Everything he did...

2114
01:58:50,725 --> 01:58:51,016
Harpreet!

2115
01:58:51,516 --> 01:58:51,808
Hey... Look!

2116
01:58:52,308 --> 01:58:53,850
Listen old man! - Happy...

2117
01:58:54,350 --> 01:58:54,725
Take his gun.

2118
01:58:55,225 --> 01:58:56,225
Shut up, inspector.

2119
01:58:56,725 --> 01:58:57,891
What kind of a country is this?

2120
01:58:58,391 --> 01:59:01,891
No one listens to you until you don't point a gun.

2121
01:59:06,475 --> 01:59:09,391
I came to tell my daughter...

2122
01:59:09,891 --> 01:59:15,891
...that the guy I chose for her was completely wrong.

2123
01:59:16,391 --> 01:59:19,391
But the guy you chose...

2124
01:59:19,891 --> 01:59:20,766
...he's right

2125
01:59:21,266 --> 01:59:24,766
I like him. Very good.

2126
01:59:31,683 --> 01:59:33,433
Love you, dad.

2127
01:59:33,933 --> 01:59:37,933
Wow! This is amazing!

2128
01:59:38,433 --> 01:59:39,350
Bless you.

2129
01:59:39,850 --> 01:59:42,058
Give them your blessings and send them off.

2130
01:59:42,558 --> 01:59:46,058
We'll get you your bus tickets for tomorrow...

2131
01:59:57,308 --> 02:00:00,808
Thank you, Zoya.

2132
02:00:02,225 --> 02:00:04,600
Take care of yourself. You too.

2133
02:00:05,100 --> 02:00:08,600
We'll miss you.

2134
02:00:31,016 --> 02:00:34,516
And Mr. Bilal...you're supposed to be the next Jinnah, right?

2135
02:00:47,516 --> 02:00:52,058
Bilal, I'll take care of Madhubala.

2136
02:00:52,558 --> 02:00:55,308
And Usman bro, get your car fixed. Sure!

2137
02:00:55,808 --> 02:00:58,183
Zoya, I love you too.

2138
02:00:58,683 --> 02:01:02,600
I love you.

2139
02:01:03,100 --> 02:01:05,058
What's the big deal, sir?

2140
02:01:05,558 --> 02:01:08,475
Even Dilip Kumar couldn't get Madhubala.

2141
02:01:08,975 --> 02:01:11,266
He told you too?

2142
02:01:11,766 --> 02:01:16,016
All of Pakistan knows about it.

2143
02:01:16,516 --> 02:01:20,016
Come, Bilal.

2144
02:01:30,850 --> 02:01:34,350
What was she whispering in your ears?

2145
02:01:45,225 --> 02:01:49,308
Let's go... -But Bagga!

2146
02:01:49,808 --> 02:01:53,891
And our brother has made a big name for Punjab even in Pakistan.

2147
02:01:54,391 --> 02:01:57,891
He's been victorious.

2148
02:02:00,891 --> 02:02:07,850
Well, I cannot take all the credit alone.

2149
02:02:08,350 --> 02:02:16,183
I only went there to bring these two lovers back home safe and sound.

2150
02:02:16,683 --> 02:02:20,808
This isn't your brother's victory alone.

2151
02:02:21,308 --> 02:02:25,183
This is Happy's victory!

2152
02:02:25,683 --> 02:02:28,516
This is your victory!

2153
02:02:29,016 --> 02:02:30,391
And this is Amritsar's victory.

2154
02:02:30,891 --> 02:02:34,391
Clap!

2155
02:02:36,100 --> 02:02:41,183
Listen you fool... will they still vote for me?

2156
02:02:41,683 --> 02:02:43,725
Of course they will.

2157
02:02:44,225 --> 02:02:48,225
So what if Happy's got that goat, we've got the sympathy vote!
