1
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:34,050
Through leaves of apathy...

2
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:36,130
I spy the fierce bark of my generation.

3
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,210
A wretched blob of uppers and downers.

4
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:43,610
Chasing phantoms in fancy suits.

5
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:47,840
The tree grows limp.

6
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,170
Cloudy skies cluster overhead.

7
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:21,120
Seriously?

8
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:25,980
I know.

9
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:27,630
Hey! Where’s Niz?

10
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,260
Could you get him please?

11
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,330
Niz? Yeah, just one second.

12
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,010
Figs!

13
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,780
How’s it hanging bro’?

14
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,440
Precariously, man.

15
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:33,670
Thanks yo’!

16
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,330
Oh Jay meet Figs.

17
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,440
Figs, Jay.

18
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,670
Hello Figs.

19
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,460
Interesting name.

20
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,690
Yeah. It’s short for Figaro.

21
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:52,300
Er... like the opera?

22
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:52,910
Yes...

23
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:54,400
Mozart.

24
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:57,770
My parents.
They’re lovers of the opera.

25
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,250
Okay then...

26
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:02,020
That’s new.

27
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:02,720
Thank you.

28
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,750
Awesome stuff dude!

29
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,150
It's your stuff, dude!

30
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,270
Oh yes! Correct.

31
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:17,500
Niz! What the...

32
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:21,400
Where have you been?
I’ve been waiting like forever!

33
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:28,620
I am a traveler, lost in a storm.

34
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:34,150
All I want to do is to love you.

35
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:38,950
You are my light, my inspiration.

36
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:44,980
You are my light, my inspiration.

37
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:50,520
Maggie, I love you!

38
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:57,200
Wow! What awful poetry!

39
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,500
Figs...

40
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:01,450
A photographer and a poet!

41
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:03,190
Fantastic.

42
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:04,750
Good catch, Maggie.

43
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:10,110
Figs. How's it going?

44
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,190
Yeah... well...

45
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:15,060
...pillaging, licentiousness and
drunken debauchery.

46
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,120
You know, the usual.

47
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:18,900
And you, sir?

48
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:21,270
Just chilling.

49
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:26,130
(Whispering)

50
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:32,460
So... We’ll be back!

51
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,370
Oh and Figs...

52
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,010
Take it easy on the drinks yo’!

53
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:42,650
Okay yo’...

54
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:43,650
Bye.

55
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,240
Mishra! Tell me something…

56
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,050
Just roll another joint.

57
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:58,570
Yes, indeed!

58
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,380
- Maggie.
- Hey!

59
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:05,470
- Happy Birthday!
- Thank you.

60
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,740
You don’t smoke?

61
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:27,750
No. Is that a problem?

62
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,340
Yes, yes, yes...

63
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,400
No, no, no...

64
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:59,490
Why do guys always do that?

65
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:07,260
Do what?

66
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:12,390
You know? Have a smoke after...

67
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:18,000
How many guys have you known?

68
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:21,770
So… Why are you sitting here?

69
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,210
Excuse me?

70
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,270
If you’ve got something to say....

71
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,380
...just say it.

72
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,560
Apologies. What’s your deal?

73
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:40,390
Excuse me?

74
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:42,510
You heard me. What’s your deal?

75
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,620
Figs, you don’t know Jay?

76
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:48,290
Jayshri Bose! President, LSR Debsoc.

77
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,890
Debate! How cool! Wow...

78
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:56,800
Why don't you give us a rundown
of that debate speech?

79
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,250
So Figaro, what’s your deal?

80
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,350
Mine?

81
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:06,310
I'm just in love with hash.

82
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,040
Yeah man!

83
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:14,680
Why so serious, Mr.?

84
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,500
Nothing.

85
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:30,050
I was just thinking...

86
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:37,830
I might have to leave
town for a few days.

87
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,250
I’m going to head to the hills.

88
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:46,480
Why? What’s up?

89
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,430
Some work. Photography work.

90
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,960
Cool. So take me with you!

91
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:59,970
No! It’s work.

92
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:01,860
No! It’s work...

93
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,970
Come on! Don’t be silly.

94
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,480
Hey! What are you doing?

95
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:11,930
You’ll break it, baby! Stop it.

96
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:14,510
Of course not.
I know how to use this.

97
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:16,760
No. Stop. Don’t do that.

98
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:18,390
Come on. Smile.

99
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:22,140
I said stop!

100
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:25,590
Come on... Niz!

101
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,720
Don’t make me use force!

102
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:31,750
Force is good.

103
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,620
So Jay, how’s everything in college?

104
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:50,580
Great.

105
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,590
In fact I’m working
on a new assignment.

106
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,700
We’re doing a case
study on political refugees.

107
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:59,110
Niz and I, we have this
old school friend, Thupten.

108
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,860
He has become quite the
spokesman for a free Tibet.

109
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:03,040
Nice.

110
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:05,720
It’s a cause worth fighting for.

111
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,730
Listen to this bull shit, man!

112
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:11,450
Wow...

113
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:15,940
Guess everyone’s entitled to an opinion...

114
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,900
Even the drunk village idiot!

115
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,280
Who do you think you are? Che Guevara?

116
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:22,530
No, you’re not!

117
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:24,430
Not even close.

118
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,110
You’re just a silly, delusional,
bourgeois girl with a stick up her ass.

119
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,340
Who do you think you are?

120
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:35,640
You’re just a self-involved, vacuous...

121
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,130
...Freak.

122
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,840
What pretentious use of English!

123
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:43,040
Listen. What’s your name?

124
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,870
Jay, right? Jay?

125
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:45,990
Listen, Jay.

126
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:51,430
I know the world’s a fucked up place
but I’m also smart enough to know...

127
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:53,840
...that there’s nothing that you or I...

128
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:56,740
...sitting here in this
beautiful posh farm house...

129
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,650
...can do about it.

130
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,350
So I’m just going to sit
here and smoke this doob...

131
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:03,600
...while the world can go fuck itself.

132
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,470
You’re an ass hole.

133
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,790
Yeah... I am!

134
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,310
Drop the yuppie act, will you? Get real.

135
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:12,770
Here she is folks!

136
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:14,890
Revolutionary Bose to the rescue.

137
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,890
Fighting evil and doing good.

138
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,020
How cute.

139
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:18,960
You’re right.

140
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:21,870
It is cute.

141
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:30,000
What? Jay? Jay?

142
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:34,700
Figs! Figs! Are you okay, bro’?

143
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:36,830
It’s all good man. It’s all good.

144
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,200
Everyone’s a critic.

145
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:45,790
Figs? Figs?

146
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:04,970
Figs Bhardwaj... the things you do.

147
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,300
Good morning!

148
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,860
(Music)

149
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:20,430
Auto!

150
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:39,370
Light and shadow are now in harmony,

151
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:42,200
The news spreads in every direction,

152
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:45,090
Commotion in these winds as well,

153
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:47,960
Light and shadow are now together.

154
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,620
The commotion of the world tells you,

155
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:53,630
Be intoxicated with your wishes,

156
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,430
Content in their thoughts,

157
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,940
The woes behind these smiles.

158
00:12:58,940 --> 00:12:58,950
The woes behind these smiles.
That bird which desires only smoke,

159
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:10,530
That bird which desires only smoke,

160
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:19,150
A great deal of time has passed by,

161
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:21,770
What is right and what is wrong,

162
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:24,670
There exists no limit, yet.

163
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:27,520
Look they’re really exhausted

164
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:30,220
Your heart tells you to dance carefree

165
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:33,140
Let’s sail the ship of smoke

166
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:38,430
Where no one ever travels to,
let’s go there

167
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:43,510
That bird which desires only smoke

168
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,090
Thank you.

169
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:21,920
I bought them fresh from the Ritz,
Mr. Gupta. Just for the two of you!

170
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:23,700
The Ritz?

171
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:24,600
Yes.

172
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,730
We had our last kitty party there.

173
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:28,690
A resounding success.

174
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,300
I’m sure it was!

175
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:33,560
Why don’t you join us
the next time, Vandana!

176
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:36,530
We’re having a bake sale at the club.

177
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:38,590
Come early for cocktails.

178
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:40,590
I certainly will.

179
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:41,700
Will I not be invited?

180
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,080
Look. He wants to come as well.

181
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:45,830
Hey Figaro! Where have you been?

182
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,880
Come sit with us...

183
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:49,670
We’ve been waiting for
you for over an hour, dear.

184
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,420
Sorry guys! Apologies...

185
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,860
There was an emergency at
Maggie’s place. It was kind of a...

186
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:54,950
What? What happened?

187
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:58,350
This girl, this friend of
Maggie’s I think she was...

188
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:01,050
...she was having this
existential crisis and...

189
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:04,190
...I stayed up all night
consoling the poor creature.

190
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,780
Figaro! What rubbish! Now come on...

191
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:10,440
Figaro, Figaro. Meet Mr Gupta...

192
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:13,670
Hello Figaro. Pleasure meeting you.

193
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:15,080
And Mrs Gupta...

194
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:15,830
Hi.

195
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:24,390
Figaro. Your dad tells me
you’re interested in corporate law?

196
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,970
Well actually...

197
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:30,130
No problem.
Come over tomorrow!

198
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:32,860
We’ll create a position of
a research assistant for you!

199
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,240
No problems at all.

200
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:35,760
No, no, no. Not tomorrow.

201
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,020
He has to finish his
application to Harvard first.

202
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:41,000
How about the day after? At 3PM?

203
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:43,360
Harvard, eh? That’s great!

204
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:46,640
We’re actually also trying
for an MBA you know...

205
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,830
Then he can always
help Arun in his shipping.

206
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:51,210
But somehow I feel that...

207
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:54,150
...law is far more appealing.
Don’t you think?

208
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:55,750
Definitely. Definitely.

209
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,600
He will have a fantastic
experience with us.

210
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,930
Then he’ll go to Harvard...

211
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:05,150
...and then he’ll come back and
join us as a junior partner. Isn’t it?

212
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,620
- Figaro. Figaro.
- Figaro.

213
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,570
Wouldn’t that be wonderful?

214
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,040
Talking of shipping, Arun.
How’s the business going?

215
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:15,800
Well, not too terrible...

216
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,070
It’s this bloody! Oh I’m sorry.

217
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:23,570
It’s this recession, I’ve had
to cut back by like 12.77%...

218
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,490
I’ve had to get rid of some of my cargo
ships and cancelled so many contracts.

219
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:29,960
It’s all this ridiculous taxation.

220
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:32,290
I mean what are the...
what are the government folks doing?

221
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:35,640
Forcing us back into the socialist
hell hole that we just climbed out of.

222
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:37,510
I mean... just bloody ridiculous.

223
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:39,510
How’s the tea?

224
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:40,530
Hmm Lovely.

225
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:43,250
Darjeeling Oolong.

226
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,730
First flush.

227
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,990
A cup a day and all your
sorrows dissipate, Mr Gupta.

228
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:08,980
Figs!

229
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:11,130
Your mother…

230
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,370
...no, not you!

231
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:14,750
Actually, you…

232
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,000
Where are you?

233
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,920
Yeah, well, I’m just grabbing a bite

234
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,010
in Hauz Khas Village.

235
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:22,450
Listen! Let’s go get
some chocolate fudge.

236
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:23,180
Right now?

237
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:24,450
Yes! Now…

238
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:27,340
I’m picking you up, okay? Bye.

239
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:31,380
This is but the beginning!

240
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,140
The battle is yet to come…

241
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,760
Look, you love writing…

242
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,450
This is what you want to do!

243
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:50,800
Why do you need to go along with it?

244
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,970
Maggie...

245
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:56,400
...you’re just not going to get it!

246
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,420
It’s my parents...

247
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,720
...they’re just from another planet.

248
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,250
Figs,

249
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,270
I thought you were better than this.

250
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:10,270
Psycho parents aren’t exactly a novelty.

251
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:12,320
We’ve all been there.

252
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,000
Come up with something better!

253
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,510
Yeah, well, I guess I’m not
such a good writer after all.

254
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:20,850
Listen, Maggie,
tell me something…

255
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:23,320
What’s the scene with this guy?

256
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:26,140
Niz?

257
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:27,490
I mean...

258
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:30,070
...so far, so good, I guess.

259
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:33,150
It’s just that…

260
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:35,670
Don’t get me wrong,

261
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,370
I mean, I love him.

262
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:40,070
He’s great and
he’s so talented and...

263
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:43,070
It’s just sometimes...

264
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:46,390
...you know, he doesn’t
want to go out anywhere...

265
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,720
...doesn’t want to spend
on anything. It’s a bit…

266
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,310
Maybe that’s because he’s
not loaded like you Maggie.

267
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:52,060
Shut up.

268
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:54,290
Drop the yuppie act, okay?

269
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,620
Keep it real.

270
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:56,840
What?

271
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:58,730
Nothing, nothing.

272
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,310
Well, at least you’re leaving
me conscious this time around.

273
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,460
Sorry, I have to go.

274
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,460
We’ll chill some other time.

275
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:10,570
You need a ride?

276
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:13,620
No I think I’ll just
hang here for a bit.

277
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,390
Cool.

278
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,200
Go, go, go play footsie or
whatever it is you do.

279
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,490
Oh, and I forgot,

280
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,940
I’m out of hash.
Can you give me some?

281
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,610
Think I’m out as well, sorry.

282
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,940
Shit. Okay, so...

283
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:37,140
...ask Mishra.

284
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:39,070
Yeah I’ll do that.

285
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,600
If I can find him that is.

286
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,310
Okay, bye.

287
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:45,660
Maggie!

288
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,460
Yeah?

289
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:49,900
Nothing, nothing…
See you!

290
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:51,630
Bye.

291
00:19:55,876 --> 00:19:57,876
(Music)

292
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:11,460
In a darkened land,

293
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:13,800
He comes and goes,

294
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:17,140
In black and white,

295
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:18,990
He’ll pick you up,

296
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:22,860
When you’re feeling down,

297
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:25,310
The man with no heart,

298
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:30,710
He runs this town...

299
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:35,730
The Man with a Million Drugs,

300
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:40,310
He’s the Man with a Million Drugs.

301
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:50,670
Oye Figs!

302
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:52,830
Sit...

303
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,180
Mishra!

304
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:57,830
How are you?

305
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:58,520
Same old.

306
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:06,580
So...

307
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,710
Yeah so....

308
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,960
Last night was an experience, yeah?

309
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:16,210
Yeah well, guess you could say that.

310
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:19,520
I mean you and Jay really hit it off?

311
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:22,240
What? Are you crazy?

312
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:27,190
No. Anyway I wanted to know
if I could score some hash?

313
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:29,900
Any chance I can get some... hash?

314
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:33,810
Hash. Hash...

315
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,880
Oh hash...

316
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:38,290
Do you have some?

317
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,990
Yes... certainly!

318
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:48,680
Hash. Hash...

319
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:01,810
Figs, looks like I’m out.

320
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:04,520
You’re joking, right?

321
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:07,440
No, no, no, I’m serious.

322
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,560
Okay tell me, in the meantime...

323
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:14,850
Could I interest you in some keta?

324
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:20,390
I just scored it from our good friends over at
the Government of India veterinary institute.

325
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:23,840
But what’s this, man?

326
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,290
Ketamine. Horse tranquilizer.

327
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:32,620
Yeah, well...

328
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,350
No cream, man?

329
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:36,900
No.

330
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:40,390
Just check if you have any cream.

331
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:42,570
M Cream.

332
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,600
M Cream, man.
The best hash in the world.

333
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:49,050
One puff and nirvana.

334
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:51,320
Sweet enough for Shiva himself.

335
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,720
It’s gone. It’s gone
my friend. It’s finished.

336
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:58,270
It’s returned to the
pantheon of the destroyer.

337
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:05,310
Alas. In that case
we mortals lie bereft.

338
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,880
This is a dire situation!

339
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:17,260
And round and
round and round it goes.

340
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:25,350
Life is a dream for the wise,
a game for the fool,

341
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:32,500
a comedy for the rich,
a tragedy for the poor.

342
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:37,660
Life, how does it matter anyway?

343
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:42,090
It’s just a brothel.

344
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:45,680
And round and
round and round it goes.

345
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:56,540
Arun, get up! We have to
go for lunch to the Khots’.

346
00:23:56,930 --> 00:24:00,480
You know what they’re
like... sticky. Come on.

347
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,600
Oh dear. I’m ready, I’m ready.

348
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:15,550
You know, Arun...

349
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:17,990
I’ve been thinking,
we should take Figs with us.

350
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:22,290
What the hell for? Let the young lad
do some work for a change.

351
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:24,640
You remember Irina?

352
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:25,600
Who?

353
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,370
Mr and Mrs Khots little girl.

354
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:28,380
Ah.

355
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:34,180
It just so happens she’s come back from
the US and she’s not so little anymore.

356
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:34,950
Oh.

357
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:38,440
I think she would make
a great match for Figs.

358
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,000
A very suitable couple.

359
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:43,530
But I thought young Figs was besotted
with, what’s her name, Maggie.

360
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:45,480
Forget about Maggie.

361
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,140
(Car Honk)

362
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:58,370
(Car Honk)

363
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:00,080
What was that noise?

364
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:03,710
Figs!

365
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:06,440
What’s going on?

366
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:07,520
Hey guys.

367
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:10,540
Where do you think you’re going?

368
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:13,950
I’m just heading to the hills.
I’ll be gone for a few days.

369
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:16,000
What? Why?

370
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:17,320
Road trip.

371
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:20,340
Road trip? What are you
talking about? Are you serious!

372
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,970
Yeah, I should have
told you this earlier but...

373
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,240
You know, this is all very
dramatic and awkward and stuff...

374
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,340
So I’m just going to take your leave.

375
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:29,050
See you guys!

376
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:29,810
Figs!

377
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:34,880
You’ve got to stop running if you really
want to find what you’re looking for.

378
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:43,650
Arun! Do something!

379
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:46,770
Vandana! Do What?

380
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:55,370
Yes I’ll be chasing all you to the street,

381
00:25:56,830 --> 00:26:01,510
I’ll be chasing; I’ll be racing,

382
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:06,630
You to the street,

383
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:10,650
To the street...

384
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:12,690
See you later!

385
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,040
Hello.

386
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:17,250
Hey! Come on. Let’s go, man.

387
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:19,060
Whoa.

388
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:22,370
Oh Figs. You’ve met Jay, right?

389
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,330
She went to school with Niz.

390
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:27,070
Ah.

391
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:27,810
Hi.

392
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:29,640
You guys know each other?

393
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:35,700
No... Thankfully.

394
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:38,400
Oh.

395
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,120
Oh.

396
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:47,030
Maggie, I didn’t know she was coming.

397
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:48,050
Figs, relax, man.

398
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:50,910
- So what’s the big deal?
- Maggie, man...

399
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:55,650
I hope you have enough booze
at least. I just got one bottle with me.

400
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,850
Yeah. It’s at the back.

401
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,590
- Niz, can you just check?
- Yeah, yeah...

402
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:01,310
At your service!

403
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:08,770
So... Two bottles of vodka.

404
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:14,290
Coke, vodka and more vodka.

405
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,470
Maggie?

406
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,190
What? I like vodka.

407
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:19,680
No scotch?

408
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:20,580
Nope.

409
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:22,860
That must be corrected.

410
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:23,560
Yup.

411
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,120
Scotch? Alright.

412
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:28,980
You drink scotch?

413
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:31,140
Yes.

414
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:35,110
That’s nice. Cool, me too.

415
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:39,090
We’ll pick it up on the way. Come on...

416
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:39,770
Let’s go.

417
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:40,580
Getting late...

418
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:43,810
Ready guys?

419
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:45,850
- You’ll tell me later.
- Yeah I will.

420
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:49,060
(Music)

421
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:55,040
On the road again.

422
00:27:55,640 --> 00:28:01,210
None are more hopelessly enslaved than
those who falsely believe they are free.

423
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:07,010
And there we were,
children of chaos and anarchy.

424
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,270
Escaping into the endless unknown.

425
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,820
We are free.

426
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:14,910
On the road again.

427
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,070
Butter chicken and bread?

428
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:21,990
Sir, it’s over.

429
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,000
Okay.

430
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,060
Mughlai chicken and bread?

431
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:28,830
Sir, it’s over.

432
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:30,590
Is anything available?

433
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:33,750
- Sir, you tell me!
- No you tell me!

434
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,010
Chicken fry...

435
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,630
- And bread?
- Yes, sir.

436
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:37,190
Done.

437
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:39,420
With vegetables on the side.

438
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:40,550
- Okay.
- Thank you.

439
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:43,870
So where are we spending the night?

440
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:47,400
Oh... At this abandoned guest
house just off the highway.

441
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:50,590
My uncle owns it, he’s a minister.

442
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:53,080
Abandoned?

443
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:58,730
Yeah. I think it used to be Indira Gandhi’s
guest house or something like that.

444
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:01,280
But no one lives there anymore.

445
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,450
Haunted house.

446
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:09,010
Shut up, Niz. Don’t kid around.

447
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:12,690
I’m scared of ghosts.

448
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:14,510
Yeah, ghosts are so scary.

449
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,880
Anyway screw that.

450
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:19,890
Mababajagal here we come!

451
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:23,160
I can smell the cream and it smells good.

452
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:25,230
What is he talking about?

453
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:26,870
We’re going to Dharamsala.

454
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:30,220
What the hell is Mababajagal?

455
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:31,410
Dharamsala?

456
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:35,720
Er Jay, right...

457
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:42,500
Mababajagal is this mythical magical place.

458
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:45,860
The source of M Cream,
this mythical magical hash.

459
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:48,770
And... we’re all going to go look for it.

460
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:51,350
And Figs...

461
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:54,880
We are going to Dharamsala first.

462
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,440
Jay and I’ve got an old friend there, Thupten.

463
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,670
Plus she’s doing a write-up on Tibetans...

464
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:01,560
...in exile...

465
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:04,440
...and I’m taking photographs.

466
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:06,590
Remember I told you?

467
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,500
The assignment...

468
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,450
What?

469
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:13,780
What are you looking at me for?

470
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:17,420
Will you grow up?

471
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:19,840
Yeah...

472
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:21,160
Maybe I will.

473
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:23,920
When you stop being a
self-righteous, little bimbo!

474
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,490
Dude, relax.

475
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,880
It’s not her fault.

476
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:33,480
I think I’ve diagnosed
your problem, Figaro.

477
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,390
Really, what is it?

478
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:38,250
You’re just a spoilt, selfish brat...

479
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,930
...who thinks of nothing
other than his own petty existence.

480
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:43,740
And you’re just a
hypocritical little bimbo.

481
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:45,010
Hypocritical?

482
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:46,160
Oh yeah?

483
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:48,020
People like you...

484
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,660
...spout shit about this cause...

485
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:51,450
...and that cause!

486
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:52,100
And you sit here,

487
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:52,940
do nothing about it.

488
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:55,660
It’s almost funny if it weren’t so pathetic.

489
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,430
I do what I do...

490
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,140
...because it affects me.

491
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,160
Okay?

492
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:04,590
It affects me when there’s a
random terrorist attack in my city.

493
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:08,910
It affects me when the government
goes on and on about our rising GDP...

494
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:11,270
...when a majority of our
people are still poor.

495
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:14,010
And it affects me that no
one gives a damn about Tibet.

496
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:16,580
Because there’s no
oil there, there’s only people.

497
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,760
It affects me so fuck you!

498
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:19,920
It affects you?

499
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,580
Miss, I hate to say it...

500
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:24,330
...but you’re a walking cliche.

501
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,770
Come on... Unbelievable.

502
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:31,620
Figs.

503
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:34,410
What’s your problem, man?

504
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:41,910
Drama.

505
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,250
I love it.

506
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:48,720
And for all those locks and keys,

507
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:52,620
Yeah, we leave them all behind,

508
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,870
For the leaves and for the trees,

509
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:03,640
For the countless lullabies.

510
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:04,390
Spooky.

511
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:06,930
Shut up.

512
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:14,400
Sleeping arrangements. Shotgun, Niz
and I will take the big bedroom.

513
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:16,530
Jay, you can have the other one.

514
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:20,590
- And Figs, the couch is all yours.
- Yay!

515
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:23,530
Niz, make the drinks quickly!

516
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,420
That’s what I’m doing.

517
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:28,990
Yuck! This place is so dirty.

518
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:31,450
This place is beautiful.

519
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:35,990
I am so exhausted.

520
00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:39,310
Here you go!

521
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:40,450
Thank you.

522
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:43,900
And here you go...

523
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:51,870
A toast to us... a toast to us...

524
00:32:52,900 --> 00:33:00,090
...and to the dangerous promise
of the unknown road ahead.

525
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:04,150
I’ll drink to that!

526
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:05,170
Cheers.

527
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:14,560
So...

528
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:18,130
Do you guys do these
road trip things often?

529
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:19,470
You think?

530
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:24,500
Getting Niz to go someplace is like getting
Anna Hazare to clean up corruption.

531
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:26,690
Easier said than done.

532
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:30,420
Well unlike some people
I have a earn a living.

533
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:33,980
What you gonna’ do?
Working class blues...

534
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:36,270
What’s with that attitude?

535
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:37,970
Nothing...

536
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:45,820
It’s just that you seem to forget that...
we did go to Jim Corbett over winter break.

537
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,320
For, like, two days!

538
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:51,490
And please that’s because Rishi was
going through this animal planet phase.

539
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,740
It doesn’t count.

540
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,020
Who’s Rishi?

541
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:58,970
Rishi Rastogi. We used
to hangout a lot, earlier...

542
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:04,410
He came out. Yeah...
became quite an issue.

543
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:07,970
His dad was furious, threw
him out and all that stuff.

544
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,510
That’s sad...

545
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:13,830
...we modern Indians aren’t as
open minded as we pretend to be.

546
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:14,900
Anyway...

547
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:19,490
He moved in with this guy
somewhere in North Campus and...

548
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:22,040
...I guess we drifted apart.

549
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:25,360
Seconds please.

550
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:28,770
That was quick!

551
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:33,810
So should we play some music?

552
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,050
I’m on it.

553
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:38,300
Much obliged.

554
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:39,830
Miss Bose.

555
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:39,880
Miss Bose.
Come on, sexy.
Show me some moves!

556
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:44,340
Come on, sexy.
Show me some moves!

557
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:45,070
Er. Okay.

558
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:02,590
What are you doing?

559
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,810
Nothing.

560
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,050
Do you write?

561
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:09,700
No.

562
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:12,500
Well, it looks like you’re writing.

563
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:18,470
Okay, well, yeah...
A little bit.

564
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:23,390
You know, Jay?

565
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:24,510
Hmm...

566
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:26,270
I was meaning to
talk to you about this...

567
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:34,760
...well, look, I’m... I’m sorry, alright.
I know I was a little hard on you earlier.

568
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:38,890
Is that a smile?

569
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:41,290
No.

570
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:42,920
Looks like one.

571
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:44,520
Looks can be deceiving.

572
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:45,620
Uh huh.

573
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:49,960
Actually, Figs...

574
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:58,040
I’ve given it some thought and
we’re not so different, you and I.

575
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:00,680
You’re drunk already?

576
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:05,130
No! Well maybe a little...

577
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:10,470
Thank god. Can you imagine
being sober around those two?

578
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:12,690
No, I can’t...

579
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:20,050
I digress, the point is that we both
view the world in very similar ways.

580
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:20,560
Uh huh.

581
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:23,570
Scary as that sounds.

582
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:26,530
I mean, think about it... It’s a mess!

583
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:32,570
On the one hand we’re the fastest
growing economy, the biggest democracy,

584
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,800
poster boy for all things awesome...

585
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:36,720
And on the other hand?

586
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:43,830
Where was I?

587
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,200
The other hand...

588
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:46,990
Right...

589
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,120
Fucking chaos dude.

590
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:56,910
And you get that. Like me.

591
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,470
Oh yeah, I do?

592
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:00,520
Yeah...

593
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:07,870
Yeah, a lot of people don’t.
Or at least they don’t seem to.

594
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:10,220
Do you know what I mean?

595
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,260
Good night, guys.

596
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:13,720
Good night.

597
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,330
Till the morning comes.

598
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:18,330
Go get a room, already...

599
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:21,090
What do you think we are doing?

600
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,620
I don’t know what he sees in her.

601
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:33,150
He’s like the perfect guy.

602
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:34,720
Perfect guy?

603
00:37:36,770 --> 00:37:38,370
So...

604
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,880
I was saying something important.

605
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:44,960
Were you?

606
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,090
Yeah, about how we’re not so...

607
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:47,850
Exactly.

608
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:54,060
Hey, can you pass
me the bottle please?

609
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:54,960
Might as well.

610
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:09,000
Whoa. I’m proud of you, you
didn’t seem like the drinking type.

611
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:15,260
Why not? Stereotypes are dangerous.

612
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:25,110
Yeah, well... you just seem extremely
wholesome! Nice, simple, girl next door.

613
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,980
(in Bengali)

614
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,860
Huh... What?

615
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:32,100
What does that mean?

616
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:46,840
Yeah, you know you Bengali women are
just a bunch of cliquish, pseudo intellectuals.

617
00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:49,010
Are you kidding me?

618
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:49,760
No.

619
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:56,380
You Punjabi boys are just a
bunch of cheap, flashy brats!

620
00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:00,130
At least you’re easy on the eyes...

621
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:03,030
Is that a compliment?

622
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:05,510
No.

623
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:10,830
So, I was saying...

624
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:14,500
As you were saying...

625
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:15,270
Yeah.

626
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:21,250
Never mind.

627
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:27,860
Where are you going?

628
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:32,410
Ah... Got to get more booze silly.

629
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:35,880
Look at this woman...

630
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:39,000
You got to go to sleep silly!

631
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:39,620
No.

632
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:40,600
Let’s go! Get up.

633
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:42,780
Come on, Get up man!

634
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:46,260
You, evil boy. What are
you doing? Put me down.

635
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:49,010
- You are getting to bed.
- I’m fine, Figaro.

636
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:50,530
No, you are not. Sleep!

637
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:52,420
- I don’t want to sleep.
- Yes.

638
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:54,140
You are getting to bed, right now.

639
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:56,940
No, please...

640
00:39:57,090 --> 00:40:00,900
- Booze, Can I have more booze?
- No.

641
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:10,820
Night.

642
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:13,700
See you.

643
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:23,010
Hold on.

644
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:24,100
It’s stuck.

645
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,660
Come on.

646
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,590
Move, okay, move, let me do it.

647
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:30,470
Hey!

648
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:31,400
You’re late.

649
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:32,490
You’re grumpy.

650
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:33,890
Whatever.

651
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:35,670
Can I just dump this?

652
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:37,550
Good morning.

653
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:38,980
Hey...

654
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:40,720
Welcome, finally.

655
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:43,090
All aboard?

656
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,470
- Yes, let’s go.
- So hung over.

657
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:49,490
Shut up.

658
00:40:50,830 --> 00:40:52,600
(Music)

659
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:37,660
Speak no evil,

660
00:41:38,050 --> 00:41:42,720
Don’t speak evil,

661
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:50,660
Speak no evil,

662
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:08,500
Don’t speak evil,

663
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:26,390
No, speak no evil.

664
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:23,500
This whole whacked out
world is just too frustrating.

665
00:43:23,650 --> 00:43:25,620
A flashy postcard with the inscription:

666
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,840
This is my simple religion...

667
00:43:28,590 --> 00:43:32,510
There’s no need for temples,
no need for complicated philosophy...

668
00:43:32,590 --> 00:43:36,140
...the philosophy is kindness.

669
00:43:36,210 --> 00:43:38,060
So, it’s really that simple, is it?

670
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:47,130
Delhi, 1984. Bombay, 1992.
Gujarat, 2002. Assam, 2012.

671
00:43:47,890 --> 00:43:53,320
In the name of religion, countless
men, women and children butchered alive!

672
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:59,340
All in the name of religion?
Or in the game of politics?

673
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:03,940
...This whole whacked out
world is just too frustrating.

674
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:10,690
Thupten!

675
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:13,650
Jay! How are you?

676
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:14,470
Absolutely fine.

677
00:44:14,530 --> 00:44:15,740
I wasn’t sure when
you guys were coming.

678
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:18,440
- I know, we got here much earlier.
- Thupten!

679
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:19,420
- Hey, Niz...
- How are you?

680
00:44:19,450 --> 00:44:20,250
I’m good. How are you?

681
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:21,230
Very well.

682
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:24,560
Ah! This is Maggie.

683
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:26,690
- Hi.
- Hello.

684
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:30,900
And... Yeah, that is Figs.

685
00:44:30,930 --> 00:44:33,610
- Hey, how are you?
- Very good.

686
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:35,740
So, who’s hungry?

687
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:37,100
- Me.
- Me.

688
00:44:37,590 --> 00:44:38,930
Great!

689
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:45,090
So, Figs and Maggie,
how do you like 'Little Lhasa'?

690
00:44:45,410 --> 00:44:47,190
I love it. It’s gorgeous.

691
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:53,290
It’s a strange place.

692
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:54,980
How so?

693
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:58,520
I mean, yeah it’s gorgeous of course...

694
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:06,820
...but there’s this strange brew of politics and
religion. Things that I find completely unnecessary.

695
00:45:06,930 --> 00:45:11,500
It’s a beautiful place,
caught up in a pointless exercise.

696
00:45:13,690 --> 00:45:15,310
I mean, Tibet’s never going to be free ...

697
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:21,220
And praying isn’t going to solve
anything. It’s all pretty pointless really.

698
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:27,990
The cause is hopeless,
perhaps. But not the fight...

699
00:45:28,570 --> 00:45:32,060
I believe in fighting.
My faith has certainly helped me in that.

700
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:35,130
Well, I’m not so convinced...

701
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:39,680
Frankly religion hasn’t done
much other than divide and destroy...

702
00:45:41,810 --> 00:45:44,200
It’s an emotional crutch, man.

703
00:45:45,770 --> 00:45:46,670
Figs has a point there.

704
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:55,200
Ah! I do? I mean,
yeah I do... Of course.

705
00:45:56,320 --> 00:46:02,180
Movements need to be organic, they
need to matter. They need to be real.

706
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:10,650
That’s when things can change but very often that
reality gets sidelined by many forces, including religion...

707
00:46:12,890 --> 00:46:14,410
...I don’t know if I’m making any sense.

708
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:22,160
People believing in something is different
than people being told to believe in something...

709
00:46:22,510 --> 00:46:23,820
The source is love after all.

710
00:46:24,470 --> 00:46:33,420
I agree that you need to question religion
if it invalidates love. I think... I don’t know.

711
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:39,440
Just live and let live, man.
I mean, that’s my point!

712
00:46:40,630 --> 00:46:47,240
That’s a flawed point, Niz! Our generation
achieves nothing because we’re passive by nature...

713
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:50,750
And the funny part is, we have
a voice, we just don’t know it.

714
00:46:50,750 --> 00:46:50,770
And the funny part is, we have
a voice, we just don’t know it.
- There is nothing passive about...
- Okay!

715
00:46:50,770 --> 00:46:53,200
- There is nothing passive about...
- Okay!

716
00:46:53,270 --> 00:46:54,940
Let’s just change the topic.

717
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:06,280
Aren’t you sick of her
soapbox lectures? I know I am.

718
00:47:08,110 --> 00:47:11,820
In Buddhism, we have a saying,

719
00:47:12,810 --> 00:47:18,330
'A straw floats on the surface of water,
but a precious gem placed upon it sinks’.

720
00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:23,940
You know what? I don’t get it.

721
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:30,470
Okay I’ll see you guys
tomorrow. Good night!

722
00:47:37,950 --> 00:47:38,880
Hey, hey!

723
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:41,980
- Oh. Hey!
- What’s up?

724
00:47:42,490 --> 00:47:46,560
Phew. It was getting really
intense in there. Had to get out.

725
00:47:50,730 --> 00:47:52,580
So, you like freezing?

726
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:57,240
I like breathing in fresh
air while it’s still around.

727
00:48:04,970 --> 00:48:06,450
You know, you were
really drunk the other night?

728
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:08,170
You do remember
some of that, don’t you?

729
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:11,200
Was I? Which night?

730
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:13,000
Precisely.

731
00:48:17,590 --> 00:48:20,050
You’re very fond of Maggie.

732
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:22,590
Why do you say that?

733
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:24,950
It’s pretty obvious Figs.

734
00:48:26,030 --> 00:48:26,820
Yeah.

735
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:32,520
Yeah well, I am... I was.

736
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:37,170
But I’m not so sure anymore, though.

737
00:48:41,730 --> 00:48:43,160
We should go.

738
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:49,490
No we shouldn’t.
We should stay right here.

739
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:51,540
Prisoners of the night.

740
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:11,800
Good morning, sir.

741
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:14,020
Hey, slept well?

742
00:50:14,070 --> 00:50:15,330
Like a rock.

743
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:17,070
Chai?

744
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:19,430
Mmm... Perfect.

745
00:50:24,570 --> 00:50:25,700
Here...

746
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:26,710
Thanks.

747
00:50:28,410 --> 00:50:33,430
And, here you go!
Toast, butter and jam.

748
00:50:37,010 --> 00:50:39,440
Niz told me you guys
are going to Mababajagal?

749
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:41,900
Have you heard of it?

750
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:44,630
Some say it’s the oldest
democracy on earth.

751
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:45,970
Really?

752
00:50:46,750 --> 00:50:51,360
And they have the best hash too.

753
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:55,410
What are you reading?

754
00:50:56,060 --> 00:50:59,100
An article by Marie Sartre,
this French journalist.

755
00:50:59,210 --> 00:51:03,350
Oh my god! I love her. She’s fantastic.

756
00:51:03,390 --> 00:51:05,270
She really writes it
like it is, you know!

757
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:08,710
Yeah. Do you know that she’s been
in this area for quite some time now?

758
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:11,870
Here? I had no idea.

759
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:15,450
She has been writing extensively
on this Paradise Found project.

760
00:51:15,810 --> 00:51:16,650
What’s that?

761
00:51:17,090 --> 00:51:19,630
This international chain is
trying to build a luxury resort.

762
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:22,060
They are soon going
to cut down the forest.

763
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:23,680
What?

764
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:29,370
The villagers are protesting,
the protest is gaining momentum.

765
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:30,500
Is it?

766
00:51:31,230 --> 00:51:34,050
Of course the media and activists
from all over have been pouring in.

767
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:39,830
And... I’m sure they could
use all the help they can get.

768
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:41,980
Since you are going
to be in the area...

769
00:51:43,010 --> 00:51:44,610
...it might be worth stopping by.

770
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:49,130
Thupten, I’d love to!

771
00:51:50,650 --> 00:51:52,140
But it’ll depend on the others...

772
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:56,680
I’ll definitely try.

773
00:51:57,210 --> 00:51:58,970
(Music)

774
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:06,290
Looking back on life,

775
00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:10,020
I sometimes wonder why,

776
00:52:10,970 --> 00:52:14,080
It takes so long to find,

777
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:18,990
A way to make it right.

778
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:25,190
Free, free riding,

779
00:52:26,790 --> 00:52:28,660
It’s my life.

780
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:37,440
Free, free riding,

781
00:52:39,310 --> 00:52:41,850
Free…

782
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:45,770
(Music)

783
00:52:52,180 --> 00:52:52,760
Hello.

784
00:52:54,330 --> 00:52:56,980
Is this Mababajagal?

785
00:52:57,330 --> 00:52:58,730
Honey, It ain’t.

786
00:52:59,550 --> 00:53:01,970
Mababajagal’s on the
other side of the mountain.

787
00:53:03,010 --> 00:53:04,780
Thirty miles as the crow flies.

788
00:53:06,890 --> 00:53:08,390
Join us.

789
00:53:09,870 --> 00:53:10,710
Thank you.

790
00:53:16,310 --> 00:53:17,520
Where are you folks coming from?

791
00:53:17,690 --> 00:53:18,350
Dharamsala.

792
00:53:20,690 --> 00:53:26,720
Well I reckon you took a wrong turn
someplace. It’s funny how that happens!

793
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,790
I’m Vishnu Das by the way.
Pleased to make your acquaintance.

794
00:53:33,030 --> 00:53:35,560
And this, here, is my little lady.

795
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:37,200
Hello.

796
00:53:37,870 --> 00:53:39,830
You can call me Sunshine Daydream.

797
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:42,700
Jayashri Bose.

798
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:44,120
Niyaz.

799
00:53:45,850 --> 00:53:46,610
Hi.

800
00:53:47,230 --> 00:53:48,990
What’s your name, sweetheart?

801
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:49,910
Meghna.

802
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:53,740
Figs, I’m Figs.

803
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,150
Alright. So we’re all friends now.

804
00:53:57,310 --> 00:54:01,150
So Vishnu saheb, where are we exactly?

805
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:05,410
Oh. The Elysian fields...

806
00:54:06,510 --> 00:54:11,700
...the garden of Eden,
the abode of Aphrodite.

807
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:14,880
We just call it the commune.

808
00:54:18,730 --> 00:54:24,030
It’s just up around the corner, I don’t
know what it is but it keeps getting stronger.

809
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:30,880
Painted faces beneath the diamond sky,
dancing bodies on the emerald earth.

810
00:54:32,210 --> 00:54:33,970
Flowers in her hair and
madness in her eyes.

811
00:54:36,010 --> 00:54:37,780
It’s just up around the corner.

812
00:54:40,250 --> 00:54:45,190
I feel like an outlaw,
a fugitive on the run.

813
00:54:46,350 --> 00:54:48,670
I guess there is no turning back.

814
00:54:49,430 --> 00:54:51,640
Don’t knock it if
you haven’t tried it!

815
00:54:53,270 --> 00:54:57,840
Like books are food for the mind,
LSD is food for the soul.

816
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:01,570
Call me a dirty old
hippie, if you like...

817
00:55:01,810 --> 00:55:08,870
...but if we all smoked pot and tripped on acid
every now and then, the world would be a lot groovier...

818
00:55:09,530 --> 00:55:10,740
...I do believe it!

819
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:15,270
You and Figs would get along great!

820
00:55:15,580 --> 00:55:16,050
Yeah.

821
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:22,960
Hey!

822
00:55:23,970 --> 00:55:24,260
Hi!

823
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:31,120
Let’s go. Where’s Niz?

824
00:55:31,790 --> 00:55:33,760
- I left some stuff in the car.
- Ah!

825
00:55:36,370 --> 00:55:39,970
Niz is such an idiot.
I mean, we’re completely lost...

826
00:55:41,510 --> 00:55:42,280
What a mess.

827
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:44,550
Oh chill, man.
We’ll find the way. It’s okay.

828
00:55:51,270 --> 00:55:54,100
Is everything okay?

829
00:55:54,690 --> 00:55:57,400
Yeah. Thanks for your concern!

830
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:00,580
What do you mean?

831
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:07,260
Figs, just because you’ve found a
girlfriend, will you forget your friends?

832
00:56:10,310 --> 00:56:12,100
What do you mean, Maggie?

833
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:14,080
Huh?

834
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:15,470
Nothing. Forget it.

835
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:22,220
I first came to this country in 1968,
part of the infamous hippie exodus.

836
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,120
It’s sort of been home ever since...

837
00:56:28,230 --> 00:56:30,430
Got me a little shack around the corner.

838
00:56:31,650 --> 00:56:39,600
I give tours, lectures, write
books on meditation. Yeah...

839
00:56:40,580 --> 00:56:44,680
For a kid from Baton Rouge, Louisiana,
I’d say that’s doing all right!

840
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:49,840
Say, I’d love to have
you kids over sometime!

841
00:56:50,970 --> 00:56:55,690
You don’t need to buy nothing!
Well it wouldn’t hurt if you did...

842
00:56:55,930 --> 00:56:56,610
If we did what?

843
00:56:57,170 --> 00:57:00,250
Vishnu Das has invited us
to his charming establishment.

844
00:57:01,190 --> 00:57:01,690
Oh, what’s that?

845
00:57:02,070 --> 00:57:06,500
He runs a shack and he might have some
things that will interest us. What do you guys say?

846
00:57:06,610 --> 00:57:08,070
- Sounds good.
- Yeah sure.

847
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:09,440
Alright, let’s go!

848
00:57:17,950 --> 00:57:26,350
Hey Mr Vishnu! Do you happen to have
any decent accessories to go along with this one?

849
00:57:26,810 --> 00:57:28,460
That one’s a real beauty, ain’t she?

850
00:57:29,540 --> 00:57:34,410
I’ve got some hash if that’s what
you mean, kid. But it ain’t no cream!

851
00:57:35,790 --> 00:57:41,620
You know,them government folks are building
some glitzy resort between here and Mababajagal.

852
00:57:42,150 --> 00:57:47,380
And there’s been trouble with the
locals! We can’t get any decent hash.

853
00:57:49,490 --> 00:57:50,670
Is the trouble bad?

854
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:55,130
Well there ain’t no such
thing as good trouble!

855
00:57:56,480 --> 00:58:03,310
You know, my advice is if you all are planning on
heading there anyway, you all might as well wait.

856
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:07,580
Oh no! I can’t wait,
I’m sick of waiting, please.

857
00:58:08,070 --> 00:58:12,350
Well, patience is a virtue, sweetheart.

858
00:58:12,950 --> 00:58:16,090
And you strike me as the virtuous kind.

859
00:58:19,590 --> 00:58:22,660
Well, I’ll take this one.
For posterity then.

860
00:58:23,330 --> 00:58:24,640
You won’t regret it!

861
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:28,270
Sir. We’re running low on booze and...

862
00:58:28,620 --> 00:58:32,300
...I get that you don’t have any cream but is
there some other way you could sort us out?

863
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:38,680
Well, let’s see if I
can help you all out.

864
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:45,460
Could I interest you in some acid?

865
00:58:50,270 --> 00:58:54,890
Nothing floats your
boat quite like... LSD.

866
00:58:54,970 --> 00:58:58,720
Mr. Vishnu, trust me I know...

867
00:58:59,370 --> 00:59:01,410
Okay, we’ll take three stamps.

868
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:02,870
Three?

869
00:59:03,050 --> 00:59:04,090
Make that four.

870
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:07,380
Are you sure about this?

871
00:59:10,340 --> 00:59:12,360
Don’t knock it if you
haven’t tried it, right?

872
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:13,650
Right.

873
00:59:15,170 --> 00:59:16,400
Great.

874
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:46,630
Slowly, slowly stay my mind.
Slowly everything happens.

875
00:59:48,090 --> 00:59:54,210
The gardener may water a hundred times
but when the season comes... there is fruit.

876
00:59:55,750 --> 00:59:58,430
This banana is fantastic.

877
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:04,290
Did you just say that?

878
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:07,300
It’s magical.

879
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:26,870
I don’t think I’ve seen an
orange as orange as that...

880
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:30,230
This orange, actually, ever before.

881
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:32,820
You’re messing up my
picnic. Are you nuts?

882
01:00:35,130 --> 01:00:35,920
Look!

883
01:01:13,950 --> 01:01:16,000
This orange...

884
01:01:17,350 --> 01:01:18,470
Yes, madam?

885
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:26,740
It must die.

886
01:01:34,970 --> 01:01:36,730
It must die...

887
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:59,030
Listen!

888
01:04:45,590 --> 01:04:47,800
Sun king plays on my face.

889
01:04:48,490 --> 01:04:50,500
Crystal parliaments shatter easy.

890
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:54,430
Sun king plays on my face.

891
01:04:55,560 --> 01:04:56,920
Love is atomic sugar.

892
01:04:59,100 --> 01:05:00,840
Sun king plays on my face.

893
01:05:02,230 --> 01:05:03,560
Two strands merge.

894
01:05:50,180 --> 01:05:54,110
Guys, we should probably
hit the road soon...

895
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:56,450
Food is good.

896
01:05:57,100 --> 01:05:58,520
Food is good.

897
01:05:59,590 --> 01:06:00,330
I love food.

898
01:06:01,260 --> 01:06:02,390
I love food too.

899
01:06:04,090 --> 01:06:05,330
I just lost my appetite.

900
01:06:10,950 --> 01:06:12,130
Good morning, kids.

901
01:06:12,130 --> 01:06:12,140
Good morning, kids.
Good morning.

902
01:06:12,140 --> 01:06:13,010
Good morning.

903
01:06:16,290 --> 01:06:16,790
Coffee?

904
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:19,270
I don’t mind if I do.

905
01:06:24,450 --> 01:06:30,940
Ah! How was the acid trip?

906
01:06:32,820 --> 01:06:34,920
Full power.

907
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:37,810
Jay?

908
01:06:41,170 --> 01:06:42,850
Glad to be of service.

909
01:06:47,070 --> 01:06:48,340
Is everything okay?

910
01:06:48,340 --> 01:06:48,350
Is everything okay?
Yeah.

911
01:06:48,350 --> 01:06:49,530
Yeah.

912
01:06:57,400 --> 01:07:03,780
(in Italian)Quante volte? Non senti?

913
01:07:05,820 --> 01:07:08,410
Darling... Darling, make love.

914
01:07:08,420 --> 01:07:09,180
No darling!

915
01:07:09,570 --> 01:07:10,780
Make love not...

916
01:07:10,870 --> 01:07:12,380
(in Italian)Basta!

917
01:07:12,460 --> 01:07:16,090
(in Italian)

918
01:07:18,590 --> 01:07:21,020
I was going to say make love not war.

919
01:07:23,210 --> 01:07:25,640
She’s been mad as a wet
hen these last few days.

920
01:07:27,030 --> 01:07:31,130
It’s our annual Moon
Rave tonight. Lots to do...

921
01:07:31,230 --> 01:07:33,470
Moon rave? What’s that?

922
01:07:33,810 --> 01:07:36,440
Well, a bunch of kids get
together every other night.

923
01:07:37,930 --> 01:07:44,910
They do drugs and have sex and then
they do more drugs and have more sex.

924
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:46,080
That’s pretty much it.

925
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:47,230
Okay.

926
01:07:47,950 --> 01:07:50,640
Sounds like fun. We should go right?

927
01:07:52,130 --> 01:07:53,540
I don’t know man,
we should get going.

928
01:07:54,810 --> 01:07:57,000
Come on! We can
hit the road tomorrow.

929
01:07:58,290 --> 01:07:59,800
Do we always have to
do what you want?

930
01:08:02,420 --> 01:08:06,340
Niz! We’ve come this far,
we might as well go all the way.

931
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:09,220
Let’s just do what Jay wants.

932
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:22,460
This place was such a happy accident.

933
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:23,670
Yeah.

934
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:31,450
Maggie’s party seems like so
long ago. Doesn’t it, Figaro?

935
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:36,820
It seems like years ago. And you
were so friendly to me that night.

936
01:08:36,820 --> 01:08:37,290
Hey!

937
01:08:40,300 --> 01:08:41,950
But is it not love that
knows how to make...

938
01:08:42,050 --> 01:08:44,660
...smooth things rough and
rough things smooth?

939
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:48,140
That’s deep.

940
01:08:49,130 --> 01:08:52,030
It is. It’s not me,
it’s Vikram Seth.

941
01:08:54,350 --> 01:08:54,820
Ah.

942
01:08:56,400 --> 01:09:00,920
I was just thinking that things change.

943
01:09:01,010 --> 01:09:03,660
Yeah. But... I mean, come on,
wouldn’t life be boring if they didn’t?

944
01:09:04,990 --> 01:09:05,710
I guess.

945
01:09:07,730 --> 01:09:10,200
Sometimes things get more
complicated than they should be.

946
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:12,980
I mean, look at the four of us...

947
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:19,760
Yeah. Changes upon changes,
we are more or less the same.

948
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:20,660
Vikram Seth?

949
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:23,430
Close. Simon and Garfunkel.

950
01:09:25,180 --> 01:09:25,870
Idiot.

951
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:29,960
Let’s head back!
We have a long night ahead.

952
01:09:31,890 --> 01:09:32,840
Oh god! The rave.

953
01:09:54,620 --> 01:09:56,390
Give me two whiskeys, yeah?

954
01:10:00,990 --> 01:10:01,840
Insane.

955
01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:03,460
What?

956
01:10:05,750 --> 01:10:07,550
This is insane!

957
01:10:07,570 --> 01:10:09,830
What... What? It’s not your scene?

958
01:10:10,780 --> 01:10:13,210
Come on, look at
this place! It’s beautiful.

959
01:10:15,670 --> 01:10:21,020
I don’t know... I always
saw the world in shades...

960
01:10:21,020 --> 01:10:22,780
...of black and white.

961
01:10:23,580 --> 01:10:25,690
And now there is all this color!

962
01:10:29,530 --> 01:10:31,710
Yeah. It’s funny that
you say that because,

963
01:10:31,870 --> 01:10:35,080
I just feel like there’s
so much color...

964
01:10:36,180 --> 01:10:38,600
Now, I finally see a bit
of black and white.

965
01:10:56,660 --> 01:10:57,330
Hey!

966
01:10:57,340 --> 01:10:58,630
Vishnu Das is shooting up.

967
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:00,160
What?

968
01:11:00,660 --> 01:11:02,420
Vishnu Das is shooting up!

969
01:11:03,100 --> 01:11:04,140
Shooting up?

970
01:11:04,140 --> 01:11:07,200
Brown Sugar, baby. Heroin.

971
01:11:07,250 --> 01:11:08,640
Maggie, this is...

972
01:11:09,450 --> 01:11:11,050
Aren’t you a little bit curious?

973
01:11:11,260 --> 01:11:12,400
Maggie this is not...

974
01:11:13,250 --> 01:11:14,940
I want you to do this with me...

975
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:16,600
Maggie, listen!

976
01:11:16,700 --> 01:11:18,410
Under any other circumstances,

977
01:11:18,410 --> 01:11:21,230
maybe I would have but this but this...

978
01:11:21,310 --> 01:11:23,220
What? Speak up!
I can’t hear you.

979
01:11:23,220 --> 01:11:26,230
Maggie! It is not a
good idea, come on...

980
01:11:26,430 --> 01:11:28,750
What is wrong with you?

981
01:11:31,220 --> 01:11:32,450
Whatever.

982
01:11:51,490 --> 01:11:55,250
Welcome to the twilight zone.

983
01:12:01,770 --> 01:12:03,530
Nice place.

984
01:12:20,270 --> 01:12:22,190
Are you afraid, sweetheart?

985
01:12:26,810 --> 01:12:31,440
Fear is the mother of morality.

986
01:13:01,404 --> 01:13:03,164
It’s my first time.

987
01:13:04,643 --> 01:13:06,193
I’ll be gentle.

988
01:13:22,758 --> 01:13:25,185
What the... What’s
going on here, man?

989
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:26,880
Figs!

990
01:13:28,346 --> 01:13:30,276
Hey! Stay groovy, man.

991
01:13:30,276 --> 01:13:32,036
Vishnu Das! Grow the fuck up.

992
01:13:35,031 --> 01:13:36,161
Show me your hand...

993
01:13:36,161 --> 01:13:37,921
What is this?
This is dangerous, man!

994
01:13:39,031 --> 01:13:41,021
Who the hell do
you think you are?

995
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:44,171
Who me? I’m your friend, Figs.

996
01:13:44,492 --> 01:13:46,452
Well, I was chilling.

997
01:13:48,940 --> 01:13:50,700
Chilling... You call this chilling?

998
01:13:52,203 --> 01:13:54,223
Okay, Ms. Rebel-without-a-cause,
go... Go! Chill...

999
01:13:57,119 --> 01:13:57,981
Hypocrite.

1000
01:13:59,092 --> 01:14:00,172
What?

1001
01:14:00,250 --> 01:14:02,810
You heard me!
You’re a hypocrite.

1002
01:14:12,157 --> 01:14:13,237
Maggie, listen!

1003
01:14:13,237 --> 01:14:15,327
First of all, I care
for you, all right?

1004
01:14:15,327 --> 01:14:16,638
And second of all,
you shouldn’t be...

1005
01:14:16,658 --> 01:14:17,939
...messing with this shit, man.

1006
01:14:17,939 --> 01:14:17,951
...messing with this shit, man.
It’s dangerous stuff.
Maggie, you’re crazy or what?

1007
01:14:17,951 --> 01:14:20,299
It’s dangerous stuff.
Maggie, you’re crazy or what?

1008
01:14:20,311 --> 01:14:22,268
What’s up with you, Maggie?

1009
01:14:22,437 --> 01:14:23,087
Niz!

1010
01:14:53,100 --> 01:14:53,813
What was that?

1011
01:14:53,891 --> 01:14:54,501
Niz!

1012
01:14:56,700 --> 01:14:57,470
What the fuck was that?

1013
01:14:57,856 --> 01:14:59,046
Nothing man. Take it easy.

1014
01:14:59,838 --> 01:15:00,688
Who the fuck do
you think you are?

1015
01:15:00,714 --> 01:15:01,184
Calm down...

1016
01:15:01,196 --> 01:15:02,956
Whoa, easy man...
Fucking easy!

1017
01:15:03,482 --> 01:15:04,212
Niz!

1018
01:15:06,223 --> 01:15:09,523
Niz... Come on,
Niz! Stop it.

1019
01:15:09,577 --> 01:15:10,707
Niz! Niz!

1020
01:15:12,946 --> 01:15:14,066
Nothing happened,
okay, nothing...

1021
01:15:18,210 --> 01:15:20,500
You know, I tried really hard to
be what you wanted me to be.

1022
01:15:22,310 --> 01:15:23,790
And I did it because I loved you.

1023
01:15:27,886 --> 01:15:31,841
But I guess love is just
a four letter word.

1024
01:15:37,079 --> 01:15:40,699
Fine! You’re not even worth it.

1025
01:16:19,912 --> 01:16:21,672
Oh Man...

1026
01:16:38,807 --> 01:16:41,337
Man, where is everyone?

1027
01:16:52,804 --> 01:16:54,904
Excuse me. Where did they go?

1028
01:16:55,004 --> 01:16:55,724
Who?

1029
01:16:56,082 --> 01:16:57,003
The others I was staying with.

1030
01:16:57,003 --> 01:16:57,012
The others I was staying with.
I don’t know what
you are talking about.

1031
01:16:57,012 --> 01:16:58,003
I don’t know what
you are talking about.

1032
01:16:58,003 --> 01:16:58,853
Did they leave a message?

1033
01:16:58,853 --> 01:16:59,893
I have no idea.

1034
01:17:00,453 --> 01:17:01,733
Hello stranger!

1035
01:17:02,307 --> 01:17:05,457
Hey, Maggie!
Where were you?

1036
01:17:06,350 --> 01:17:08,169
I was going to wake you but...

1037
01:17:08,169 --> 01:17:08,173
I was going to wake you but...
...then I decided against it.

1038
01:17:08,173 --> 01:17:09,929
...then I decided against it.

1039
01:17:10,343 --> 01:17:13,351
Ouch, you poor thing.

1040
01:17:14,418 --> 01:17:15,628
Anyway, come, let’s go...

1041
01:17:15,668 --> 01:17:16,348
Where to?

1042
01:17:17,325 --> 01:17:19,085
Come, get your bags.
Let’s get out of here!

1043
01:17:20,958 --> 01:17:21,478
What?

1044
01:17:23,539 --> 01:17:24,079
Say something...

1045
01:17:25,263 --> 01:17:27,183
Where’s Jay? Where’s Niz?

1046
01:17:27,183 --> 01:17:28,113
What’s going on, man?

1047
01:17:29,826 --> 01:17:30,326
I don’t know...

1048
01:17:31,431 --> 01:17:32,141
I think they left.

1049
01:17:51,663 --> 01:17:53,433
It’s not the end of the world.

1050
01:17:56,423 --> 01:17:57,793
Where are you going?

1051
01:17:58,509 --> 01:17:59,669
I don’t know.

1052
01:17:59,755 --> 01:18:02,889
We could go anywhere,
someplace far away...

1053
01:18:06,868 --> 01:18:08,715
You just let them leave?

1054
01:18:11,534 --> 01:18:13,244
I didn’t let them do anything, okay?

1055
01:18:13,296 --> 01:18:14,186
They just did.

1056
01:18:15,580 --> 01:18:16,720
And who cares anyway?

1057
01:18:21,158 --> 01:18:22,408
Maggie, what’s up with you?

1058
01:18:23,518 --> 01:18:24,488
What’s up with me?

1059
01:18:25,053 --> 01:18:26,543
So this is all my fault now?

1060
01:18:28,178 --> 01:18:28,668
Typical.

1061
01:18:29,368 --> 01:18:31,048
You know you created
such a mess last night.

1062
01:18:31,578 --> 01:18:32,988
And I was only trying
to help you, man...

1063
01:18:35,576 --> 01:18:37,646
You try so hard to stand out,

1064
01:18:39,189 --> 01:18:40,849
and because of that
at the end of the day,

1065
01:18:40,849 --> 01:18:42,609
you are just another conformist.

1066
01:18:44,333 --> 01:18:45,023
Am I?

1067
01:18:46,263 --> 01:18:47,963
So what does that make you then?

1068
01:18:51,690 --> 01:18:52,650
Bye Maggie.

1069
01:18:55,314 --> 01:18:56,724
Figs, come on!

1070
01:18:56,960 --> 01:18:58,500
It’s you and me yo’...

1071
01:19:06,659 --> 01:19:07,379
So what?

1072
01:19:08,619 --> 01:19:09,579
That’s it then?

1073
01:19:13,177 --> 01:19:13,947
Yeah.

1074
01:19:17,732 --> 01:19:18,912
Look, Figs!

1075
01:19:20,146 --> 01:19:21,876
I know I fucked up,

1076
01:19:22,665 --> 01:19:25,265
and everything was a big mess...

1077
01:19:28,178 --> 01:19:29,638
...but you’re my friend,

1078
01:19:31,349 --> 01:19:32,819
you’re supposed to be there for me.

1079
01:19:37,678 --> 01:19:38,388
Maggie look,

1080
01:19:40,131 --> 01:19:41,331
you know I’m always
there for you,

1081
01:19:42,317 --> 01:19:42,897
but...

1082
01:19:44,436 --> 01:19:47,646
...just this time I think you are going to
have to figure this out on your own.

1083
01:19:49,426 --> 01:19:50,166
I’m sorry.

1084
01:20:38,129 --> 01:20:40,119
Sir. It’s time to check out!

1085
01:20:40,139 --> 01:20:41,539
You need to leave the room.

1086
01:20:44,218 --> 01:20:45,779
What are you saying?

1087
01:20:45,779 --> 01:20:45,788
What are you saying?
I’ll leave in half an hour.

1088
01:20:45,788 --> 01:20:47,007
I’ll leave in half an hour.

1089
01:20:47,022 --> 01:20:48,034
No, right now!

1090
01:20:49,650 --> 01:20:50,270
Okay.

1091
01:21:36,564 --> 01:21:37,774
Tea?

1092
01:21:37,944 --> 01:21:38,824
Yeah.

1093
01:21:42,181 --> 01:21:43,211
Nice eye.

1094
01:21:47,174 --> 01:21:48,074
Thanks.

1095
01:21:49,576 --> 01:21:50,806
Maggie left.

1096
01:21:52,523 --> 01:21:53,593
So did Niz.

1097
01:21:54,413 --> 01:21:55,283
Oh.

1098
01:21:57,034 --> 01:21:59,301
He told me to tell you he is
sorry for knocking you senseless.

1099
01:21:59,330 --> 01:22:00,074
Yeah.

1100
01:22:02,730 --> 01:22:03,830
No hard feelings.

1101
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:07,460
Anyway.

1102
01:22:10,730 --> 01:22:13,767
Figs, I know what happened
last night wasn’t your fault.

1103
01:22:13,838 --> 01:22:15,028
Oh, really?

1104
01:22:16,877 --> 01:22:19,787
We’re okay, just so you know.

1105
01:22:21,831 --> 01:22:22,891
Are you sure about that?

1106
01:22:26,983 --> 01:22:28,293
I think so.

1107
01:22:29,458 --> 01:22:33,078
Yeah. It just feels like some
kind of weird nightmare.

1108
01:22:35,220 --> 01:22:36,990
As the old adage goes...

1109
01:22:38,033 --> 01:22:39,473
...‘shit happens’.

1110
01:22:45,955 --> 01:22:48,285
Look, I’m not promising anything.

1111
01:22:50,419 --> 01:22:51,539
You don’t have to.

1112
01:22:52,920 --> 01:22:54,110
I screwed up.

1113
01:23:03,103 --> 01:23:05,993
I thought you would
have left with Niz.

1114
01:23:06,101 --> 01:23:07,731
I almost did...

1115
01:23:11,903 --> 01:23:13,663
...but here we are.

1116
01:23:15,170 --> 01:23:16,195
Indeed.

1117
01:23:22,207 --> 01:23:24,347
I... I don’t really know
how to say this,

1118
01:23:24,347 --> 01:23:26,567
I’m not good at expressing myself.

1119
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:30,790
But I stayed,

1120
01:23:31,650 --> 01:23:32,550
because...

1121
01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:40,040
Because I wanted to.

1122
01:24:05,848 --> 01:24:07,448
I’m catching a bus in a bit.

1123
01:24:07,478 --> 01:24:09,198
A bus? Where are you going?

1124
01:24:10,866 --> 01:24:12,556
You heard about that
resort they are building?

1125
01:24:14,975 --> 01:24:17,555
An entire village is going
to be completely destroyed,

1126
01:24:17,990 --> 01:24:19,630
unless someone does something about it.

1127
01:24:21,105 --> 01:24:23,665
The government’s been
paid off, surprise, surprise!

1128
01:24:24,562 --> 01:24:26,852
Don’t tell me you want to go
and save the world after this?

1129
01:24:31,080 --> 01:24:31,890
Anyhow...

1130
01:24:32,911 --> 01:24:35,221
Thupten says they need
all the help that they can get.

1131
01:24:35,940 --> 01:24:38,170
Marie Sartre is there;
she is covering the protest and...

1132
01:24:38,445 --> 01:24:41,005
Since our road trip has come
to this untimely end.

1133
01:24:44,604 --> 01:24:45,524
We should go.

1134
01:24:45,990 --> 01:24:48,110
We should help in
whatever way we can.

1135
01:24:50,895 --> 01:24:52,055
Sounds boring.

1136
01:24:55,368 --> 01:24:58,118
But after all we’ve been through,

1137
01:24:59,416 --> 01:25:01,146
I think boring is
exactly what I need.

1138
01:25:03,812 --> 01:25:05,042
Let’s go!

1139
01:25:28,971 --> 01:25:31,831
We are burning embers in a
world of deepening shadow...

1140
01:25:33,482 --> 01:25:35,612
...and the road we tread on has no end.

1141
01:25:38,276 --> 01:25:40,046
But there is still the sky,

1142
01:25:41,021 --> 01:25:44,391
the windy mountain and
the river below it.

1143
01:25:47,894 --> 01:25:48,884
So let’s tread on,

1144
01:25:50,427 --> 01:25:53,037
let’s climb to the highest
peaks of our dying kingdom.

1145
01:25:53,842 --> 01:25:55,182
For there is still the sky,

1146
01:25:55,978 --> 01:25:57,408
the windy mountain,

1147
01:25:57,910 --> 01:25:59,460
and the river below it.

1148
01:26:13,777 --> 01:26:15,347
There’s nobody here.

1149
01:26:21,529 --> 01:26:24,442
Okay, who is this journalist
we are looking for, again?

1150
01:26:24,618 --> 01:26:26,058
Hmm... Marie Sartre.

1151
01:26:29,162 --> 01:26:31,062
Any relation of Jean Paul?

1152
01:26:32,185 --> 01:26:32,795
Ha ha.

1153
01:26:37,649 --> 01:26:41,177
Excuse me! Hello.

1154
01:26:41,192 --> 01:26:42,072
Hello.

1155
01:26:44,222 --> 01:26:47,812
I don’t see anybody around,
where did the villagers go?

1156
01:26:48,419 --> 01:26:49,509
Go that way...

1157
01:26:49,850 --> 01:26:51,250
That way?

1158
01:26:52,030 --> 01:26:53,370
Thank you.

1159
01:27:57,117 --> 01:28:00,537
Mr. Hariharan! We’ve tied
around 800 Rakhis so far.

1160
01:28:02,072 --> 01:28:03,992
Really! Good job.

1161
01:28:05,519 --> 01:28:06,319
We are almost done.

1162
01:28:06,387 --> 01:28:06,907
Yes.

1163
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:09,390
These two have come from Delhi.

1164
01:28:09,875 --> 01:28:11,015
Perhaps from the media.

1165
01:28:11,115 --> 01:28:11,975
What do you want?

1166
01:28:12,110 --> 01:28:15,293
Nothing! We’re here to help you.

1167
01:28:15,326 --> 01:28:16,636
We’re not from the media.

1168
01:28:17,558 --> 01:28:18,768
Marie Sartre?

1169
01:28:19,641 --> 01:28:20,911
That’s me! Hi.

1170
01:28:21,787 --> 01:28:24,137
Hi, my name is Jayshri Bose.

1171
01:28:24,410 --> 01:28:25,610
That’s Figs.

1172
01:28:26,261 --> 01:28:27,901
We heard through a
friend that you were...

1173
01:28:27,901 --> 01:28:29,591
...in the area and about
what’s going on here.

1174
01:28:30,019 --> 01:28:32,209
And we thought we
could, well, volunteer?

1175
01:28:34,674 --> 01:28:36,354
Excellent. Welcome on board.

1176
01:28:36,649 --> 01:28:37,669
Thank you.

1177
01:28:38,198 --> 01:28:40,675
This is my dear friend Ram Hariharan.

1178
01:28:40,684 --> 01:28:41,274
Hello.

1179
01:28:41,277 --> 01:28:43,327
He’s chief coordinator
of the Resistance;

1180
01:28:44,163 --> 01:28:45,553
that’s what we call ourselves.

1181
01:28:46,535 --> 01:28:50,619
Why don’t you brief them.
I have to file a petition.

1182
01:28:55,036 --> 01:28:57,056
It’s a throwback to the Chipko movement.

1183
01:28:58,432 --> 01:29:01,442
These Rakhis are symbolic of
both protest and protection.

1184
01:29:06,309 --> 01:29:11,320
So what exactly is going to happen
if this resort does get built?

1185
01:29:11,692 --> 01:29:14,382
Well a lot of things...

1186
01:29:15,675 --> 01:29:17,445
In a nutshell,
this resort will signal...

1187
01:29:17,445 --> 01:29:21,257
...the death of the people of these
hills and of the forest they love.

1188
01:29:24,326 --> 01:29:27,126
We’ve had some recent
success in stalling the project...

1189
01:29:27,136 --> 01:29:28,526
...but unfortunately...

1190
01:29:28,526 --> 01:29:30,277
...we just found out that...

1191
01:29:30,304 --> 01:29:33,789
...the Environment Ministry has
given the go ahead for the resort.

1192
01:29:34,514 --> 01:29:36,774
They are expected to start
pulling down trees...

1193
01:29:36,774 --> 01:29:37,924
...and seizing land...

1194
01:29:38,611 --> 01:29:39,771
...any day now.

1195
01:29:39,890 --> 01:29:41,000
That’s terrible.

1196
01:29:41,986 --> 01:29:42,896
But, I mean...

1197
01:29:43,684 --> 01:29:45,934
...how can they give a go ahead
like this? That’s so strange.

1198
01:29:46,696 --> 01:29:48,986
Political pressure, vested interests.

1199
01:29:49,842 --> 01:29:51,502
Most importantly, moolah!

1200
01:29:51,925 --> 01:29:54,725
Everyone can be bought
if the price is right, eh?

1201
01:29:59,327 --> 01:30:03,617
Don’t mind my asking but
aren’t you a journalist?

1202
01:30:04,411 --> 01:30:05,531
Yes.

1203
01:30:07,121 --> 01:30:11,551
So shouldn’t it be part of your
job to be non-partisan...

1204
01:30:11,590 --> 01:30:14,311
...or unbiased or whatever
it is you guys call it?

1205
01:30:15,681 --> 01:30:17,951
Well, I’ll leave this
to the Indian media...

1206
01:30:18,007 --> 01:30:20,757
...since they seem to be
doing such a great job.

1207
01:30:21,800 --> 01:30:22,861
Good one.

1208
01:30:24,788 --> 01:30:27,064
There is a difference, you know,

1209
01:30:27,141 --> 01:30:29,952
between being biased and
being true to yourself.

1210
01:30:31,782 --> 01:30:35,187
There is a difference
between hyping a cause...

1211
01:30:35,838 --> 01:30:38,868
...and passionately advocating
a cause you believe in.

1212
01:30:46,453 --> 01:30:47,873
Radha...

1213
01:30:47,873 --> 01:30:49,213
Here! This is for you...

1214
01:30:55,822 --> 01:30:56,792
That’s enough.

1215
01:30:56,792 --> 01:30:59,052
Eat! Tomorrow’s a big day.

1216
01:31:10,684 --> 01:31:11,624
Roti, anyone?

1217
01:31:13,084 --> 01:31:13,834
Yes, please.

1218
01:31:19,154 --> 01:31:19,884
Marie.

1219
01:31:22,689 --> 01:31:24,449
I’ve been meaning to tell you this...

1220
01:31:26,272 --> 01:31:27,602
Don’t really know how but...

1221
01:31:28,215 --> 01:31:30,165
I really admire your writing.

1222
01:31:31,263 --> 01:31:33,463
What you say, your words,

1223
01:31:34,749 --> 01:31:35,859
they’re honest.

1224
01:31:36,786 --> 01:31:39,376
And that’s just so rare.

1225
01:31:41,542 --> 01:31:43,192
It’s amazing to finally meet you!

1226
01:31:44,185 --> 01:31:44,975
Thanks.

1227
01:31:45,649 --> 01:31:47,659
I’m glad to meet both of you too.

1228
01:31:48,510 --> 01:31:50,230
It’s good to know we are not alone.

1229
01:31:53,043 --> 01:31:54,983
So how long have you been here?

1230
01:31:56,304 --> 01:31:57,844
For some months now.

1231
01:31:59,315 --> 01:32:01,075
It sounds crazy, je sais!

1232
01:32:06,819 --> 01:32:09,875
It’s obvious that things are
not how they should be.

1233
01:32:11,126 --> 01:32:15,456
The value of our methods and
means of protest is less obvious.

1234
01:32:16,976 --> 01:32:17,966
Time will tell.

1235
01:32:18,691 --> 01:32:21,951
We are nothing but a moment’s
sunlight fading in the grass.

1236
01:32:23,222 --> 01:32:25,922
(in French)Il faut qu'une porte soit ouverte ou fermée.

1237
01:32:28,201 --> 01:32:30,671
I have no idea what that
means but it sounds beautiful!

1238
01:32:33,499 --> 01:32:34,459
Marie...

1239
01:32:34,863 --> 01:32:36,723
...what made you
fight for this cause?

1240
01:32:36,899 --> 01:32:38,099
What cause?

1241
01:32:38,364 --> 01:32:41,914
I believe in saving these
people and their forest.

1242
01:32:42,563 --> 01:32:43,953
What about the bigger picture?

1243
01:32:44,085 --> 01:32:46,465
What about corruption in India in general?

1244
01:32:47,315 --> 01:32:49,005
Do you think we can fight that?

1245
01:32:50,261 --> 01:32:50,901
I do...

1246
01:32:51,930 --> 01:32:54,100
...but with a pinch of salt,
you might say.

1247
01:32:54,824 --> 01:32:55,704
What do you mean?

1248
01:32:56,559 --> 01:32:58,649
I believe in the potential of the cause.

1249
01:32:59,510 --> 01:33:02,500
We stand witness to the
birth of a real revolution.

1250
01:33:03,203 --> 01:33:04,403
I believe in that.

1251
01:33:06,376 --> 01:33:08,667
So, what brought you two here?

1252
01:33:08,667 --> 01:33:11,711
To this picturesque battlefield.

1253
01:33:13,340 --> 01:33:14,370
Is everything ready?

1254
01:33:14,470 --> 01:33:16,020
Yes, it’s all ready.

1255
01:33:17,953 --> 01:33:19,803
We are filing another petition.

1256
01:33:20,216 --> 01:33:21,986
It won’t make a difference,

1257
01:33:23,024 --> 01:33:24,716
in any case we will
demonstrate tomorrow!

1258
01:33:24,997 --> 01:33:26,897
Can we help in any way?

1259
01:33:27,249 --> 01:33:28,809
We also want to do something!

1260
01:33:28,997 --> 01:33:29,717
Yes.

1261
01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:31,960
We will need all the
help we can get.

1262
01:33:34,164 --> 01:33:35,124
Alright then...

1263
01:33:36,239 --> 01:33:37,599
...let’s all gather in the morning.

1264
01:33:40,647 --> 01:33:43,857
Are there going to be a lot of people
at this demonstration tomorrow?

1265
01:33:44,553 --> 01:33:47,793
Villagers and activists, lawyers
and other professionals,

1266
01:33:48,371 --> 01:33:51,901
farmers and truck drivers, teachers
and students like yourselves.

1267
01:33:53,022 --> 01:33:55,082
The revolutionaries of modern India.

1268
01:33:58,091 --> 01:33:59,851
Do you think it’s going
to make a difference?

1269
01:33:59,949 --> 01:34:01,119
Who knows?

1270
01:34:01,593 --> 01:34:03,073
The fact of the matter is that we are...

1271
01:34:03,073 --> 01:34:04,303
...taking a stand...

1272
01:34:04,954 --> 01:34:05,944
...and that’s important.

1273
01:34:06,696 --> 01:34:08,706
It’s one thing to call
yourself a revolutionary...

1274
01:34:08,706 --> 01:34:10,996
...and quite another
thing to live like one.

1275
01:34:13,684 --> 01:34:14,774
People have enough
things in the world...

1276
01:34:14,774 --> 01:34:16,994
...to be really pissed about
right now, I know that.

1277
01:34:19,473 --> 01:34:23,593
But... I just wonder what
this struggle is doing...

1278
01:34:23,651 --> 01:34:25,581
...for the people of this village.

1279
01:34:26,771 --> 01:34:28,451
And that’s scary.

1280
01:34:31,408 --> 01:34:34,788
Well this movement makes
sense to me in the now.

1281
01:34:36,388 --> 01:34:37,738
That’s why I support it.

1282
01:34:38,618 --> 01:34:39,848
Fair enough for you, I suppose.

1283
01:34:40,738 --> 01:34:41,538
Still hungry?

1284
01:34:41,648 --> 01:34:42,428
Thanks.

1285
01:34:42,501 --> 01:34:43,021
No.

1286
01:34:43,228 --> 01:34:48,954
But I could really use a
drink right about now!

1287
01:34:49,445 --> 01:34:50,235
Dude.

1288
01:34:55,315 --> 01:34:56,205
That should do...

1289
01:34:56,256 --> 01:34:57,826
Oh, yes, thank you!

1290
01:35:08,718 --> 01:35:11,870
If I've a babe in town, Babe,

1291
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:15,625
It's just when you're around, Babe,

1292
01:35:15,625 --> 01:35:15,640
It's just when you're around, Babe,
If I've a babe in town, Babe,

1293
01:35:15,640 --> 01:35:17,995
If I've a babe in town, Babe,

1294
01:35:18,031 --> 01:35:20,915
It's just when you're around, Babe.

1295
01:35:21,215 --> 01:35:23,680
I caught a long slow freight, Babe,

1296
01:35:23,680 --> 01:35:23,705
I caught a long slow freight, Babe,
Bound out for Texas state, Babe,

1297
01:35:23,705 --> 01:35:26,996
Bound out for Texas state, Babe,

1298
01:35:27,020 --> 01:35:30,692
I caught a long slow freight, Babe,

1299
01:35:30,715 --> 01:35:33,933
Bound out for Texas state, Babe.

1300
01:35:44,711 --> 01:35:47,412
Marie?

1301
01:35:55,039 --> 01:35:57,182
Oh.

1302
01:35:58,922 --> 01:36:01,182
Three days I hung around, Babe,

1303
01:36:01,182 --> 01:36:04,894
That lonesome Texas town, Babe,

1304
01:36:04,974 --> 01:36:06,354
Let’s dance?

1305
01:36:06,923 --> 01:36:08,263
No, I can’t.

1306
01:36:08,448 --> 01:36:11,148
Said you was sick and low, Babe,

1307
01:36:11,263 --> 01:36:15,413
Said you was dyin' slow, Babe,

1308
01:36:15,473 --> 01:36:20,658
Said you was sick and low, Babe,

1309
01:36:21,904 --> 01:36:22,864
Oh...

1310
01:36:48,630 --> 01:36:51,430
I took my car yet , Babe,

1311
01:36:51,430 --> 01:36:51,434
I took my car yet , Babe,
So as to return to you, Babe,

1312
01:36:51,434 --> 01:36:53,700
So as to return to you, Babe,

1313
01:36:53,969 --> 01:36:57,029
I took my car yet , Babe,

1314
01:36:57,155 --> 01:37:00,055
So as to return to you, Babe,

1315
01:37:00,213 --> 01:37:02,753
When I got off that train, Babe,

1316
01:37:03,267 --> 01:37:06,316
You couldn't call my name, Babe,

1317
01:37:06,400 --> 01:37:09,070
When I got off that train, Babe,

1318
01:37:09,189 --> 01:37:12,469
You couldn't call my name, Babe.

1319
01:37:35,013 --> 01:37:38,863
This forest has given me life...

1320
01:37:40,633 --> 01:37:44,853
...and I shall stand by it till I die.

1321
01:37:47,081 --> 01:37:48,501
My brothers and sisters,

1322
01:37:48,752 --> 01:37:52,162
they call this project Paradise Found.

1323
01:37:52,671 --> 01:37:55,761
But I call it Paradise Lost!

1324
01:37:56,192 --> 01:37:57,732
Our forests will be cut,

1325
01:37:57,983 --> 01:38:01,973
our lands stolen, our homes broken!

1326
01:38:02,931 --> 01:38:08,837
A state that attacks her own people is
a state doomed to self-annihilation!

1327
01:38:10,501 --> 01:38:11,251
My brothers and sisters!

1328
01:38:12,661 --> 01:38:15,571
They say this resort is a
symbol of development.

1329
01:38:16,756 --> 01:38:18,006
At what cost?

1330
01:38:18,610 --> 01:38:22,563
The death of our forest?

1331
01:38:22,717 --> 01:38:24,967
The death of our villages?

1332
01:38:25,828 --> 01:38:27,718
At what cost?

1333
01:38:28,675 --> 01:38:31,266
This resort is not a
symbol of development,

1334
01:38:31,559 --> 01:38:34,769
it is a symbol of corruption!

1335
01:38:36,644 --> 01:38:39,754
My brothers and sisters, rise!

1336
01:38:39,754 --> 01:38:45,113
Embrace our trees!
Save them from death...

1337
01:38:45,280 --> 01:38:49,189
It is the wealth of our hills.

1338
01:38:50,978 --> 01:38:55,188
We won’t let them build this resort!

1339
01:38:55,188 --> 01:38:55,198
We won’t let them build this resort!
Ma’am, what is the
civil society doing about this?

1340
01:38:55,198 --> 01:38:57,739
Ma’am, what is the
civil society doing about this?

1341
01:38:57,813 --> 01:39:03,015
We won’t let them build this resort!

1342
01:39:03,065 --> 01:39:05,446
Are you willing to go to jail for this?

1343
01:39:05,446 --> 01:39:06,666
No comments.

1344
01:39:12,129 --> 01:39:13,299
Thank you.

1345
01:39:16,195 --> 01:39:20,665
Friends. Today is a dark day.

1346
01:39:22,023 --> 01:39:27,433
The illegitimate government of
India has declared war upon us!

1347
01:39:29,084 --> 01:39:32,744
This luxury resort is the
bastard child of greedy politicians,

1348
01:39:33,152 --> 01:39:34,832
and urban decadence.

1349
01:39:35,468 --> 01:39:39,008
It is a modern day mockery
of our age old values!

1350
01:39:39,602 --> 01:39:42,112
An insult to our Gandhian ways.

1351
01:39:42,838 --> 01:39:46,208
The people of these
hills, they are victims.

1352
01:39:47,115 --> 01:39:50,835
They are victims of a
malaise which afflicts us all.

1353
01:39:52,478 --> 01:39:54,588
That malaise is corruption.

1354
01:39:55,549 --> 01:39:59,049
They are the ones to be
sacrificed at the altar of avarice.

1355
01:39:59,516 --> 01:40:02,636
Mark my words,
we shall have revenge.

1356
01:40:03,569 --> 01:40:07,829
Let the ruling classes tremble
at the prospect of revolution.

1357
01:40:08,814 --> 01:40:12,154
India against corruption!

1358
01:41:47,038 --> 01:41:49,508
What does it mean to be
a revolutionary?

1359
01:41:50,130 --> 01:41:52,190
The war rages on...

1360
01:41:53,623 --> 01:41:56,603
We were knocked down by the
crushing force of a terrible defeat.

1361
01:41:57,726 --> 01:42:00,466
The futility of our actions
was only too obvious.

1362
01:42:02,346 --> 01:42:04,886
The extent of our
insignificance proved absolute.

1363
01:42:07,725 --> 01:42:09,435
If only I had stayed on...

1364
01:42:11,103 --> 01:42:14,163
But what could we do? It was over.

1365
01:42:16,819 --> 01:42:18,849
What does it mean to be a revolutionary?

1366
01:42:20,116 --> 01:42:22,106
The war rages on...

1367
01:42:26,293 --> 01:42:28,633
I was wrong when I thought I was free...

1368
01:42:30,421 --> 01:42:33,011
...we are all enslaved in
chains of our own making.

1369
01:42:35,028 --> 01:42:37,178
What does it mean to be a revolutionary?

1370
01:42:38,626 --> 01:42:40,196
The war rages on...

1371
01:43:03,442 --> 01:43:04,862
We’ve come a long way...

1372
01:43:06,189 --> 01:43:07,739
...but there’s no destination in sight.

1373
01:43:11,287 --> 01:43:12,807
Faith is the bird...

1374
01:43:13,823 --> 01:43:16,353
...that feels the light
when the dawn is still dark.

1375
01:43:18,681 --> 01:43:19,891
That’s deep.

1376
01:43:21,225 --> 01:43:22,155
Thanks...

1377
01:43:23,711 --> 01:43:24,801
It’s not me, it’s...

1378
01:43:25,864 --> 01:43:27,794
...Rabindranath Tagore.

1379
01:43:30,966 --> 01:43:32,596
But it’s frustrating,
you know, all the same.

1380
01:43:36,065 --> 01:43:36,655
What is?

1381
01:43:38,458 --> 01:43:40,078
It’s been sixty years since independence,

1382
01:43:41,532 --> 01:43:44,582
and we’re still fighting for the same thing,

1383
01:43:45,125 --> 01:43:46,925
for our freedom.

1384
01:43:51,785 --> 01:43:53,155
Someone once said...

1385
01:43:53,665 --> 01:43:57,805
‘When the power of love
overcomes the love of power,

1386
01:43:59,379 --> 01:44:01,259
that’s when the world will know peace’.

1387
01:44:02,701 --> 01:44:04,961
Who said that? Rabindranath Tagore, only?

1388
01:44:07,272 --> 01:44:08,252
Close.

1389
01:44:09,202 --> 01:44:10,522
Jimi Hendrix.

1390
01:44:26,667 --> 01:44:27,927
We lost it, eh?

1391
01:44:29,562 --> 01:44:31,062
Yeah. I guess so...

1392
01:44:35,042 --> 01:44:37,142
What is... It?

1393
01:44:42,691 --> 01:44:44,571
You know, we’ve lost
this battle I suppose.

1394
01:44:45,548 --> 01:44:47,168
But you know as well as I do Jay,

1395
01:44:49,614 --> 01:44:51,275
that there’s a
thousand people fighting...

1396
01:44:51,323 --> 01:44:53,731
...a thousand battles
every single day...

1397
01:44:53,731 --> 01:44:53,749
...a thousand battles
every single day...
...in this crazy country of ours.

1398
01:44:53,749 --> 01:44:55,644
...in this crazy country of ours.

1399
01:44:59,378 --> 01:45:02,218
I wonder where those two are...
Niz and Maggie.

1400
01:45:08,199 --> 01:45:09,969
I don’t know...

1401
01:45:13,022 --> 01:45:14,772
...but I’m glad you are with me.

1402
01:47:16,484 --> 01:47:17,724
What happened?

1403
01:47:19,159 --> 01:47:20,229
Where the hell are we?

1404
01:47:26,529 --> 01:47:27,379
Do you have any water?

1405
01:48:04,107 --> 01:48:05,907
Did you see that?

1406
01:48:06,754 --> 01:48:08,154
No, did you?

1407
01:48:57,671 --> 01:49:00,821
I am a poor wayfaring stranger,

1408
01:49:07,339 --> 01:49:12,309
Wandering through this world of woe,

1409
01:49:17,151 --> 01:49:20,681
And there's no sickness, no toil or danger,

1410
01:49:26,579 --> 01:49:30,189
In that bright land to which I go.

1411
01:49:36,819 --> 01:49:40,199
I'm going there to see my sister,

1412
01:49:41,581 --> 01:49:44,981
I’m going there no more to roam.

1413
01:49:46,755 --> 01:49:50,034
I'm only going over Firdaus,

1414
01:49:50,712 --> 01:49:54,340
I'm only going over home.

1415
01:50:20,983 --> 01:50:23,813
It’s been quite the journey, Figaro.

1416
01:50:25,922 --> 01:50:27,442
It certainly has, Miss Bose.

1417
01:50:30,094 --> 01:50:31,884
How do you know it’s over?

1418
01:50:33,318 --> 01:50:34,798
I never said it was.

1419
01:50:39,654 --> 01:50:41,024
Here we are...

1420
01:50:44,101 --> 01:50:45,221
And now what?

1421
01:51:02,555 --> 01:51:05,775
I know dark clouds will gather 'round me,

1422
01:51:12,100 --> 01:51:16,253
I know my way is rough and steep.

1423
01:51:21,504 --> 01:51:24,864
Yet green fields lie just before me,

1424
01:51:31,252 --> 01:51:36,192
Where rebellion we will reap.

1425
01:52:19,260 --> 01:52:24,250
I am a poor wayfaring stranger,

1426
01:52:29,046 --> 01:52:36,926
Wandering through this world of woe,

1427
01:52:38,486 --> 01:52:43,766
And there's no sickness,
no toil or danger,

1428
01:52:48,316 --> 01:52:53,496
In that bright land to which I go.

1429
01:52:58,153 --> 01:53:01,183
I'm going there to see my brother,

1430
01:53:02,805 --> 01:53:06,985
I’m going there no more to roam.

1431
01:53:08,149 --> 01:53:11,689
I'm only going over Firdaus,

1432
01:53:12,588 --> 01:53:16,298
