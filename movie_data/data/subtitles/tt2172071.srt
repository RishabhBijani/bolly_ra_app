1
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:46,416
<i>Years pass, but there are some days in
our lives which we just can't forget.</i>

2
00:01:46,833 --> 00:01:48,541
<i>That was one such day.</i>

3
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:50,875
<i>The last day of
the "Student of the Year" competition.</i>

4
00:01:56,375 --> 00:01:59,541
<i>Just like any other competition,
there was one winner.</i>

5
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:05,500
{\an8}<i>But all of us lost something that day.</i>

6
00:02:08,125 --> 00:02:11,500
<i>But the biggest loss that day
was Dean Yoginder Vasisht's.</i>

7
00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:15,500
<i>He started this competition 25 years ago.</i>

8
00:02:17,166 --> 00:02:20,458
<i>That was Dean Yoginder Vasisht's
last year at St. Teresa's.</i>

9
00:02:24,708 --> 00:02:25,708
<i>After that day, he left...</i>

10
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:28,000
<i>and made a separate world
for himself far from everyone.</i>

11
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,875
<i>Except for our Coach, Mr. Shah,
no one else had access to this world.</i>

12
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,166
<i>But I could never forget him.</i>

13
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:41,791
<i>I always wondered where he was,
how he must be.</i>

14
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:44,875
<i>One question kept
bothering me all the time.</i>

15
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:47,250
<i>Did all of this happen
because of me?</i>

16
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:56,625
<i>And ten years later,
I got a chance to find the answer.</i>

17
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:12,958
Hi! How are you? Of course, I remember.

18
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:14,166
Tell me.

19
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,500
Tell everyone? Okay.
I will tell everyone.

20
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:30,708
No, I don't need their contact numbers.
I'll get them from Facebook.

21
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:33,541
Okay. I will be there.

22
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:49,875
Haven't spoken to anyone in ten years.

23
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:54,750
I will call all of them, but...
so much has happened.

24
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:57,125
I don't think everyone will come.

25
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:15,166
Who's this... Sudo?

26
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:43,791
{\an8}I was wrong. All of them are coming.

27
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:45,083
{\an8}Because like me, all of them

28
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:47,416
{\an8}have been searching
for the answers to their questions.

29
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:50,458
{\an8}Probably, this is the last
chance for all of us...

30
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:52,125
to learn the truth.

31
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:04,333
{\an8}I will call you as soon as I reach, okay?

32
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:05,916
{\an8}She still has a bit of a flu.

33
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:07,708
{\an8}The doctor's number is written there.

34
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:09,500
{\an8}Don't forget to give her the medicines.

35
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:13,250
{\an8}Okay, Mom. Bye!

36
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:45,791
{\an8}- Hey, Jeet! How are you?
- Good.

37
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:49,083
{\an8}- Hi, brother.
- Hey, Dimpy! How are you?

38
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,166
{\an8}I'm fine... and you?

39
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,375
{\an8}I'm good.
Heard you have become a big coach.

40
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:54,458
{\an8}Yes, in the girls' school.

41
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:56,291
{\an8}You have also become a big lawyer.

42
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:57,500
{\an8}Yes. A big lawyer.

43
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:05,833
{\an8}Brother, I'll be back.

44
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:12,208
{\an8}Ma'am! Extension line, please.

45
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,958
{\an8}Awkward meeting... after ten years.

46
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,666
{\an8}Today, they are all greeting
each other and air kissing.

47
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:20,583
{\an8}Ten years ago,
they wanted to kill each other.

48
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:27,666
{\an8}Yes, sir. Only four of them are here.
Yes. So, are you coming?

49
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:29,416
{\an8}Okay, sir. See you, soon.

50
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:36,375
{\an8}He was devastated after
the prize distribution of your batch.

51
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:41,750
{\an8}He felt he was responsible for each
broken relationship of every batch.

52
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:46,750
{\an8}Yours was the last batch,
so he remembered you often.

53
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:49,000
{\an8}Especially Rohan and Abhi.

54
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:52,333
<i>He felt as proud of their
every achievement...</i>

55
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:56,750
<i>as he felt regret
for what happened with them.</i>

56
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:01,458
<i>He kept withering with that regret and...</i>

57
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,625
I never thought I would see
Dean Vasisht in this state.

58
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,333
I can't believe this is
the same happy face that

59
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:39,041
welcomed us every morning
with a "Hello, boys and girls!"

60
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:42,500
Those were the days.

61
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:44,791
I wish those days could come back.

62
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:50,291
I would change so many things...
that I said, that I did.

63
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:54,875
I wanted to be
the school's head cheerleader.

64
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:58,125
I became that. But yes, I have one regret.

65
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:00,833
I wish things would have
worked out with Rohan.

66
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:04,625
Rohan... I was his biggest minion.

67
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:06,833
I mistook it for friendship.

68
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:10,041
But Rohan has only one friend.
I mean, he had.

69
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:17,666
Younger scion of Delhi's business
tycoon, Ashok Nanda.

70
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:22,416
He had taken an admission in St. Teresa's,
but wasting time was his major.

71
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,416
<i>He wanted to be
the world's biggest rock star!</i>

72
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:28,208
<i>My dad says...</i>

73
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:33,416
<i>I'll make it big one day</i>

74
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:38,708
<i>His son will...</i>

75
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:43,958
<i>Make him proud</i>

76
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:48,208
<i>But nobody...</i>

77
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:52,125
<i>Knows this</i>

78
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:25,250
One thing was sure.

79
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:28,958
The only property he would inherit from
his father was going to be the guitar.

80
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:32,458
He wasn't your big fan either.

81
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:35,875
I don't know what my best friend was
doing with him for so many years.

82
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:44,166
The only daughter of her mother
and her stepdad's fifth.

83
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:46,791
The most beautiful girl of St. Teresa's.

84
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:15,583
<i>When they saw my beautiful eyes</i>

85
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:19,125
<i>All of them went crazy</i>

86
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:23,958
<i>Control yourself, you poor boys</i>

87
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:27,500
<i>You might just fall for me</i>

88
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:39,541
<i>Everyone knows...</i>

89
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:43,708
<i>That I'm number one</i>

90
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:48,000
<i>The world follows me</i>

91
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:52,125
<i>I'm ahead of everyone as I'm number one</i>

92
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:13,833
<i>When they saw my beautiful eyes</i>

93
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:17,583
<i>All of them went crazy</i>

94
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:22,083
<i>Control yourself, you poor boys</i>

95
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:25,958
<i>You might just fall for me</i>

96
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,375
<i>Unfortunately,
no designer label was selling love.</i>

97
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,500
Or, Shanaya would have
bought the whole counter.

98
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,541
- Where were you?
- In jail.

99
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:43,916
- Shanaya, talk to your sister properly.
- She is not my sister, Mom.

100
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,250
She is your husband's daughter.

101
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,791
- Did you see my boyfriend?
- Yes... there.

102
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:56,625
I'll be back.

103
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:08,666
You do know that wine
stains are permanent, right?

104
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:11,583
Thank you for the washing-machine tip!

105
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:13,708
You'll need it.

106
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:19,916
What are you doing?

107
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:22,125
Rohan, if you don't change
your antics this term...

108
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:23,583
I will leave you.

109
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,583
You look sexier when you threaten me.

110
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:48,375
Like its name, it was an English school.

111
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:50,583
<i>Built 100 years ago by the Britishers...</i>

112
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:52,375
<i>and run by the Deans post-independence.</i>

113
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:56,750
<i>The top professionals of every field
in the world were St. T's students.</i>

114
00:12:57,666 --> 00:13:01,666
It wasn't a normal school.
It was a different world.

115
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:05,458
<i>And the most unique
specimen of that world...</i>

116
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:11,000
The most dynamic Dean of St. Teresa's.

117
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:21,041
He looked cute, but he was scary.

118
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:26,375
The only person who could
scare him was his mother.

119
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:33,333
I'll just say that it was a posh school.

120
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:36,416
Under the rule of Dean Vasisht,
it was divided into two parts.

121
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,333
Tata Students and Bata Students.

122
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:41,583
Tata students would spend
money to get an admission,

123
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:44,708
while Bata students used to
swot up for the scholarship.

124
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:47,041
And then, entered Abhimanyu.

125
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:50,500
He shook the Tata students to the core
and elevated the Bata students' status.

126
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:09,875
<i>Nobody knows where he has come from</i>

127
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:13,333
<i>Everyone's heart skips a beat</i>

128
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:16,375
<i>Nobody knows where he has come from</i>

129
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,125
<i>Everyone's heart skips a beat</i>

130
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:22,750
<i>He is cool and wonderful</i>

131
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:25,166
<i>On seeing him, the girls go crazy</i>

132
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:38,208
<i>He is better than the rest</i>

133
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:40,541
<i>On seeing him, the boys also go crazy</i>

134
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:52,291
<i>He is tall and handsome</i>

135
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:55,958
<i>He casts a spell on everyone</i>

136
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:59,250
<i>The boy is amazing</i>

137
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:03,125
<i>The boy is amazing</i>

138
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:09,625
<i>Of all the boys, he is the most amazing</i>

139
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:13,250
<i>The boy is amazing</i>

140
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:16,916
<i>The boy is amazing</i>

141
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:23,708
<i>His sexy antics woo girls,
He is the most amazing</i>

142
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:59,208
<i>The boy is amazing</i>

143
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:05,833
<i>The boy is amazing</i>

144
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:09,416
<i>Act cool, but remember</i>

145
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:13,125
<i>This is temporary</i>

146
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:19,791
<i>Your magic will fade soon</i>

147
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:23,125
<i>Start counting your days</i>

148
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:26,583
<i>You can plead, but you can't be one of us</i>

149
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:30,791
<i>I am the leader and they all follow me</i>

150
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:35,125
<i>The boy is amazing</i>

151
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:38,750
<i>The boy is amazing</i>

152
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:43,958
<i>His sexy antics woo girls,
He is the most amazing</i>

153
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,375
<i>The boy is amazing</i>

154
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:51,083
<i>The boy is amazing</i>

155
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:57,750
<i>Of all the boys, he is the most amazing</i>

156
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:03,375
Hey!

157
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:06,791
Hey, you! Hero!
Move your Honda or get an LIC policy.

158
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
- This is Rohan Nanda's parking spot.
- So?

159
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:12,250
It's Rohan Nanda.
Ashok Nanda is his father. He is his son.

160
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:14,750
So, why are you overacting?
Aren't you your father's son?

161
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:17,875
Shut up, you TV serial!

162
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:20,541
Enough with your drama!
Look, there's the film.

163
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:33,000
What's this, Dimpy?

164
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:34,791
Don't you get enough
money to keep watch?

165
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:36,000
Move this junk from here!

166
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:39,375
Not you, Sudo!
I was talking about this junk.

167
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:40,833
It's called a bike.

168
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:41,958
Really?

169
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:44,541
- What did you say your name was?
- I didn't say.

170
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:46,791
Hey, quiz show!
Are you going to give four options now?

171
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:48,250
Tell us your name!

172
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:53,791
- Abhimanyu.
- Abhimanyu, listen carefully!

173
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:55,375
This is my parking spot.

174
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:57,291
It'd be better if you
take this tractor's

175
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:58,625
brother back to the fields.

176
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:01,458
My car has a standard.

177
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,791
You are right. Your car is top-class.

178
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:14,916
Hey, are you a human or Google?

179
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,916
Were you a mechanic back in your village?

180
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:19,375
No, valet at a nightclub!

181
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:25,541
Let me do you a favor.
Take this and park my car.

182
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:28,458
And here, 500 rupees!
Get your bike cleaned.

183
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:31,208
Listen! Keep the change.

184
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:35,833
Where do they come from!
Village bums.

185
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:18,458
Here is your 500. Get your car cleaned.

186
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:21,541
And, listen! Keep the change.

187
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:28,750
<i>Fights and more fights!</i>

188
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:32,958
Boys love to fight, right?

189
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:36,791
It gives them a chance
to display their machismo.

190
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:50,041
Fighting, arguing...
all this is against St. T's rules.

191
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:53,916
In this campus, if there is any
violence allowed... it's by me!

192
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:03,000
So, now, will you please tell me...

193
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:05,291
who started this fight?

194
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:07,666
- He took my parking spot.
- Does your father own that spot?

195
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:10,125
Yes, he does. Half the school
runs with my dad's trust fund.

196
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:15,083
- You must be paying my salary as well?
- No, sir.

197
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:16,958
Exactly! That's not the case, Rohan Nanda.

198
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:24,666
You love running fast, right?

199
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:27,541
You will find yourself running as
fast out of this campus...

200
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:30,875
if you repeat this cheap
hooliganism again. Get it?

201
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:42,625
Your father, the rich and royal
Ashok Nanda is visiting.

202
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:52,416
Am I pretty?

203
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:56,000
Why are you staring at me then?

204
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:07,708
<i>- Is our Dean like that?
- Like what?</i>

205
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:11,000
Like the ones who prefer a shortcut
rather than a highway.

206
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:12,791
He is a Dean, not a taxi.

207
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,958
Come on! He used to stare
at Coach all the time.

208
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:17,541
What are you saying?

209
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:58,791
Wow! Is that your name
or the canteen's menu?

210
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:06,541
Listen! All of us scholar students
give you a grand salute.

211
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:09,416
- You shook up the ABCs as you entered.
- ABCs?

212
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:12,375
Yes. Affluent Brats and their Companions.

213
00:22:12,458 --> 00:22:14,541
Look, how they are staring at you!

214
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,500
I'm not scared of anyone.

215
00:22:16,583 --> 00:22:18,625
Hey, where are you going?

216
00:22:18,958 --> 00:22:20,833
That seat is empty.

217
00:22:21,083 --> 00:22:22,291
So is your pocket!

218
00:22:22,666 --> 00:22:25,333
Just sit with the nerdy gang.
Stay in your limits!

219
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:27,833
I'm going to make the first move.
Want to join?

220
00:22:28,125 --> 00:22:28,958
No, thanks!

221
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:52,833
New term, new dreams
and a new challenge for all of you.

222
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:58,375
I started this competition 25 years ago.

223
00:22:59,041 --> 00:23:02,625
There's only one out of you,
who will win the trophy.

224
00:23:03,583 --> 00:23:05,708
The only one who'll go
for higher studies...

225
00:23:06,041 --> 00:23:08,750
to an International Ivy League college.

226
00:23:09,208 --> 00:23:13,333
He will be sponsored
by St. T's trust fund.

227
00:23:29,958 --> 00:23:31,500
Your dad looks dashing.

228
00:23:48,125 --> 00:23:49,625
I can do two things right now.

229
00:23:49,791 --> 00:23:52,958
One, I can share some
bookish knowledge with you.

230
00:23:53,625 --> 00:23:56,250
Or, I can get real with you about life.

231
00:23:57,083 --> 00:23:59,125
Because no one has made money till date

232
00:23:59,208 --> 00:24:00,875
by either reading or teaching textbooks.

233
00:24:01,625 --> 00:24:05,875
If that was possible, your teaching
faculty would have been here

234
00:24:05,958 --> 00:24:07,791
and I would have been there...
in their place.

235
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:17,750
Teachers teach rules...

236
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:23,125
but winners make them.

237
00:24:29,916 --> 00:24:31,541
If you want to play, be attentive.

238
00:24:40,958 --> 00:24:43,375
The whole school is talking
about your football skills.

239
00:24:44,083 --> 00:24:46,458
- Don't you want to play for the team?
- I do, sir.

240
00:24:46,875 --> 00:24:48,250
So, why didn't you ask?

241
00:24:49,083 --> 00:24:50,750
Borrowed things have to be returned, sir.

242
00:24:51,041 --> 00:24:52,083
I want to earn it.

243
00:24:53,083 --> 00:24:55,458
It's football, not lottery.

244
00:24:59,416 --> 00:25:02,333
Let's see if your dribbling skills
are as sharp as your tongue.

245
00:25:46,291 --> 00:25:47,875
This Abhimanyu must be shown his place.

246
00:25:48,041 --> 00:25:49,541
Why? Hasn't he settled in his room?

247
00:25:50,541 --> 00:25:51,916
He was showing off on the field today.

248
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,375
But, boss... he's good at the game.

249
00:25:54,875 --> 00:25:57,458
You are also good.
There's nothing great about that.

250
00:25:57,833 --> 00:25:59,750
Some games must be played off the field.

251
00:26:00,041 --> 00:26:01,958
Go and get the keys for the notice board.

252
00:26:02,916 --> 00:26:03,833
Just go, dude.

253
00:26:09,708 --> 00:26:11,708
- <i>Pind</i> level.
- What is <i>Pind</i> level?

254
00:26:12,166 --> 00:26:14,041
Used to play with the boys in the village.

255
00:26:14,125 --> 00:26:16,375
Really? That's why you play rough.

256
00:26:18,125 --> 00:26:20,000
Don't know about rough,
but my game is strong.

257
00:26:21,041 --> 00:26:24,041
Sometimes you tend to lose
form when you focus on style, right?

258
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:26,541
Listen, you village Beckham!

259
00:26:27,166 --> 00:26:28,833
Arrogance must have its boundaries.

260
00:26:28,916 --> 00:26:30,833
And here, I am the only
exception to that rule.

261
00:26:31,125 --> 00:26:33,250
Why? Are you the PM's son?

262
00:26:33,958 --> 00:26:34,958
You can say that.

263
00:26:36,333 --> 00:26:38,875
Don't worry... I will vote for your dad!

264
00:26:41,458 --> 00:26:43,458
So much anger... such arrogance...

265
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:45,583
It's not good for your health.

266
00:26:47,208 --> 00:26:48,625
Acting like my mother, are you?

267
00:26:48,708 --> 00:26:50,000
No, father!

268
00:26:51,125 --> 00:26:52,083
Your father!

269
00:26:54,791 --> 00:26:55,666
After the medical.

270
00:26:59,166 --> 00:27:03,166
It's written on the notice board...
in English. Read it.

271
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,500
- Dimpy.
- Yes?

272
00:27:15,875 --> 00:27:17,375
Give this to Coach.

273
00:27:17,541 --> 00:27:18,375
What's in it?

274
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:21,125
This has... my...

275
00:27:21,208 --> 00:27:22,041
Your?

276
00:27:23,291 --> 00:27:25,416
That thing... on the notice board. My...

277
00:27:25,875 --> 00:27:28,750
Why are you blushing like a bride?
Just give it.

278
00:27:29,458 --> 00:27:30,875
I'm going to Coach's
house, I'll give it to him.

279
00:27:31,375 --> 00:27:32,958
This time, it's free.
Pay the next time.

280
00:27:34,125 --> 00:27:34,958
Leave!

281
00:27:39,833 --> 00:27:41,791
God, I'm late. He must be asleep.

282
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,416
- Hey!
- Dimpy, listen! Just leave this.

283
00:27:44,541 --> 00:27:46,958
Listen! Munni is notorious, but not young.

284
00:27:47,041 --> 00:27:49,666
Sheila is young, but not notorious.
Why, Dimpy? Why?

285
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:52,125
How do I know? I'm a boy, not FM radio.

286
00:27:52,208 --> 00:27:54,250
- Just take this.
- Watch some TV.

287
00:27:55,375 --> 00:27:57,416
Silly rich kids and their minions!

288
00:27:59,083 --> 00:28:03,750
If I ring the bell, he will be angry.
I'll just leave it here.

289
00:28:18,208 --> 00:28:21,041
"Respected sir, thank you
from the bottom of my heart

290
00:28:21,125 --> 00:28:22,291
for selecting me in
the football team.

291
00:28:22,375 --> 00:28:23,958
I'm sending you some holy water."

292
00:28:24,166 --> 00:28:25,041
That's nice!

293
00:28:25,375 --> 00:28:30,000
"Hope it purifies your home
and your family just as it has mine.

294
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,125
Yours, Abhimanyu Singh."

295
00:28:32,333 --> 00:28:34,833
He is a sweet boy!
He has sent holy water.

296
00:28:35,291 --> 00:28:38,125
Holy water? Let me sprinkle
it through the entire house.

297
00:28:38,916 --> 00:28:41,250
You're so silly! My home is you.

298
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:49,791
And how can we forget our son?

299
00:28:50,125 --> 00:28:52,625
My son, live long!

300
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:55,416
Here... holy water. Keep it safe.

301
00:28:56,875 --> 00:28:57,875
It stinks!

302
00:28:58,333 --> 00:28:59,208
What happened?

303
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,375
It's urine.

304
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,875
Is this your prank
or someone else had a hand in this?

305
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:13,208
He must have done it.

306
00:29:13,916 --> 00:29:15,500
Why does he need someone else's hand?

307
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:21,125
Tell me.

308
00:29:27,791 --> 00:29:28,916
Sir, I did it.

309
00:29:33,166 --> 00:29:34,666
If you stop, start all over again.

310
00:29:39,125 --> 00:29:40,625
Hey, listen!

311
00:29:41,333 --> 00:29:43,458
Hey! Stop running and listen.

312
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:46,125
- Say it.
- I have a dance booking with Sudo.

313
00:29:46,541 --> 00:29:48,416
Give me 100 bucks and I'll
say you finished your rounds.

314
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,625
Give me 100 bucks and I will
say you watched me run.

315
00:29:50,833 --> 00:29:52,416
You will grow up to be a politician.

316
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:54,083
Did I ask for the bribe?

317
00:29:55,416 --> 00:29:56,833
Now, go! Scoundrel!

318
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:04,541
<i>Rohan always acted tough.</i>

319
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:06,458
But he was still compassionate.

320
00:30:11,541 --> 00:30:13,166
Hey, listen! I'm talking to you.

321
00:30:14,416 --> 00:30:18,583
Yes, Abhimanyu. Thanks for yesterday,
but you didn't have to save us.

322
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,416
- I know. I didn't have to.
- Then, why did you do it?

323
00:30:22,125 --> 00:30:23,291
I was trying to act great.

324
00:30:23,708 --> 00:30:25,583
Wanted to know how great people feel.

325
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,833
You know that you are a little
crazy, right?

326
00:30:28,416 --> 00:30:30,333
I am a little crazy,
but you are totally crazy.

327
00:30:31,541 --> 00:30:34,500
You have heard my dad.
It would rub off, wouldn't it?

328
00:30:34,875 --> 00:30:36,333
Your dad is not insane.

329
00:30:36,541 --> 00:30:38,458
He's just a little crooked...
and he should be.

330
00:30:38,958 --> 00:30:41,458
To reach that position,
you must be crooked.

331
00:30:41,583 --> 00:30:44,375
Wow! Gandhi in your hands
and such lofty thoughts?

332
00:30:46,125 --> 00:30:48,583
You'd rather have notes
with Gandhi's picture on it.

333
00:30:48,666 --> 00:30:49,958
God made a mistake.

334
00:30:50,333 --> 00:30:53,583
- You should have been my father's son.
- Why do you care so much about your dad?

335
00:30:53,666 --> 00:30:55,833
I don't. I don't care about anyone.

336
00:30:55,916 --> 00:30:56,791
You do.

337
00:30:56,875 --> 00:30:59,083
You want to earn his respect,
but he doesn't...

338
00:30:59,166 --> 00:31:01,916
- want to loan it to you.
- Wow!

339
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,291
Now, you are an expert in
the parents' philosophy as well?

340
00:31:04,916 --> 00:31:07,750
Yes, I have become one... after they left.

341
00:31:07,916 --> 00:31:09,000
Left? On a holiday?

342
00:31:12,875 --> 00:31:14,791
Don't get emotional.
Yours are alive. Come on!

343
00:31:14,916 --> 00:31:19,500
- Scoundrel! You do know you are a big...
- Yes, I know.

344
00:31:19,583 --> 00:31:22,000
A big asshole, right?

345
00:31:27,958 --> 00:31:29,916
Let's go! Come with me to the canteen.
It's time.

346
00:31:30,208 --> 00:31:31,541
- Time for what?
- Shanaya.

347
00:31:35,083 --> 00:31:38,541
This year, the head cheerleader
for the football team is...

348
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:44,458
You must be feeling terrible.

349
00:31:44,541 --> 00:31:46,250
Because this position is normally given to

350
00:31:46,333 --> 00:31:48,166
the most popular girl in the school?

351
00:31:49,916 --> 00:31:53,958
To hold pom-pom in hands and scream
for the boys is not my style.

352
00:31:54,541 --> 00:31:57,166
If they scream for me... or whistle...

353
00:32:14,041 --> 00:32:17,833
<i>This beautiful face, these tresses...</i>

354
00:32:20,833 --> 00:32:24,916
<i>These deep eyes hide a big secret</i>

355
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,458
<i>This beautiful face, these tresses</i>

356
00:32:31,541 --> 00:32:34,916
<i>These deep eyes hide a big secret</i>

357
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:41,000
<i>How do I praise your creator?</i>

358
00:32:43,833 --> 00:32:49,791
<i>How do I praise your creator?</i>

359
00:33:03,291 --> 00:33:09,250
<i>How do I praise your creator?</i>

360
00:33:26,916 --> 00:33:28,708
So much love? So much attention?

361
00:33:28,833 --> 00:33:30,666
Is everything okay with you?

362
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:31,833
Yes, everything is fine.

363
00:33:31,916 --> 00:33:33,541
Or you just want to show the whole world

364
00:33:33,625 --> 00:33:35,500
that you are still Shanaya
Singhania's boyfriend?

365
00:33:35,583 --> 00:33:38,291
You would have made such a good boy.

366
00:33:38,375 --> 00:33:40,416
God fell asleep and you were born a girl.

367
00:33:41,833 --> 00:33:43,208
I think you are asleep.

368
00:33:43,791 --> 00:33:45,833
That's why you can't see your competition.

369
00:33:47,833 --> 00:33:50,541
Oh, so you are the new
boy in the school.

370
00:33:51,666 --> 00:33:53,375
As if you didn't notice before.

371
00:33:53,958 --> 00:33:56,625
Just saw you. Notice?
Don't be delusional.

372
00:33:56,708 --> 00:33:57,833
Come, let's sit.

373
00:33:57,916 --> 00:33:58,958
Jeet... chair!

374
00:34:00,166 --> 00:34:01,708
Not for you... for Shanaya.

375
00:34:08,958 --> 00:34:11,375
Don't! She's my girlfriend.

376
00:34:12,333 --> 00:34:15,250
She's not my type.
I have a different plan.

377
00:34:15,416 --> 00:34:16,583
Whatever your plan is...

378
00:34:16,875 --> 00:34:19,458
I'm just happy that I have
a worthy rival in school.

379
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:25,791
What?

380
00:34:26,291 --> 00:34:28,750
Friction, friendship, love, jealousy...

381
00:34:28,958 --> 00:34:30,625
this was St. T's daily routine.

382
00:34:31,166 --> 00:34:34,791
But every second weekend all
of us used to get a reality check...

383
00:34:35,291 --> 00:34:38,833
when we used to go home...
into our real world.

384
00:34:43,625 --> 00:34:46,625
- Do you think we'll have mid-term polls?
- There are chances.

385
00:34:47,041 --> 00:34:48,750
Our stocks have just stabilized.

386
00:34:49,083 --> 00:34:51,333
- If there are mid-term polls...
- Dad, I think...

387
00:34:51,416 --> 00:34:52,250
Hold on!

388
00:34:53,958 --> 00:34:54,833
You think?

389
00:34:56,291 --> 00:34:58,541
When did you develop this new hobby?

390
00:34:59,375 --> 00:35:01,041
It's our job to think in this house.

391
00:35:01,375 --> 00:35:02,541
You just strum the guitar.

392
00:35:04,875 --> 00:35:08,041
Hey! It was a joke.
You are also important in this family.

393
00:35:08,125 --> 00:35:09,333
You will decide which band

394
00:35:09,416 --> 00:35:12,625
- will play at my wedding, right?
- Enough.

395
00:35:12,708 --> 00:35:13,750
Stop now!

396
00:35:15,916 --> 00:35:19,750
I think it will be a year
or two before we stabilize.

397
00:35:20,583 --> 00:35:22,541
Ashok Nanda is an influential man
all over India.

398
00:35:23,541 --> 00:35:25,875
Don't give up on your
friendship with Rohan.

399
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:28,416
He got you into the school.

400
00:35:28,916 --> 00:35:30,416
He will be of use in
the future as well.

401
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:34,125
What's that supposed to mean?
I also have a unique personality.

402
00:35:34,208 --> 00:35:38,125
Shut up, you idiot!
A man is either a minion or a leader.

403
00:35:39,083 --> 00:35:41,041
And you are just like your father.

404
00:35:41,166 --> 00:35:45,333
A minion! You don't have
it in you to be a leader.

405
00:35:46,833 --> 00:35:47,833
Shut up!

406
00:35:51,333 --> 00:35:54,333
"I believe the stocks of your
husband's company have fallen."

407
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:57,791
So what if the stocks fell?

408
00:35:58,125 --> 00:36:00,041
We've still got the money.

409
00:36:00,125 --> 00:36:01,333
I'm pregnant.

410
00:36:11,791 --> 00:36:14,208
Shanaya's father is back in the headlines.

411
00:36:15,208 --> 00:36:17,125
I hope you are taking good care of her.

412
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,333
I'm her friend, not her security guard!

413
00:36:23,708 --> 00:36:26,833
- Everything alright in school, Abhi?
- Yes, Uncle.

414
00:36:28,375 --> 00:36:31,083
I needed some money
for the science project.

415
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:33,958
Of course! Mr. Richie Rich...

416
00:36:34,333 --> 00:36:37,500
withdraw some money from your
Swiss bank account and give it to him?

417
00:36:37,583 --> 00:36:38,833
Stop it!

418
00:36:38,916 --> 00:36:40,416
I will give you the money
tomorrow, my son.

419
00:36:43,625 --> 00:36:45,583
There's no salt in the food today.

420
00:36:45,666 --> 00:36:48,875
I guess... it's okay.

421
00:36:51,791 --> 00:36:53,958
Is Shanaya still Rohan's girlfriend?

422
00:36:55,875 --> 00:36:57,958
I've got you some
push-up bras from London.

423
00:36:58,416 --> 00:36:59,666
Are you wearing them?

424
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,958
I will win
the "Student of the Year" trophy.

425
00:37:15,458 --> 00:37:19,500
Very good... but who are you?

426
00:37:20,875 --> 00:37:22,125
I'm Kaizad.

427
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,500
Why are you massaging like a girl?
Do it harder!

428
00:37:54,666 --> 00:37:56,083
I can't do it harder than this.

429
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:01,041
They say if you press certain points
in your body, it helps with the pain.

430
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:04,041
I think your wife is
troubling you at home.

431
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:07,750
She loves me a lot.

432
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:12,625
I'm a bit concerned with the captaincy
of the football team.

433
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:16,333
Between Rohan and Abhimanyu.

434
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:19,666
Well... Rohan's dad is
a childhood friend of mine.

435
00:38:19,916 --> 00:38:21,625
We grew up together.

436
00:38:24,125 --> 00:38:27,458
But you aren't suggesting I make
Rohan the captain because of that, right?

437
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:32,000
I don't care who the captain is.

438
00:38:32,083 --> 00:38:34,416
We must defeat St. Lawrence.

439
00:38:35,166 --> 00:38:37,250
They have been winning
consistently for 25 years.

440
00:38:37,583 --> 00:38:39,791
And their mean Dean, Harkisan Sanan...

441
00:38:41,708 --> 00:38:43,750
he has been torturing me for years now.

442
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:49,500
<i>Hello, what's up!</i>

443
00:38:52,166 --> 00:38:55,875
Last year, when you arrived,
I felt you are the one...

444
00:38:56,333 --> 00:38:58,583
who will seek revenge for all
the things done to me.

445
00:39:01,166 --> 00:39:02,125
You will, won't you?

446
00:39:16,583 --> 00:39:20,500
After much thought, I have decided that...

447
00:39:21,708 --> 00:39:24,125
the captain of
the St. T's football team...

448
00:39:25,958 --> 00:39:26,916
is Jeet Khurana.

449
00:39:27,458 --> 00:39:29,666
What was my mistake, sir?

450
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:32,958
You heard me, right?
You are the captain this year.

451
00:39:33,291 --> 00:39:35,208
And we must win at any cost this year!

452
00:39:35,333 --> 00:39:37,750
Is that why we chose Jeet?

453
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,708
I would have made
a better captain than you...

454
00:39:40,791 --> 00:39:42,833
Hey! There can only be
one football on the field!

455
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,291
Then came the day,
when a lot of things began.

456
00:39:46,375 --> 00:39:47,625
And a lot of things ended.

457
00:40:00,916 --> 00:40:03,416
Get ready to lose!
We have been winning for 24 years.

458
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,708
This year will be the silver
jubilee of kicking your ass...

459
00:40:05,791 --> 00:40:07,916
Not this year, Harkisan Sanan.

460
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:10,166
My boys are fully prepared this year.

461
00:40:10,541 --> 00:40:12,625
St. T's losers... what will they do...

462
00:40:16,833 --> 00:40:19,791
Coach, Mr. Shah, has trained them.

463
00:40:22,208 --> 00:40:24,708
The gossip says that
you have been saying...

464
00:40:25,916 --> 00:40:27,000
"Coach!" a lot these days.

465
00:40:28,333 --> 00:40:33,291
<i>What do I do, Coach?
I feel butterflies in my tummy</i>

466
00:41:23,791 --> 00:41:28,000
Half time! St. Lawrence, two
and we as usual zero. Nil.

467
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:38,291
Wonder why Coach was using
such complicated language!

468
00:41:40,791 --> 00:41:43,166
He just should have said, "Be Punjabi!"

469
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:44,583
The boys would have got it!

470
00:44:27,708 --> 00:44:28,750
Hey, you...

471
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:31,541
- Hope you won't kiss me now.
- I won't even hug you.

472
00:44:38,041 --> 00:44:39,125
<i>We had to win.</i>

473
00:44:39,291 --> 00:44:42,625
- I was the captain, after all.
- We didn't win because of you.

474
00:44:42,708 --> 00:44:45,833
- We won because of Rohan and Abhi.
- Coach was a smart man.

475
00:44:45,916 --> 00:44:48,375
He made you the captain, so there's no
ego tussle between the two of them.

476
00:44:48,458 --> 00:44:50,708
What ego? It was Abhi's arrogance
that came between them.

477
00:44:50,958 --> 00:44:52,041
The winning goal was Abhi's,

478
00:44:52,125 --> 00:44:55,583
but he deliberately let Rohan score it.
This was all Abhi's plan.

479
00:44:56,416 --> 00:44:59,333
- He wanted to replace me.
- Abhi didn't want to be a minion, Jeet.

480
00:44:59,583 --> 00:45:01,208
He wanted to be Rohan's friend.

481
00:45:01,333 --> 00:45:04,791
Small-town boys know
how to make contacts.

482
00:45:04,875 --> 00:45:07,083
Not that big-city girls are any less.

483
00:45:07,541 --> 00:45:09,291
You were also Shanaya's body part.

484
00:45:09,666 --> 00:45:11,000
Hanging on to her for life!

485
00:45:12,958 --> 00:45:14,583
Saw your best friendship!

486
00:45:16,375 --> 00:45:18,000
I'm telling you this was all Abhi's plan.

487
00:45:18,083 --> 00:45:20,416
Listen, we don't know if it
was his plan or not.

488
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,875
All we know is that the gates
of their friendship opened that day.

489
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:34,000
This is Abhi. Abhimanyu.

490
00:45:34,083 --> 00:45:36,833
- Hello, Auntie!
- Welcome, son. Dad was looking for you.

491
00:45:36,916 --> 00:45:38,791
For me? Why? Is he ill?

492
00:45:38,875 --> 00:45:40,208
Come on, Rohan!

493
00:45:43,166 --> 00:45:45,875
Sir, just do this much for me...

494
00:45:45,958 --> 00:45:48,083
- Dad, he is...
- I'll send a big suitcase to thank you.

495
00:45:48,833 --> 00:45:49,666
Yes.

496
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:55,375
- Will you have something?
- No.

497
00:45:57,541 --> 00:45:59,416
- Dad, this is my friend...
- Abhimanyu, right?

498
00:46:03,208 --> 00:46:04,750
We are celebrating today.

499
00:46:04,833 --> 00:46:06,416
Thanks to Rohan, we won the match.

500
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:09,333
Thanks to Rohan?
Really? I can't believe it.

501
00:46:09,833 --> 00:46:13,208
Dad never praises anyone... especially me.

502
00:46:13,666 --> 00:46:16,291
If you want praises, then learn
to earn them. Do something big.

503
00:46:16,875 --> 00:46:19,333
Win the "Student of the Year" trophy
and we will talk.

504
00:46:20,041 --> 00:46:22,041
You won't be happy then either, Dad.

505
00:46:25,625 --> 00:46:26,833
Tell me, Abhimanyu.

506
00:46:27,333 --> 00:46:29,000
Don't you want to win the trophy?

507
00:46:29,541 --> 00:46:31,666
It's already mine, sir.
Just has to reach home.

508
00:46:33,416 --> 00:46:34,541
This is what I like.

509
00:46:36,291 --> 00:46:37,583
I'm pleased to meet you.

510
00:46:38,166 --> 00:46:40,083
Tell me.
What do you want to be in life?

511
00:46:40,458 --> 00:46:41,500
I want to be you, sir.

512
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:44,375
Like you, I come from a small town.

513
00:46:44,458 --> 00:46:46,666
Like you, I bagged
the admission through scholarship.

514
00:46:47,083 --> 00:46:49,166
I want to work in your company, so that...

515
00:46:49,250 --> 00:46:51,000
I can be a bigger
business tycoon than you.

516
00:46:57,458 --> 00:47:02,083
Look at some, who want
to change the world with a guitar.

517
00:47:02,666 --> 00:47:04,958
I hope, some of your spirit
rubs off on Rohan.

518
00:47:05,041 --> 00:47:07,458
So, he can become someone.

519
00:47:08,333 --> 00:47:10,166
I don't know what I will be in life...

520
00:47:10,250 --> 00:47:12,916
but I sure will be
a better Dad than you... Dad!

521
00:47:13,458 --> 00:47:14,333
Let's go, Abhi!

522
00:47:27,625 --> 00:47:29,750
<i>We are all jobless</i>

523
00:47:29,833 --> 00:47:32,000
<i>Come, join us</i>

524
00:47:32,083 --> 00:47:34,166
<i>We are all jobless</i>

525
00:47:34,250 --> 00:47:36,666
<i>Come, join us</i>

526
00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:41,083
<i>We are all jobless
Come, join us</i>

527
00:47:41,166 --> 00:47:45,000
<i>We are all jobless
Come, join us</i>

528
00:47:45,083 --> 00:47:49,958
<i>In our cars, rocking music plays
Let's enjoy the moments</i>

529
00:47:50,083 --> 00:47:54,333
<i>Let's spend the evening having fun</i>

530
00:47:54,416 --> 00:47:58,833
<i>Elders complain that we play mischief</i>

531
00:47:58,916 --> 00:48:02,750
<i>-We friends don't care for the world
-We friends don't care for the world</i>

532
00:48:02,833 --> 00:48:07,625
<i>-They call us jobless
-But it doesn't matter</i>

533
00:48:07,708 --> 00:48:11,708
<i>-Our future is bright
-Our future is bright</i>

534
00:48:12,041 --> 00:48:16,500
<i>-They call us jobless
-But it doesn't matter</i>

535
00:48:16,583 --> 00:48:21,041
<i>When with friends, everything is all right</i>

536
00:48:42,916 --> 00:48:47,083
<i>Everyone sees our friendship</i>

537
00:48:47,166 --> 00:48:51,541
<i>They call us crazy</i>

538
00:48:51,666 --> 00:48:56,708
<i>We roam proudly</i>

539
00:48:56,791 --> 00:49:00,583
<i>This friendship is forever</i>

540
00:49:00,958 --> 00:49:05,333
<i>Let's drink to the heart's content</i>

541
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:09,791
<i>Let's check out girls</i>

542
00:49:09,875 --> 00:49:14,208
<i>-They call us jobless
-But it doesn't matter</i>

543
00:49:14,291 --> 00:49:18,333
<i>Our future is bright</i>

544
00:49:18,666 --> 00:49:23,250
<i>-They call us jobless
-But it doesn't matter</i>

545
00:49:23,333 --> 00:49:27,833
<i>When with friends, everything is all right</i>

546
00:49:54,041 --> 00:49:55,291
<i>We're the jobless guys</i>

547
00:50:06,083 --> 00:50:07,625
Do you miss your parents?

548
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:14,416
Yes.

549
00:50:15,375 --> 00:50:16,416
I also miss mine.

550
00:50:20,916 --> 00:50:25,291
We'll talk about Queen Radha's story.
She says...

551
00:50:30,916 --> 00:50:32,083
Breasts.

552
00:50:35,125 --> 00:50:36,583
- Buttocks.
- What?

553
00:50:38,791 --> 00:50:42,041
You two gentlemen, stand up! Stand up!

554
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:48,250
<i>We get excited as our hearts thump loudly</i>

555
00:50:48,333 --> 00:50:52,666
<i>When girls meet their eyes with ours</i>

556
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:57,791
<i>They kiss us, they say they miss us</i>

557
00:50:57,875 --> 00:51:02,166
<i>They give us their hearts,
They give us their lives</i>

558
00:51:02,250 --> 00:51:06,666
<i>We drive fast before girls</i>

559
00:51:06,750 --> 00:51:10,833
<i>We honk and wave them goodbye</i>

560
00:51:10,958 --> 00:51:15,541
<i>-They call us jobless
-But it doesn't matter</i>

561
00:51:15,625 --> 00:51:19,583
<i>Our future is bright</i>

562
00:51:19,666 --> 00:51:24,166
<i>-They call us jobless
-But it doesn't matter</i>

563
00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:28,958
<i>When with friends, everything is all right</i>

564
00:51:29,041 --> 00:51:33,083
<i>We are all jobless
Come, join us</i>

565
00:51:33,166 --> 00:51:37,625
<i>We are all jobless
Come, join us</i>

566
00:51:37,708 --> 00:51:39,666
<i>We are all jobless
Come, join us</i>

567
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:41,208
Do you love Shanaya?

568
00:51:41,791 --> 00:51:43,041
I'm confused.

569
00:51:43,625 --> 00:51:45,000
About Shanaya?

570
00:51:46,625 --> 00:51:48,000
About love.

571
00:51:48,750 --> 00:51:49,958
Are you gay?

572
00:51:51,041 --> 00:51:52,875
Yes. Come on! Come.

573
00:51:52,958 --> 00:51:55,000
Why are you asking questions
like a talk-show host?

574
00:51:55,083 --> 00:51:56,166
"Do you love Shanaya?"

575
00:51:56,458 --> 00:51:59,708
<i>We are all jobless
Come, join us</i>

576
00:51:59,791 --> 00:52:03,958
<i>We are all jobless
Come, join us</i>

577
00:52:26,583 --> 00:52:30,000
We came late last night,
so Rohan asked me to stay over.

578
00:52:31,666 --> 00:52:32,625
Come, sit.

579
00:52:34,041 --> 00:52:34,916
Hello, Auntie!

580
00:52:37,208 --> 00:52:38,750
The maestro is practicing.

581
00:52:40,291 --> 00:52:42,875
The noise that Rohan Nanda calls music.

582
00:52:43,875 --> 00:52:46,583
I was going to take suggestions
from Rohan for my wedding music.

583
00:52:48,541 --> 00:52:51,958
Wedding reminds me.
Ajay is getting married in Thailand.

584
00:52:54,583 --> 00:52:57,125
Your coach, Dean, Shanaya,
Tanya and their parents...

585
00:52:57,208 --> 00:52:58,166
everyone is coming.

586
00:53:03,333 --> 00:53:05,750
Rohan didn't mention anything about it.

587
00:53:06,041 --> 00:53:07,166
He hasn't been invited yet.

588
00:53:08,875 --> 00:53:10,791
Let's leave. We're getting late.

589
00:53:14,541 --> 00:53:16,583
Please, come. Sit! It's your house.

590
00:53:22,750 --> 00:53:24,291
I'm coming for your brother's wedding.

591
00:53:24,375 --> 00:53:26,833
- Mr. Nanda just invited me.
- Congratulations.

592
00:53:26,916 --> 00:53:29,291
He might give you a share
in his inheritance as well.

593
00:53:29,375 --> 00:53:31,041
That's what I'm aiming for.

594
00:53:31,125 --> 00:53:32,625
Don't forget, Dad will come with it.

595
00:53:33,291 --> 00:53:36,458
For this kind of a bank balance, I can
take Dad, Granddad and ancestors as well.

596
00:53:52,083 --> 00:53:53,333
Welcome to Thailand!

597
00:53:56,250 --> 00:53:57,125
Yes, Mr. Nanda.

598
00:53:57,208 --> 00:53:59,666
I have been on a diet for two weeks.

599
00:54:00,083 --> 00:54:01,458
Oh, I'm on a diet as well.

600
00:54:01,541 --> 00:54:03,750
Really? I can see that.

601
00:54:10,666 --> 00:54:12,166
- Can I tell him to...
- Yes.

602
00:54:14,375 --> 00:54:17,541
No, sir.
I was asking you to take our picture.

603
00:54:17,625 --> 00:54:19,666
Your picture? The light's not good!

604
00:54:23,958 --> 00:54:25,500
Where's the baggage?

605
00:54:26,750 --> 00:54:30,750
Baggage? Your clothes must
have fit in this handbag, right?

606
00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:43,166
<i>The boy's amazing</i>

607
00:54:44,708 --> 00:54:46,458
<i>The boy's amazing</i>

608
00:54:49,916 --> 00:54:51,416
<i>The boy's amazing</i>

609
00:55:07,833 --> 00:55:09,666
<i>- Thepla?</i>
- Oh! Good morning, <i>Thepla!</i>

610
00:55:09,750 --> 00:55:10,833
We have met before.

611
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:16,250
No. That's not my name.
I was offering it to you.

612
00:55:54,708 --> 00:55:55,750
What's the plan?

613
00:55:55,833 --> 00:55:58,000
Nothing.
She is massaging your back.

614
00:55:58,083 --> 00:55:59,458
Should I massage your neck?

615
00:56:00,625 --> 00:56:02,208
You are fond of massages, right?

616
00:56:02,291 --> 00:56:06,458
Rohan is so stressed.
I am just releasing his tension.

617
00:56:07,833 --> 00:56:09,708
Why don't you open a counter?

618
00:56:09,791 --> 00:56:12,750
All the Bangkok boys can come to you...
to release their tension.

619
00:56:14,125 --> 00:56:15,416
You are just being clingy, now!

620
00:56:16,083 --> 00:56:17,666
Why do you need to be so insecure?

621
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:19,458
I'm just chilling with friends.

622
00:56:19,541 --> 00:56:21,583
What am I doing wrong?
What is wrong?

623
00:56:23,625 --> 00:56:25,000
Nothing, Rohan. Nothing.

624
00:56:38,250 --> 00:56:39,333
He didn't come...

625
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:41,833
but sent his minion to wipe my tears.

626
00:56:42,041 --> 00:56:43,541
I'm no one's minion.

627
00:56:44,208 --> 00:56:45,791
I haven't come here to wipe your tears.

628
00:56:46,333 --> 00:56:47,625
Your nose is running.

629
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:53,583
You are the classy type.
Doesn't suit you.

630
00:56:56,916 --> 00:56:59,708
Now that I'm here, are you going
to tell me your tragic story...

631
00:56:59,791 --> 00:57:01,791
or are you just going to waste time?

632
00:57:04,708 --> 00:57:06,083
I'm fed up of Rohan.

633
00:57:06,791 --> 00:57:08,708
I've known him for ten years.

634
00:57:08,958 --> 00:57:10,750
I have been his girlfriend for four years.

635
00:57:10,833 --> 00:57:12,958
And for the last one year,
I have just been feeling

636
00:57:13,041 --> 00:57:14,500
that all of this is a big mistake.

637
00:57:15,833 --> 00:57:17,125
So, why don't you leave him?

638
00:57:18,250 --> 00:57:19,833
I don't like breaking relationships.

639
00:57:21,916 --> 00:57:24,208
Then, do something.
Get him on the right track.

640
00:57:25,708 --> 00:57:26,791
How?

641
00:57:27,625 --> 00:57:29,083
By taking the crooked route?

642
00:57:30,458 --> 00:57:31,500
Sorry?

643
00:57:37,666 --> 00:57:43,625
<i>Krishna roams around
With the village girls</i>

644
00:57:45,250 --> 00:57:47,833
<i>He plays and dances with them</i>

645
00:57:48,458 --> 00:57:54,416
<i>He doesn't stop</i>

646
00:57:55,458 --> 00:57:56,708
<i>Now...</i>

647
00:57:56,791 --> 00:58:02,750
<i>I don't like him</i>

648
00:58:32,375 --> 00:58:36,500
<i>The beloved holds my hand</i>

649
00:58:39,916 --> 00:58:44,000
<i>Krishna teases me</i>

650
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,083
<i>He may have won millions of hearts</i>

651
00:58:49,166 --> 00:58:53,958
<i>But I think he's crazy, as he says...</i>

652
00:58:54,041 --> 00:58:57,791
<i>O Radha, your scarf
O Radha, your ring</i>

653
00:58:57,875 --> 00:59:00,958
<i>O Radha, your naughty glance</i>

654
00:59:01,041 --> 00:59:04,875
<i>O Radha, your earring
O Radha, the shake of your waist</i>

655
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:08,333
<i>The whole town is after you</i>

656
00:59:08,416 --> 00:59:12,041
<i>O Radha, your scarf
O Radha, your ring</i>

657
00:59:12,125 --> 00:59:15,541
<i>O Radha, your naughty glance</i>

658
00:59:15,916 --> 00:59:19,166
<i>O Radha, your earring
O Radha, the shake of your waist</i>

659
00:59:19,250 --> 00:59:22,875
<i>The whole town is after you</i>

660
00:59:44,750 --> 00:59:48,458
<i>He wears a peacock crown, he steals butter</i>

661
00:59:48,541 --> 00:59:52,291
<i>He plays the flute, he steals the hearts</i>

662
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:57,500
<i>If I look around, I'll find someone else</i>

663
00:59:57,583 --> 01:00:01,125
<i>I'll give him my heart</i>

664
01:00:02,875 --> 01:00:06,541
<i>Radha is naive</i>

665
01:00:06,625 --> 01:00:10,083
<i>This youth won't last long</i>

666
01:00:10,166 --> 01:00:14,000
<i>Please, someone tell Radha</i>

667
01:00:14,083 --> 01:00:17,458
<i>She won't get a beloved</i>

668
01:00:17,541 --> 01:00:21,166
<i>- O Radha, your scarf! O Radha, your ring!
- O Radha, your scarf! O Radha, your ring!</i>

669
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:24,458
<i>-O Radha, your naughty glance
-O Radha, your naughty glance</i>

670
01:00:24,875 --> 01:00:28,416
<i>-O Radha, your earring
-O Radha, the shake of your waist</i>

671
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:32,000
<i>-The whole town is after you
-The whole town is after you</i>

672
01:00:47,208 --> 01:00:50,875
<i>O Radha, why so arrogant?</i>

673
01:00:50,958 --> 01:00:54,250
<i>Don't throw tantrums</i>

674
01:00:54,333 --> 01:00:57,791
<i>Do you think only you're famous here?</i>

675
01:00:57,875 --> 01:01:01,041
<i>There are many crazy for me</i>

676
01:01:01,125 --> 01:01:04,666
<i>The world is mine</i>

677
01:01:04,750 --> 01:01:08,458
<i>Every story starts with me</i>

678
01:01:08,541 --> 01:01:12,208
<i>Let it be crazy, you'll stop teasing</i>

679
01:01:12,291 --> 01:01:15,791
<i>If I strike like lightning</i>

680
01:01:25,833 --> 01:01:31,750
<i>Hey, there! Play the tambourine</i>

681
01:01:33,125 --> 01:01:37,833
<i>I beckon you</i>

682
01:01:39,125 --> 01:01:44,333
<i>Let me dance merrily</i>

683
01:01:50,250 --> 01:01:53,875
<i>O Radha, your scarf
O Radha, your ring</i>

684
01:01:53,958 --> 01:01:57,375
<i>O Radha, your naughty glance</i>

685
01:01:57,458 --> 01:02:01,166
<i>O Radha, your earring
O Radha, the shake of your waist</i>

686
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:05,083
<i>-The whole town is after you
-The whole town is after you</i>

687
01:02:28,041 --> 01:02:29,875
- What are you doing, Shanaya?
- What am I doing?

688
01:02:29,958 --> 01:02:31,708
What do you mean?
You are all over me!

689
01:02:31,791 --> 01:02:33,791
- I was taking your advice.
- My advice?

690
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,083
You said to take the crooked
route to set things straight.

691
01:02:36,166 --> 01:02:38,041
Who else better to carry
out that plan than you?

692
01:02:38,125 --> 01:02:39,583
Shut up! Rohan is my friend.

693
01:02:39,875 --> 01:02:42,291
That's why you won't
take advantage of me.

694
01:02:42,458 --> 01:02:43,750
And my work will get done.

695
01:02:44,208 --> 01:02:46,750
You are being a true friend...

696
01:02:47,083 --> 01:02:48,625
by saving your friend's relationship.

697
01:02:49,250 --> 01:02:51,291
And who knows?
We may become friends along the way.

698
01:02:56,333 --> 01:02:57,750
You are not as stupid as I thought.

699
01:03:00,041 --> 01:03:00,916
What's the plan?

700
01:03:36,875 --> 01:03:37,875
May I sit here?

701
01:03:45,083 --> 01:03:48,166
You are so stressed.
Can I release your tension?

702
01:03:58,708 --> 01:03:59,541
Feels good, right?

703
01:03:59,625 --> 01:04:01,083
Yes, of course!

704
01:04:13,875 --> 01:04:15,625
What are you doing?

705
01:04:15,708 --> 01:04:18,166
Rohan! Come on, make noises.

706
01:04:22,583 --> 01:04:23,916
To hell with the noises!

707
01:04:59,666 --> 01:05:00,750
I think he has left.

708
01:05:03,875 --> 01:05:06,375
You act so well! Come, let's go!

709
01:05:12,666 --> 01:05:16,208
<i>I am fair and young</i>

710
01:05:16,291 --> 01:05:20,125
<i>I am fair and young</i>

711
01:05:20,208 --> 01:05:23,583
<i>I sit in the shade</i>

712
01:05:23,666 --> 01:05:28,291
<i>I sit in the shade</i>

713
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:32,708
<i>I am fair and young</i>

714
01:05:33,083 --> 01:05:36,458
<i>I am fair and young</i>

715
01:05:36,541 --> 01:05:39,541
<i>I sit in the shade</i>

716
01:05:39,666 --> 01:05:42,708
Hey, why are you staring at her like that?

717
01:05:42,791 --> 01:05:44,375
I have been watching you for two days.

718
01:05:44,458 --> 01:05:47,125
- You said Shanaya is not your type?
- Now, she is.

719
01:05:47,208 --> 01:05:48,666
- Stay away from her!
- Why?

720
01:05:48,750 --> 01:05:49,916
She's my girlfriend.

721
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,250
Really? Since when?

722
01:05:52,541 --> 01:05:54,583
You are serious?
That's the problem with you.

723
01:05:54,666 --> 01:05:55,625
You are not serious.

724
01:05:55,708 --> 01:05:57,958
- Do you have time to get serious?
- What do you mean?

725
01:05:58,125 --> 01:05:59,833
When did you last
hold Shanaya's hand?

726
01:05:59,916 --> 01:06:02,250
Hugged her?
Looked into her eyes and spoke?

727
01:06:02,333 --> 01:06:04,083
Who looks into the eyes and speaks?

728
01:06:04,208 --> 01:06:06,583
Listen, just drop this
cool-dude attitude of yours!

729
01:06:06,916 --> 01:06:09,458
You were jealous seeing
me with Shanaya, right?

730
01:06:09,541 --> 01:06:10,375
Yes.

731
01:06:10,458 --> 01:06:12,125
- You died of envy, right?
- I did.

732
01:06:13,083 --> 01:06:15,041
This was our plan to get
you on the right track.

733
01:06:15,541 --> 01:06:17,083
- This was all a plan?
- Yes... a plan.

734
01:06:17,666 --> 01:06:19,333
You won't get another girl like Shanaya.

735
01:06:22,291 --> 01:06:25,666
Look at how she laughs...
she is so dramatic.

736
01:06:26,666 --> 01:06:28,708
Says a fashion designer's
name after every breath.

737
01:06:31,041 --> 01:06:33,250
She is arrogant... has a temper.

738
01:06:34,875 --> 01:06:36,625
But she is justified.

739
01:06:37,416 --> 01:06:40,708
She feels the lack of love.
So, she needs it badly.

740
01:06:42,625 --> 01:06:43,708
She's not that clever...

741
01:06:44,416 --> 01:06:46,041
maybe, that's why she loves you so much.

742
01:06:47,708 --> 01:06:48,625
You are sweet.

743
01:06:49,083 --> 01:06:51,375
To explain all this to me, you
have studied her so well.

744
01:06:51,458 --> 01:06:54,375
- You are right. I'm just a big...
- Yes. A very big one.

745
01:06:54,833 --> 01:06:57,625
Now, if you leave her hand,
I will hold it.

746
01:06:58,291 --> 01:07:01,625
I will kill you!
But before that, I will give you a hug.

747
01:07:03,791 --> 01:07:05,458
You're sure you don't like
Shanaya, right?

748
01:07:05,583 --> 01:07:07,416
No... I like you...

749
01:07:10,583 --> 01:07:15,958
<i>I am fair and young</i>

750
01:07:20,375 --> 01:07:23,291
They say you should hide your
boyfriend's name in the henna design.

751
01:07:23,458 --> 01:07:26,875
If he finds it,
then it's a relationship of a lifetime.

752
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:32,916
- So, should I look for it?
- Yes. Look for it.

753
01:07:39,750 --> 01:07:45,708
<i>I've stepped into your heart</i>

754
01:07:46,708 --> 01:07:52,625
<i>I pray to God</i>

755
01:10:49,583 --> 01:10:51,083
<i>Shanaya wasn't in Abhi's plan.</i>

756
01:10:52,708 --> 01:10:55,958
He was used to winning,
but here he had lost.

757
01:10:58,041 --> 01:10:59,708
It was all because of Shanaya.

758
01:11:00,083 --> 01:11:02,333
She was playing with the emotions
of both the boys.

759
01:11:02,583 --> 01:11:04,375
Everyone's not like you, Tanya.

760
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,791
Shanaya didn't know
about Abhi's feelings.

761
01:11:07,958 --> 01:11:09,166
To hell with these feelings!

762
01:11:09,333 --> 01:11:11,708
It's Abhi's feelings that
ruined it all for everyone.

763
01:11:11,791 --> 01:11:12,833
Everything went awry!

764
01:11:15,416 --> 01:11:17,375
Everything went awry
because of the competition.

765
01:11:17,958 --> 01:11:20,583
Did the competition ruin
everything? Or did we?

766
01:11:46,375 --> 01:11:47,750
Just a second, I'll get a chair.

767
01:11:49,958 --> 01:11:50,875
How are you, Jeet?

768
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:54,000
I'm good.

769
01:11:54,208 --> 01:11:55,250
Come here.

770
01:12:07,416 --> 01:12:09,541
- You look like a girl.
- Effect of motherhood.

771
01:12:09,958 --> 01:12:11,583
You have also become something in life.

772
01:12:11,833 --> 01:12:13,333
Effect of leaving my dad.

773
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,541
Really? What did the doctor say?

774
01:12:32,708 --> 01:12:33,791
Come...

775
01:12:34,166 --> 01:12:35,625
- How are you, brother?
- Great, how are you?

776
01:12:35,708 --> 01:12:37,333
I am also great. Are you married yet?

777
01:12:38,708 --> 01:12:40,875
I hated Rohan because of Shanaya.

778
01:12:43,708 --> 01:12:45,750
And Rohan wasn't a serious boyfriend.

779
01:12:46,541 --> 01:12:48,833
I was looking for someone else
for Shanaya.

780
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,875
And that day, I got the chance.

781
01:13:08,333 --> 01:13:10,041
Look, Shanaya. Your boyfriend is here.

782
01:13:19,791 --> 01:13:22,875
Look... I don't know what
happened over the weekend.

783
01:13:22,958 --> 01:13:24,250
But I was observing Abhi.

784
01:13:29,041 --> 01:13:31,750
It's because of him that
Rohan and I have come closer.

785
01:13:31,958 --> 01:13:33,791
He was staring at you from afar, Shanaya.

786
01:13:33,958 --> 01:13:36,791
And only a one-sided
lover stares like that.

787
01:13:37,250 --> 01:13:41,166
You were also staring at him...
I mean, observing him.

788
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:44,208
Don't try to act smart.
It doesn't suit you.

789
01:13:44,625 --> 01:13:45,958
I just told you what I saw.

790
01:13:59,083 --> 01:14:00,666
I just wanted to thank you again...

791
01:14:05,250 --> 01:14:08,500
Everything is okay, right?
Like... between us.

792
01:14:09,791 --> 01:14:12,791
Everything is not okay.
Like... between us.

793
01:14:14,041 --> 01:14:16,666
Abhi... I love Rohan.

794
01:14:18,083 --> 01:14:19,583
I have heard that, Shanaya.

795
01:14:19,875 --> 01:14:21,500
Are you telling me
or convincing yourself?

796
01:14:23,208 --> 01:14:26,041
Look, I came here to make my future.

797
01:14:26,750 --> 01:14:28,500
To win the "Student of the Year" trophy.

798
01:14:29,541 --> 01:14:34,625
I got distracted for a while,
but now I see my goal clearly.

799
01:14:35,708 --> 01:14:39,166
No one can get in my way now.

800
01:14:54,458 --> 01:14:56,916
This competition is
divided into three parts.

801
01:14:57,375 --> 01:14:59,250
First... the treasure hunt.

802
01:14:59,333 --> 01:15:04,250
Then, the dance competition
and finally the Triathlon.

803
01:15:04,541 --> 01:15:08,333
These three segments will test
your three A's... Academics,

804
01:15:08,416 --> 01:15:10,000
Arts and Athletics.

805
01:15:10,291 --> 01:15:13,541
After every segment, four
contestants will be eliminated.

806
01:15:13,958 --> 01:15:15,958
But before all of this
is the elimination round

807
01:15:16,041 --> 01:15:17,875
which is the IQ test.

808
01:15:27,833 --> 01:15:29,875
Are you studying for the test?

809
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:33,875
You?

810
01:15:34,208 --> 01:15:35,041
Me?

811
01:15:45,625 --> 01:15:49,041
<i>The mind is boggled</i>

812
01:15:49,125 --> 01:15:52,833
<i>Come on, mug it up</i>

813
01:15:52,958 --> 01:15:56,708
<i>Bang your head to get the knowledge</i>

814
01:15:56,791 --> 01:15:59,708
<i>Come on, mug it up</i>

815
01:16:01,250 --> 01:16:04,958
<i>Drink your coffee and beat the temperature</i>

816
01:16:05,041 --> 01:16:08,208
<i>Whet your skills</i>

817
01:16:08,291 --> 01:16:09,375
<i>Come on, mug it up</i>

818
01:16:12,166 --> 01:16:13,375
<i>Come on, mug it up</i>

819
01:16:15,958 --> 01:16:19,708
<i>Come on, mug it up</i>

820
01:16:19,791 --> 01:16:21,291
<i>Come on, mug it up</i>

821
01:16:23,583 --> 01:16:27,375
<i>Climb the mountain of books</i>

822
01:16:27,458 --> 01:16:30,333
<i>Mug up 100 times</i>

823
01:16:30,416 --> 01:16:31,458
<i>Faster!</i>

824
01:16:31,541 --> 01:16:35,125
<i>Let your brain run faster</i>

825
01:16:35,208 --> 01:16:37,958
<i>Come on, mug it up</i>

826
01:16:38,041 --> 01:16:39,500
<i>Faster!</i>

827
01:16:39,583 --> 01:16:43,458
<i>Don't be scared</i>

828
01:16:43,541 --> 01:16:46,375
<i>Just mug it up</i>

829
01:16:46,458 --> 01:16:47,791
<i>Come on, mug it up</i>

830
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:51,708
<i>Come on, mug it up</i>

831
01:16:54,291 --> 01:16:58,000
<i>Come on, mug it up</i>

832
01:16:58,083 --> 01:16:59,291
<i>Come on, mug it up</i>

833
01:17:02,541 --> 01:17:03,750
Everyone is studying.

834
01:17:03,958 --> 01:17:07,041
But I am just going to do one thing. Pray!

835
01:17:08,125 --> 01:17:09,458
Help me, Goddess!

836
01:17:16,625 --> 01:17:17,666
I'll just be back.

837
01:17:19,750 --> 01:17:22,708
<i>It's affectionate love</i>

838
01:17:40,875 --> 01:17:45,916
<i>You're under pressure to perform</i>

839
01:17:46,208 --> 01:17:49,916
<i>It's an ocean which you've to cross</i>

840
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:54,208
<i>Only the strongest will survive</i>

841
01:17:54,333 --> 01:17:58,125
<i>Everyone gets a chance here</i>

842
01:17:58,208 --> 01:18:01,958
<i>Everyone has only one goal</i>

843
01:18:02,041 --> 01:18:05,333
<i>Don't lose the opportunity</i>

844
01:18:05,416 --> 01:18:09,208
<i>It won't knock on your door again</i>

845
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:14,291
<i>Come on, mug it up</i>

846
01:18:20,666 --> 01:18:21,708
<i>Come on, mug it up</i>

847
01:18:22,666 --> 01:18:24,958
Please, show me the answers.

848
01:18:26,916 --> 01:18:28,291
Hail Goddess! A!

849
01:18:29,250 --> 01:18:30,500
Hail Goddess! B!

850
01:18:37,875 --> 01:18:41,333
Gut wrenching day!
The announcement of the Top 16.

851
01:19:19,416 --> 01:19:20,416
Who's first?

852
01:19:35,666 --> 01:19:40,416
Stop... you! What are you doing?
You bulldozer!

853
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:42,333
Enough, enough! He will die.

854
01:19:42,458 --> 01:19:43,541
Okay, I'll spare you.

855
01:19:44,375 --> 01:19:45,208
You, fatso!

856
01:19:46,500 --> 01:19:47,916
Sit. Sit here and tell me...

857
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,041
My bum!

858
01:19:49,125 --> 01:19:51,000
How did you score the first rank?
How did you?

859
01:19:51,083 --> 01:19:52,291
I told you!

860
01:19:52,791 --> 01:19:54,583
I just recited the Goddess's
name and ticked the answers.

861
01:19:54,666 --> 01:19:55,750
All of them turned out right.

862
01:19:55,833 --> 01:19:58,750
Say, Hail Goddess! Say it aloud!

863
01:19:58,833 --> 01:19:59,666
- Hail Goddess!
- Hail Goddess!

864
01:19:59,750 --> 01:20:01,708
Is your Goddess exclusive?

865
01:20:01,791 --> 01:20:04,083
Sudo, you are a minority.
Very few of you are left.

866
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:06,541
Tell me, will Goddess listen to
the majority, or you?

867
01:20:06,625 --> 01:20:08,791
- Now, this new system also among the Gods?
- Yes.

868
01:20:09,333 --> 01:20:10,166
No, dude.

869
01:20:10,250 --> 01:20:11,916
You drama queen, why are you crying?

870
01:20:12,125 --> 01:20:13,666
We are all in the Top 16.

871
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,166
What does it matter who
wins and who loses?

872
01:20:16,875 --> 01:20:19,125
Of course, it matters.
Our ambitions are big.

873
01:20:19,291 --> 01:20:22,500
Your father is.
He can get you into any big university.

874
01:20:22,791 --> 01:20:25,083
Here we go again.
He is after my father.

875
01:20:25,458 --> 01:20:26,291
Hear me out.

876
01:20:26,375 --> 01:20:29,250
Take my father and in exchange,
give me your ambitions.

877
01:20:29,583 --> 01:20:32,791
If you want my ambitions, I will
give them to you happily.

878
01:20:34,083 --> 01:20:36,833
The whole campus knows that
you're generous, Tanya.

879
01:20:37,041 --> 01:20:38,875
But we are digressing from the topic.

880
01:20:39,416 --> 01:20:41,166
We are talking about
the competition and

881
01:20:41,250 --> 01:20:43,833
I think there shouldn't be any
competition among friends.

882
01:20:46,250 --> 01:20:48,000
Is that why you were studying stealthily?

883
01:20:50,958 --> 01:20:52,291
If we all are vying for
the same place, then

884
01:20:52,375 --> 01:20:53,416
there is bound to be competition.

885
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:59,708
Does that mean to win,
you will prey on your best friend?

886
01:21:00,666 --> 01:21:03,833
Yes... maybe.

887
01:21:19,375 --> 01:21:21,291
Next step... the treasure hunt.

888
01:21:23,583 --> 01:21:25,833
The Top 16 will be
divided into four teams.

889
01:21:28,541 --> 01:21:30,375
Every team will get four different

890
01:21:30,458 --> 01:21:31,791
clues one after another.

891
01:21:31,875 --> 01:21:35,625
The last, winning clue will be
the same for all the teams.

892
01:21:36,041 --> 01:21:37,791
The team that reaches
the last clue first...

893
01:21:37,958 --> 01:21:39,041
will win this segment.

894
01:21:42,708 --> 01:21:45,375
<i>The combination for Teams
A and B was weird.</i>

895
01:21:45,458 --> 01:21:47,583
Rohan and Abhi in different teams.
Rohan and Shanaya in different teams.

896
01:21:47,666 --> 01:21:48,916
Rohan and I were also in separate teams.

897
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,541
- Shanaya and I were in different teams.
- I was in Rohan's team.

898
01:22:10,708 --> 01:22:13,583
Here are the first clues
for the four teams.

899
01:22:21,625 --> 01:22:23,916
{\an8}It says, "Blue sky above
and blue sky below.

900
01:22:24,291 --> 01:22:26,666
{\an8}To find the answer,
delve deep, gentlemen."

901
01:22:28,083 --> 01:22:30,041
{\an8}"Ancient smile is Ajit's beloved.

902
01:22:30,125 --> 01:22:32,416
{\an8}She follows you with her glance,
this mysterious lady."

903
01:22:32,500 --> 01:22:34,583
What kind of a clue is this?

904
01:22:34,708 --> 01:22:36,458
Who's Ajit?
Is he from the faculty?

905
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,416
I know only one Ajit.
The one who says, "Mona, darling!

906
01:22:39,500 --> 01:22:40,791
- Where's the gold?"
- "Where's the gold?"

907
01:22:43,708 --> 01:22:46,875
{\an8}Ajit, Mona, smile, ancient...

908
01:22:52,083 --> 01:22:54,458
It's the first clue and our
hopes have been washed away.

909
01:22:55,458 --> 01:22:56,625
Washed away... water.

910
01:23:05,375 --> 01:23:07,041
Will someone tell me what's happening?

911
01:23:07,125 --> 01:23:09,708
{\an8}"Blue sky above and blue sky below.

912
01:23:10,375 --> 01:23:13,708
{\an8}- To find the answer, delve deep...
- Gentlemen."

913
01:23:18,083 --> 01:23:20,083
{\an8}"Angels sing the song of life.

914
01:23:20,166 --> 01:23:22,208
{\an8}Their beloved will come from the skies."

915
01:23:22,333 --> 01:23:23,541
{\an8}"They will unite at 9:30.

916
01:23:23,625 --> 01:23:25,625
{\an8}The answer lies in a ray of sunlight."

917
01:23:32,583 --> 01:23:33,583
Angels!

918
01:23:33,666 --> 01:23:35,833
Angels... where will we get them?

919
01:23:35,916 --> 01:23:36,833
In the canteen!

920
01:23:38,291 --> 01:23:41,750
In the church!
It's just five minutes to 9,30.

921
01:23:43,666 --> 01:23:47,083
{\an8}"I'm a tree and yet I'm not.
If you chat, I hear you.

922
01:23:47,166 --> 01:23:50,541
{\an8}So beautiful am I that your
teacher loves me."

923
01:23:58,291 --> 01:23:59,708
It said tree, so we are in the woods.

924
01:23:59,791 --> 01:24:01,583
But I can't see any teacher here.

925
01:24:01,666 --> 01:24:03,333
What are we looking for?
Teacher or tree?

926
01:24:03,416 --> 01:24:04,583
We are looking for the clue.

927
01:24:05,666 --> 01:24:07,666
If you have a better idea,
tell us, Shanaya.

928
01:24:09,208 --> 01:24:11,208
- Just leave sister-in-law alone.
- She must be your sister-in-law, not mine!

929
01:24:12,416 --> 01:24:13,583
Think... who is the teacher?

930
01:24:14,125 --> 01:24:14,958
The Lord!

931
01:24:15,708 --> 01:24:17,208
There is no temple in the campus.

932
01:24:17,500 --> 01:24:19,875
- I think we should have one.
- Suggest it to Yogi, okay?

933
01:24:19,958 --> 01:24:20,916
Okay, I will.

934
01:24:21,416 --> 01:24:24,666
Yogi... he is our teacher.

935
01:24:24,750 --> 01:24:28,666
{\an8}"Beautiful tree, teacher loves it."

936
01:24:28,750 --> 01:24:30,500
{\an8}He talks to his bonsai every day.

937
01:24:31,583 --> 01:24:33,916
{\an8}Wait a second!
Is his mother's name Bonsai?

938
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:35,708
Shut up! Let's go!

939
01:24:37,583 --> 01:24:39,166
"The answer lies in the
ray of sunlight."

940
01:24:39,250 --> 01:24:40,416
{\an8}Ray of sunlight...

941
01:24:43,083 --> 01:24:44,958
{\an8}RAY OF SUNLIGHT + ANGELS' SONGS
= HYMN BOOK

942
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:49,875
Open it!

943
01:24:51,208 --> 01:24:52,666
{\an8}"Last step... last mystery.

944
01:24:52,750 --> 01:24:54,666
{\an8}How strong is your chemistry?"

945
01:24:55,208 --> 01:24:57,708
{\an8}LAST STEP, LAST MYSTERY.
HOW STRONG IS YOUR CHEMISTRY?

946
01:25:00,041 --> 01:25:02,333
- This is not a tree. It's a shrub!
- Give it to me!

947
01:25:03,333 --> 01:25:05,041
{\an8}"The first voice of Independent India.

948
01:25:05,125 --> 01:25:06,791
{\an8}The answer lies in a silent room."

949
01:25:08,583 --> 01:25:09,875
The silent room is the library.

950
01:25:10,791 --> 01:25:13,500
- Go fast, Sudo!
- That's it.

951
01:25:15,458 --> 01:25:17,291
Sudo... this is blank!

952
01:25:17,375 --> 01:25:19,250
I apologize on behalf
of the treasure hunt.

953
01:25:19,666 --> 01:25:21,791
Guys, think about the clue!

954
01:25:23,583 --> 01:25:25,916
"How strong is our chemistry?"

955
01:25:27,208 --> 01:25:28,416
Hurry up, Jeetu.

956
01:25:28,833 --> 01:25:30,458
I don't want to play this game anymore!

957
01:25:30,583 --> 01:25:33,958
Who's going to answer
in a silent room? Books?

958
01:25:34,041 --> 01:25:36,083
Shut up! What's the first
voice of Independent India?

959
01:25:36,166 --> 01:25:38,791
- "Long Live motherland!"
- It said voice... not a slogan!

960
01:25:39,041 --> 01:25:40,458
I think it must be Mahatma Gandhi.

961
01:25:41,291 --> 01:25:44,208
I think she's right.
He went on a diet for our country.

962
01:25:44,291 --> 01:25:46,583
- Fast!
- I can't say it any faster than this.

963
01:25:46,666 --> 01:25:48,958
Shut up! Not Mahatma Gandhi,
it's Jawaharlal Nehru.

964
01:25:49,166 --> 01:25:51,375
{\an8}India's first speech was
given by Jawaharlal Nehru.

965
01:25:51,458 --> 01:25:53,208
{\an8}Oh, right! That's the first voice.

966
01:25:53,291 --> 01:25:57,083
{\an8}THE FIRST VOICE OF INDEPENDENT INDIA
+ PANDIT NEHRU = TRYST WITH DESTINY

967
01:25:58,833 --> 01:26:00,250
It's written with the invisible ink.

968
01:26:00,333 --> 01:26:01,708
It's visible after using ammonia.

969
01:26:01,791 --> 01:26:02,875
It's visible now.

970
01:26:05,750 --> 01:26:07,166
Just a second. Let me open it.

971
01:26:08,666 --> 01:26:10,083
- Can you see it?
- Hang on a second!

972
01:26:11,291 --> 01:26:13,333
{\an8}"You must be happy that
this is the last step."

973
01:26:13,458 --> 01:26:15,541
{\an8}"The morning bell will help
you surmount this climb."

974
01:26:15,625 --> 01:26:18,000
{\an8}"Read carefully before
giving your suggestion."

975
01:26:18,083 --> 01:26:20,375
{\an8}"Because the above words will
decide who the victor is."

976
01:26:20,458 --> 01:26:22,541
{\an8}I have got a flu with this clue, man.

977
01:26:22,625 --> 01:26:26,208
One moment! Morning bell...

978
01:26:27,083 --> 01:26:29,166
Morning bell... our period bell.

979
01:26:38,500 --> 01:26:39,416
It says bell.

980
01:26:39,833 --> 01:26:41,375
There's the bell!

981
01:26:42,208 --> 01:26:43,125
There's the period bell!

982
01:26:43,208 --> 01:26:45,500
They are already on top.
They will get there before us!

983
01:26:47,458 --> 01:26:48,416
What is he doing?

984
01:26:53,041 --> 01:26:54,750
Sudo! Let's go, man!

985
01:26:58,208 --> 01:27:02,291
God, please bless me.
I'll give up nonvegetarian food.

986
01:27:03,750 --> 01:27:04,625
I love you, Mom.

987
01:27:13,333 --> 01:27:16,375
Hey, you! It's the wrong bell!

988
01:27:16,458 --> 01:27:17,375
Oh, no!

989
01:27:36,958 --> 01:27:38,625
Again the wrong bell!

990
01:27:40,041 --> 01:27:43,000
Rohan... again the wrong bell!

991
01:27:44,125 --> 01:27:46,416
Think, think!
You are the smart one, right?

992
01:27:46,500 --> 01:27:48,083
"You must be happy that
this is the last step."

993
01:27:48,166 --> 01:27:50,833
"Last step... last step."

994
01:27:50,916 --> 01:27:52,750
"You must be happy."

995
01:27:52,833 --> 01:27:54,750
"Last step... last step."

996
01:27:56,375 --> 01:27:57,916
Second step... second step...

997
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:00,416
"You must be happy."

998
01:28:00,625 --> 01:28:04,125
{\an8}You must be happy today.

999
01:28:09,333 --> 01:28:11,625
{\an8}- A big asshole, right?
- A big asshole, right? Run!

1000
01:28:57,291 --> 01:28:59,958
After the treasure hunt,
four students have been eliminated.

1001
01:29:00,541 --> 01:29:02,791
And now, you guys have reached the Top 12.

1002
01:29:03,500 --> 01:29:05,708
The next step is the dance competition.

1003
01:29:06,625 --> 01:29:09,208
Please, remember!
It is important to get a date.

1004
01:29:09,541 --> 01:29:12,708
Meaning a partner.
Or else, you will be eliminated.

1005
01:29:20,750 --> 01:29:23,458
- Come, let's celebrate.
- What? Your defeat?

1006
01:29:23,750 --> 01:29:25,916
No. Your victory.
I'm coming to your house.

1007
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:26,875
Why?

1008
01:29:26,958 --> 01:29:29,291
- For home-cooked food!
- They don't cook at your house?

1009
01:29:29,416 --> 01:29:32,000
Of course, they do.
But I'm tired of room service at home.

1010
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:34,250
Okay, let's go!

1011
01:29:40,083 --> 01:29:42,083
The food is fab, Grandma. Fab!

1012
01:29:42,500 --> 01:29:45,208
Come more often, dear.

1013
01:29:45,583 --> 01:29:47,541
Today, I came without an invitation.

1014
01:29:47,625 --> 01:29:50,041
You do know that your
grandson is abnormal, right?

1015
01:29:50,583 --> 01:29:52,500
Did he fall somewhere when he was young?

1016
01:29:53,416 --> 01:29:54,833
Eat your food, will you?

1017
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,333
Abhi! Is that how you speak to guests?

1018
01:29:57,625 --> 01:30:01,666
Rohan, my son! I can call you that, right?

1019
01:30:03,416 --> 01:30:06,416
Just wanted to say that your photographs
in the newspaper don't do justice.

1020
01:30:06,500 --> 01:30:10,000
You are far more charming
and handsome in real life.

1021
01:30:10,833 --> 01:30:13,625
Keep some butter aside
for the bread, Geeta.

1022
01:30:14,500 --> 01:30:15,916
Butter is expensive, Mom.

1023
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,750
We have to make do
with the words in this house.

1024
01:30:20,708 --> 01:30:24,875
Rohan, we are shareholders
in your Dad's company.

1025
01:30:25,416 --> 01:30:26,708
I'm sorry about that, sir.

1026
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,875
No, no! We have earned quite well.

1027
01:30:30,166 --> 01:30:31,250
Yes!

1028
01:30:31,333 --> 01:30:34,666
Abhi! Do get some tips on
the stocks and let me know.

1029
01:30:34,916 --> 01:30:36,958
We should also benefit
from your friendship, right?

1030
01:30:37,666 --> 01:30:40,208
Don't worry, Uncle.
I will benefit so much from him that...

1031
01:30:40,458 --> 01:30:41,791
I will leave him far behind.

1032
01:30:42,041 --> 01:30:44,041
Yes, of course!
Buy the Taj Mahal as well.

1033
01:30:44,375 --> 01:30:45,958
You don't need money to dream, do you?

1034
01:30:46,833 --> 01:30:48,958
Stupid people like you
and I dream, Auntie.

1035
01:30:49,458 --> 01:30:50,958
Abhi is a blue-chip investment.

1036
01:30:51,500 --> 01:30:53,666
He will not rest until
you are all millionaires.

1037
01:30:55,291 --> 01:30:56,333
Mark my words!

1038
01:31:00,750 --> 01:31:02,083
Pass me the pickle!

1039
01:31:13,166 --> 01:31:14,833
Felt good when you stood
up for me before Auntie.

1040
01:31:16,125 --> 01:31:18,125
Felt like someone my own was talking.

1041
01:31:19,125 --> 01:31:22,291
I never knew Mr. Nanda's
son had this talent.

1042
01:31:22,708 --> 01:31:24,291
A slap and a compliment both together?

1043
01:31:24,458 --> 01:31:26,041
Is that how they say "Thank
you" in your village?

1044
01:31:27,458 --> 01:31:28,833
Okay... here it is.

1045
01:31:32,291 --> 01:31:34,000
Why do you hide your emotions so much?

1046
01:31:34,416 --> 01:31:36,375
Are you a girl?
What kind of questions are these?

1047
01:31:36,750 --> 01:31:37,916
Matters of the heart.

1048
01:31:38,333 --> 01:31:40,958
No one listens at home, so I
thought I would try it on you.

1049
01:31:41,666 --> 01:31:43,000
Here, it's the same situation.

1050
01:31:43,166 --> 01:31:46,083
The ones who listened,
left me and Grandma has a hearing aid.

1051
01:31:46,791 --> 01:31:48,541
So, both of us are in the same situation.

1052
01:31:48,916 --> 01:31:50,916
So, we can talk to each other.

1053
01:31:51,666 --> 01:31:53,291
You... won't kiss me now, right?

1054
01:31:53,958 --> 01:31:56,083
I won't even hug you.

1055
01:31:59,625 --> 01:32:02,583
- What happened?
- Call the ambulance, fast! Grandma is...

1056
01:32:02,666 --> 01:32:03,875
Just call the darn ambulance!

1057
01:32:05,041 --> 01:32:06,083
Her pulse is low.

1058
01:32:10,708 --> 01:32:12,416
- Stop! Where are you going?
- Grandma...

1059
01:32:12,500 --> 01:32:13,875
We will take care of your grandma!

1060
01:32:13,958 --> 01:32:16,375
You will just bring bad
luck wherever you go!

1061
01:32:24,791 --> 01:32:25,750
Leave me!

1062
01:32:27,208 --> 01:32:28,250
This is wrong.

1063
01:32:47,666 --> 01:32:49,541
Are you okay?
Or do you want one more hug?

1064
01:33:13,083 --> 01:33:14,750
I know you are angry with me.

1065
01:33:15,333 --> 01:33:16,708
You just never look at me.

1066
01:33:17,458 --> 01:33:18,875
I don't know what I have done, but...

1067
01:33:18,958 --> 01:33:20,958
Can I please listen
to your sad tale later?

1068
01:33:21,833 --> 01:33:22,833
Grandma is not well.

1069
01:33:24,208 --> 01:33:25,458
That's why I came to meet.

1070
01:33:34,541 --> 01:33:35,958
Yes... why?

1071
01:33:36,500 --> 01:33:38,583
What kind of clothes have you
worn, Shanaya?

1072
01:33:39,125 --> 01:33:42,416
What do I do?
I don't have hospital-type clothes.

1073
01:33:43,708 --> 01:33:46,458
But don't worry.
I'm going shopping today.

1074
01:33:48,416 --> 01:33:50,875
Because I want to come here every day.

1075
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:23,583
<i>The love like a ruby,
The love like a burning sensation</i>

1076
01:34:23,666 --> 01:34:26,625
<i>The love like purity</i>

1077
01:34:27,208 --> 01:34:32,750
<i>It's more than a love</i>

1078
01:34:33,125 --> 01:34:35,708
<i>It's affectionate love</i>

1079
01:34:35,791 --> 01:34:39,958
<i>I'm in love with you</i>

1080
01:34:40,041 --> 01:34:43,041
<i>It's affectionate love</i>

1081
01:34:43,125 --> 01:34:46,833
<i>I don't know how it happened</i>

1082
01:34:46,916 --> 01:34:50,166
<i>It's affectionate love</i>

1083
01:34:50,333 --> 01:34:53,916
<i>She is also in love, but I love her more</i>

1084
01:34:54,125 --> 01:34:56,500
<i>It's affectionate love</i>

1085
01:35:02,458 --> 01:35:05,791
<i>I seemed to come out of my slumber</i>

1086
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:09,208
<i>I've seen the sunshine</i>

1087
01:35:09,583 --> 01:35:13,625
<i>You've brought light in my life</i>

1088
01:35:13,833 --> 01:35:15,416
I want to meet Grandma.

1089
01:35:16,500 --> 01:35:17,791
No.

1090
01:35:17,875 --> 01:35:19,958
Why? I'm looking right, am I not?

1091
01:35:20,625 --> 01:35:23,250
Yes... to go to a temple.

1092
01:35:23,833 --> 01:35:29,625
<i>With all the grace,
The moon is hiding nearby me</i>

1093
01:35:29,708 --> 01:35:32,041
<i>It's affectionate love</i>

1094
01:35:32,875 --> 01:35:36,958
<i>I'm in love with you</i>

1095
01:35:37,041 --> 01:35:39,166
<i>It's affectionate love</i>

1096
01:35:39,708 --> 01:35:43,916
<i>I don't know how it happened</i>

1097
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,791
<i>It's affectionate love</i>

1098
01:35:47,166 --> 01:35:51,125
<i>She is also in love, but I love her more</i>

1099
01:35:51,250 --> 01:35:53,458
<i>It's affectionate love</i>

1100
01:36:28,166 --> 01:36:30,458
<i>Just imagine this...</i>

1101
01:36:30,666 --> 01:36:34,208
<i>You are with me
And we get lost</i>

1102
01:36:34,291 --> 01:36:37,833
<i>Together</i>

1103
01:36:38,708 --> 01:36:41,291
<i>It happens and...</i>

1104
01:36:41,375 --> 01:36:47,333
<i>My heart is at peace</i>

1105
01:36:49,666 --> 01:36:53,333
<i>When I see a shooting star</i>

1106
01:36:53,416 --> 01:36:56,708
<i>I just ask for your heart</i>

1107
01:36:57,125 --> 01:37:02,125
<i>The heart yearns for more</i>

1108
01:37:02,208 --> 01:37:05,000
<i>It's affectionate love</i>

1109
01:37:05,083 --> 01:37:09,416
<i>This heart acts more naive today</i>

1110
01:37:09,500 --> 01:37:12,291
<i>It's affectionate love</i>

1111
01:37:12,375 --> 01:37:16,416
<i>The fear of losing you is more</i>

1112
01:37:16,500 --> 01:37:19,208
<i>It's affectionate love</i>

1113
01:37:19,375 --> 01:37:23,625
<i>I'm in love with you</i>

1114
01:37:23,708 --> 01:37:24,916
<i>It's affectionate love</i>

1115
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:28,458
<i>The love like a ruby,
The love like a burning sensation</i>

1116
01:37:28,583 --> 01:37:30,625
<i>The love like purity</i>

1117
01:37:30,708 --> 01:37:32,166
<i>It's affectionate love</i>

1118
01:37:32,250 --> 01:37:37,416
<i>It's more than a love</i>

1119
01:37:37,500 --> 01:37:39,041
<i>It's affectionate love</i>

1120
01:37:39,125 --> 01:37:42,750
<i>The love like a ruby,
The love like a burning sensation</i>

1121
01:37:42,833 --> 01:37:46,291
<i>The love like purity</i>

1122
01:37:46,375 --> 01:37:52,000
<i>It's more than a love</i>

1123
01:37:52,083 --> 01:37:54,375
<i>It's affectionate love</i>

1124
01:38:03,750 --> 01:38:05,291
Doctors are saying it's serious.

1125
01:38:08,125 --> 01:38:11,083
If something happens to you,
I will never speak to you.

1126
01:38:15,250 --> 01:38:16,916
Never speak with your back to a person.

1127
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:19,916
Bad manners, right?

1128
01:38:28,375 --> 01:38:31,791
There's something... urgent.

1129
01:38:34,416 --> 01:38:35,500
Tell me.

1130
01:38:36,333 --> 01:38:37,708
After I go...

1131
01:38:39,250 --> 01:38:43,666
please, put my nice picture
in the drawing room.

1132
01:38:45,041 --> 01:38:46,041
A smiling one.

1133
01:38:59,458 --> 01:39:00,416
Please, don't go.

1134
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,541
<i>Abhi was broken after Grandma's death.</i>

1135
01:39:30,291 --> 01:39:31,458
<i>He became quiet.</i>

1136
01:39:33,500 --> 01:39:34,958
<i>He wasn't saying anything to anyone.</i>

1137
01:39:40,083 --> 01:39:41,208
Rohan's room is ahead.

1138
01:39:42,750 --> 01:39:44,250
I've come to meet you.

1139
01:39:46,291 --> 01:39:47,500
To condole me?

1140
01:39:50,250 --> 01:39:52,875
Rohan was saying you don't
want to meet anyone.

1141
01:39:53,500 --> 01:39:54,458
You can't be alone...

1142
01:39:54,541 --> 01:39:55,875
I must get used to being alone.

1143
01:39:58,500 --> 01:39:59,958
Everyone who was close has left.

1144
01:40:01,458 --> 01:40:03,916
You should stay away as well.
Or you will die!

1145
01:40:05,333 --> 01:40:07,666
- You need a friend...
- We can't be friends, Shanaya!

1146
01:40:07,875 --> 01:40:09,083
Do you want to be my friend?

1147
01:40:25,875 --> 01:40:26,791
What are you doing?

1148
01:40:26,916 --> 01:40:29,708
Shanaya, Just go.
I don't want to meet anyone.

1149
01:40:29,791 --> 01:40:32,250
Go! I said, go!

1150
01:40:32,958 --> 01:40:36,208
But, Abhi... this won't suit you.

1151
01:42:12,791 --> 01:42:13,750
What are you doing...

1152
01:42:13,833 --> 01:42:17,166
Shut your mouth!
You showed your true class.

1153
01:42:17,333 --> 01:42:19,041
Came down to your true cheap self!

1154
01:42:19,291 --> 01:42:21,458
I should have never entertained
small people like you!

1155
01:42:21,541 --> 01:42:24,041
I was your best friend...
and what did you do?

1156
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:26,250
You can never be close to anyone.

1157
01:42:26,333 --> 01:42:28,666
Never! That's why there's no one for you.

1158
01:42:28,875 --> 01:42:32,791
Everyone's dead.
Mom... Dad... Grandma... everyone!

1159
01:42:39,166 --> 01:42:42,458
If you say one more word about my mom
or dad, I will break your face!

1160
01:42:43,125 --> 01:42:45,375
Forget me, you couldn't be
close to your mom or dad.

1161
01:42:45,458 --> 01:42:47,541
You talk about class...
status. What about you?

1162
01:42:47,916 --> 01:42:49,833
You just waste your
father's money and time.

1163
01:42:49,916 --> 01:42:51,375
Father's money... father's money...

1164
01:42:51,458 --> 01:42:53,166
You were always after
my father's success.

1165
01:42:53,250 --> 01:42:54,791
That's why you became
friends with me, right?

1166
01:42:54,875 --> 01:42:56,250
You wanted to live my life.

1167
01:42:56,333 --> 01:42:58,000
That's why you wanted
to snatch my girlfriend...

1168
01:42:58,083 --> 01:42:59,625
Stop this nonsense
of girlfriend-boyfriend!

1169
01:42:59,708 --> 01:43:01,125
Shanaya has never loved you and you?

1170
01:43:01,208 --> 01:43:02,916
You pounce on every second girl.

1171
01:43:03,083 --> 01:43:04,666
You have no right to call
her your girlfriend.

1172
01:43:04,750 --> 01:43:07,416
Don't teach me my rights!
Shanaya is mine and only mine!

1173
01:43:07,500 --> 01:43:09,666
Ask her whom she belongs to.
Shanaya loves me.

1174
01:43:19,166 --> 01:43:20,875
What do you two know about me?

1175
01:43:21,083 --> 01:43:22,166
About my feelings?

1176
01:43:22,791 --> 01:43:23,666
Nothing!

1177
01:43:25,791 --> 01:43:27,500
Neither of you wants to know.

1178
01:43:28,166 --> 01:43:29,666
You just want to own me.

1179
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,375
I'm not a part of the competition that...

1180
01:43:33,875 --> 01:43:35,666
you guys will fight and win.

1181
01:43:52,291 --> 01:43:53,208
- What happened, Rohan...
- Nothing.

1182
01:43:53,291 --> 01:43:55,291
- You are bleeding. You say it's nothing?
- It's nothing, Mom!

1183
01:43:55,375 --> 01:43:56,500
Nothing happened, Mom!

1184
01:43:59,791 --> 01:44:00,708
Dad, it's nothing.

1185
01:44:03,833 --> 01:44:06,708
Look at yourself!
You look like a street ruffian.

1186
01:44:07,250 --> 01:44:08,625
Whom did you fight with?
Answer me!

1187
01:44:08,708 --> 01:44:10,416
I told you I don't want to answer...

1188
01:44:10,500 --> 01:44:12,666
You must answer! It's my house.

1189
01:44:13,916 --> 01:44:15,458
I have had it with your insolence.

1190
01:44:15,916 --> 01:44:18,541
You don't speak properly at home.
At least, keep my prestige intact outside.

1191
01:44:18,625 --> 01:44:20,083
You haven't earned prestige, Dad.

1192
01:44:20,166 --> 01:44:21,375
You've only earned money.

1193
01:44:21,500 --> 01:44:23,750
The same money that supports
your lifestyle, get it?

1194
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,958
You only know how to waste
that money and embarrass me!

1195
01:44:27,250 --> 01:44:29,583
What are you ashamed of, Dad?

1196
01:44:29,791 --> 01:44:30,916
That I'm not like you?

1197
01:44:31,125 --> 01:44:33,375
That I'm not your photocopy
like your elder son?

1198
01:44:33,541 --> 01:44:35,583
That I don't want to be
an industrialist but a musician?

1199
01:44:35,666 --> 01:44:36,916
Yes, I'm ashamed!

1200
01:44:37,166 --> 01:44:40,375
I'm ashamed that my son has
such middle-class dreams.

1201
01:44:40,458 --> 01:44:43,458
Dreams don't have a class, Dad.

1202
01:44:43,833 --> 01:44:47,250
But only a father would understand
this, not a corrupt man!

1203
01:44:53,291 --> 01:44:54,958
I don't want to live in your house.

1204
01:44:55,291 --> 01:44:57,083
And I don't want to be your son.

1205
01:44:57,208 --> 01:44:59,250
You have lost that right.

1206
01:45:00,083 --> 01:45:01,458
I was never your son, right?

1207
01:45:07,125 --> 01:45:08,000
No, Mom.

1208
01:45:08,583 --> 01:45:11,166
Not today! You've kept
quiet for so many years.

1209
01:45:11,250 --> 01:45:12,666
Don't say anything today as well!

1210
01:45:19,791 --> 01:45:21,583
<i>I thought it was a family fight
that would be solved.</i>

1211
01:45:22,166 --> 01:45:24,375
But the spoiled rich brat had reformed.

1212
01:45:24,791 --> 01:45:27,083
And he had decided never to look back.

1213
01:45:47,416 --> 01:45:49,291
I made the mistake
of being your good friend.

1214
01:45:50,291 --> 01:45:52,541
Now, I won't lose the chance
of being your worst enemy.

1215
01:45:53,500 --> 01:45:55,625
I will win
the "Student of the Year" trophy.

1216
01:45:57,125 --> 01:45:59,291
I will snatch your fate from you.

1217
01:46:01,625 --> 01:46:02,833
Watch it!

1218
01:46:11,625 --> 01:46:13,250
<i>The war had begun.</i>

1219
01:46:13,458 --> 01:46:14,833
Now, it wasn't enough to win.

1220
01:46:15,333 --> 01:46:16,708
It was important to defeat others.

1221
01:46:17,166 --> 01:46:19,000
Friendships, relationships...
all of it was immaterial.

1222
01:46:19,083 --> 01:46:21,083
We all had our eyes on one goal.

1223
01:46:27,875 --> 01:46:31,666
<i>Come on, mug it up</i>

1224
01:46:34,125 --> 01:46:36,000
Aren't you planning to move ahead?

1225
01:46:36,458 --> 01:46:38,791
Today upper body...
just upper body!

1226
01:46:45,125 --> 01:46:48,166
<i>Come on, mug it up</i>

1227
01:46:54,625 --> 01:46:56,291
<i>Come on, mug it up</i>

1228
01:47:06,625 --> 01:47:08,916
Whom are you going to the prom with?
Abhi or Rohan?

1229
01:47:12,125 --> 01:47:14,125
The whole school is gossiping about me.

1230
01:47:14,416 --> 01:47:16,458
Forget the school.
Talk about your feelings...

1231
01:47:16,541 --> 01:47:17,916
I hate them both.

1232
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:19,250
You love Abhimanyu.

1233
01:47:20,083 --> 01:47:22,583
- Rohan and I have been...
- What about Rohan and you?

1234
01:47:23,166 --> 01:47:24,333
It's nothing, Shanaya.

1235
01:47:24,833 --> 01:47:27,166
Your pair was not destined.
It was an arrangement.

1236
01:47:28,250 --> 01:47:29,750
You are confused.

1237
01:47:31,541 --> 01:47:32,583
Take some time.

1238
01:47:32,875 --> 01:47:34,583
Your heart will give you the right answer.

1239
01:47:35,958 --> 01:47:37,833
This competition in
the middle of all this...

1240
01:47:40,166 --> 01:47:41,250
Give it up.

1241
01:47:44,125 --> 01:47:47,500
Is this competition more
important than your feelings?

1242
01:47:47,833 --> 01:47:48,875
No, right?

1243
01:47:51,250 --> 01:47:52,333
No.

1244
01:47:56,041 --> 01:47:58,458
I'm not going to be
a part of this dance competition.

1245
01:47:58,958 --> 01:48:00,791
That means, I will be disqualified...

1246
01:48:03,541 --> 01:48:04,583
What do you think?

1247
01:48:07,416 --> 01:48:09,250
If I was in your place,
I would do the same.

1248
01:48:22,916 --> 01:48:25,041
I was thinking about you.

1249
01:48:26,166 --> 01:48:29,833
You are dumb,
but you have a good heart.

1250
01:48:30,541 --> 01:48:32,500
That's why I have decided
that this year...

1251
01:48:32,583 --> 01:48:34,625
on the prom night, I'm your date.

1252
01:48:34,708 --> 01:48:36,291
You are not a date. You are late.

1253
01:48:36,541 --> 01:48:38,083
Shanaya has already asked me.

1254
01:48:38,375 --> 01:48:39,833
And she is going to enter with me.

1255
01:48:42,916 --> 01:48:44,875
Yes. She is hot and you are not.

1256
01:48:51,250 --> 01:48:52,875
You are going to the prom with Jeet?

1257
01:48:54,791 --> 01:48:59,000
Yes... I suddenly thought...

1258
01:48:59,416 --> 01:49:02,083
why should I let Rohan
and Abhi control my life?

1259
01:49:02,250 --> 01:49:04,166
And why did you think that
suddenly, Shanaya?

1260
01:49:05,083 --> 01:49:06,500
You should be happy.

1261
01:49:07,541 --> 01:49:09,166
I don't understand this reaction.

1262
01:49:12,875 --> 01:49:15,541
You wanted me to back
out of this competition.

1263
01:49:15,625 --> 01:49:17,166
You wanted me to be disqualified.

1264
01:49:17,458 --> 01:49:19,500
So that the chances
of your winning go up.

1265
01:49:19,833 --> 01:49:20,875
Come on! Let's face it.

1266
01:49:21,333 --> 01:49:24,375
You dancing is like me being poor.

1267
01:49:30,041 --> 01:49:32,708
If I was in your place,
I would do the same!

1268
01:49:48,500 --> 01:49:50,708
No. I have just fought with Shanaya.

1269
01:49:52,583 --> 01:49:53,500
I'm fed up.

1270
01:49:54,041 --> 01:49:54,875
Why? What happened?

1271
01:49:54,958 --> 01:49:57,416
She says she's confused
between Rohan and you.

1272
01:49:58,125 --> 01:50:00,958
But she's going to prom with Jeet,
so that Rohan gets jealous.

1273
01:50:01,500 --> 01:50:03,166
Then, what's the confusion?

1274
01:50:07,500 --> 01:50:10,000
I don't want to get
caught up in all this.

1275
01:50:16,791 --> 01:50:17,625
Yes?

1276
01:50:17,958 --> 01:50:19,208
Whom are you going to prom with?

1277
01:50:26,958 --> 01:50:30,375
Jeet, no one's going to the prom with me.
Help me, please.

1278
01:50:32,375 --> 01:50:33,250
Look, Sudo.

1279
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:36,708
But I can't go to the prom with you.

1280
01:50:37,375 --> 01:50:40,083
Not you...
but set me up with someone.

1281
01:50:40,166 --> 01:50:42,625
You think I run an agency?
Just go. Let me sleep.

1282
01:50:42,708 --> 01:50:43,791
Ge up, Sudo!

1283
01:50:46,083 --> 01:50:48,041
- Just get up! Up!
- What is it?

1284
01:50:48,250 --> 01:50:49,791
You will go with Shanaya to the prom?

1285
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:51,541
- Who the hell do you think you are?
- Jeet.

1286
01:50:51,625 --> 01:50:53,833
I know your name, idiot!

1287
01:50:54,125 --> 01:50:55,750
Have you been bitten by a crazy dog?

1288
01:50:55,833 --> 01:50:58,041
Yes, when I was a kid.
But what has that got to do with anything?

1289
01:50:58,750 --> 01:51:01,416
Just go and tell Shanaya you
can't go to the prom with her.

1290
01:51:01,500 --> 01:51:02,541
- Come on, go...
- Hey!

1291
01:51:02,916 --> 01:51:04,250
I'm not your slave, okay?

1292
01:51:04,625 --> 01:51:07,208
And I don't need your
permission to lead my life.

1293
01:51:08,166 --> 01:51:11,208
You, wastrel! You have been living
on my credit card for the last two years.

1294
01:51:11,291 --> 01:51:12,666
And now you're trying to act smart?

1295
01:51:12,750 --> 01:51:14,791
So, I have given full services
for the credit card.

1296
01:51:14,875 --> 01:51:16,750
"Jeet, get a drink.
Jeet, park the car.

1297
01:51:16,833 --> 01:51:18,916
Take Shanaya here.
Take Shanaya there."

1298
01:51:19,125 --> 01:51:20,666
Now, I'm taking Shanaya to the prom.

1299
01:51:25,791 --> 01:51:26,875
Showed me your true class.

1300
01:51:26,958 --> 01:51:30,041
Just go.
What class are you talking about?

1301
01:51:31,666 --> 01:51:32,750
You have left your dad now.

1302
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:34,708
The credit card is of no use to anyone.

1303
01:51:35,750 --> 01:51:38,541
- Get away!
- I'm not scared of you!

1304
01:51:38,916 --> 01:51:40,208
I'm now on my own.

1305
01:51:40,583 --> 01:51:42,875
I'm not your bodyguard!
You'll see...

1306
01:51:43,291 --> 01:51:45,333
how I win
the "Student of the Year" trophy!

1307
01:51:45,833 --> 01:51:46,875
You will win the trophy?

1308
01:51:49,083 --> 01:51:50,083
I'd like to see that!

1309
01:51:58,916 --> 01:52:00,166
If you want...

1310
01:52:00,833 --> 01:52:04,583
I will go to the prom with you.

1311
01:52:12,166 --> 01:52:13,916
No one wanted to go to the prom with me.

1312
01:52:14,333 --> 01:52:16,541
And finally my hand was held...

1313
01:53:10,583 --> 01:53:14,291
<i>I'll forget the entire world</i>

1314
01:53:14,375 --> 01:53:16,875
<i>I'll dance with you</i>

1315
01:53:22,458 --> 01:53:25,083
<i>I'll dance with you</i>

1316
01:53:27,333 --> 01:53:29,333
<i>Come and talk to me</i>

1317
01:53:29,625 --> 01:53:33,458
<i>Let's create a saga</i>

1318
01:53:39,291 --> 01:53:41,750
<i>We're crazy about disco</i>

1319
01:53:47,041 --> 01:53:49,916
<i>We're crazy about disco</i>

1320
01:53:54,541 --> 01:53:56,208
<i>The night is intoxicating</i>

1321
01:53:56,291 --> 01:53:58,208
<i>Give me your hand</i>

1322
01:53:58,291 --> 01:54:02,291
<i>Let's sing and dance</i>

1323
01:54:02,375 --> 01:54:04,791
<i>We're crazy about disco</i>

1324
01:54:40,708 --> 01:54:44,000
<i>I have my eyes on you</i>

1325
01:54:44,125 --> 01:54:47,791
<i>Let our eyes do the talking</i>

1326
01:54:48,416 --> 01:54:51,791
<i>Come and embrace me</i>

1327
01:54:52,250 --> 01:54:55,500
<i>That's how the nights begin</i>

1328
01:54:55,583 --> 01:54:59,166
<i>These talks happen in moments like these</i>

1329
01:54:59,250 --> 01:55:03,708
<i>And that's how you get
To meet the entire world</i>

1330
01:55:03,791 --> 01:55:05,541
<i>We're crazy about disco</i>

1331
01:55:09,583 --> 01:55:12,541
<i>We're crazy about disco</i>

1332
01:55:17,250 --> 01:55:20,500
<i>We're crazy about disco</i>

1333
01:55:24,541 --> 01:55:26,541
<i>The night is intoxicating</i>

1334
01:55:26,625 --> 01:55:28,625
<i>Give me your hand</i>

1335
01:55:28,708 --> 01:55:32,416
<i>Let's sing and dance</i>

1336
01:55:32,500 --> 01:55:35,583
<i>We're crazy about disco</i>

1337
01:55:58,875 --> 01:56:02,333
<i>This is a game of night
Play it for a while</i>

1338
01:56:02,750 --> 01:56:06,541
<i>Dance while embracing me</i>

1339
01:56:06,625 --> 01:56:10,333
<i>With just my gaze,
I'll make you understand</i>

1340
01:56:10,416 --> 01:56:14,250
<i>The night still remains
Make me lose my senses</i>

1341
01:56:14,375 --> 01:56:15,916
<i>Dance like there's no tomorrow</i>

1342
01:56:16,125 --> 01:56:17,916
<i>Move like you are intoxicated</i>

1343
01:56:18,125 --> 01:56:19,791
<i>Party like crazy</i>

1344
01:56:19,875 --> 01:56:22,000
<i>Say what you want</i>

1345
01:56:25,875 --> 01:56:30,250
<i>It's easy to make excuses</i>

1346
01:56:35,875 --> 01:56:38,833
<i>We're crazy about disco</i>

1347
01:56:43,708 --> 01:56:46,458
<i>We're crazy about disco</i>

1348
01:56:50,958 --> 01:56:52,708
<i>The night is intoxicating</i>

1349
01:56:52,791 --> 01:56:55,000
<i>Give me your hand</i>

1350
01:56:55,083 --> 01:56:59,125
<i>Let's sing and dance</i>

1351
01:57:06,875 --> 01:57:10,375
<i>It's affectionate love</i>

1352
01:57:14,416 --> 01:57:18,125
<i>It's affectionate love</i>

1353
01:57:22,041 --> 01:57:23,833
<i>It's affectionate love</i>

1354
01:57:23,916 --> 01:57:27,541
<i>The love like a ruby,
The love like a burning sensation</i>

1355
01:57:27,708 --> 01:57:30,000
<i>The love like purity</i>

1356
01:57:30,083 --> 01:57:31,625
<i>It's affectionate love</i>

1357
01:57:31,708 --> 01:57:37,541
<i>It's more than a love</i>

1358
01:58:12,916 --> 01:58:14,208
After the dance competition,

1359
01:58:14,291 --> 01:58:16,958
four students out of the 12
have been eliminated.

1360
01:58:36,500 --> 01:58:39,750
Now, these eight finalists
will fight in the triathlon.

1361
01:58:57,125 --> 01:58:58,291
Hi, Abhi. How are you?

1362
01:59:00,291 --> 01:59:02,083
Abhi and Rohan both
are in the top eight.

1363
01:59:02,375 --> 01:59:03,666
The competition is tough.

1364
01:59:06,458 --> 01:59:08,458
You will say that.
Rohan is your son, after all.

1365
01:59:08,875 --> 01:59:12,250
That's why...
I say the victory is Abhi's.

1366
01:59:24,083 --> 01:59:27,875
<i>Get 100% ready</i>

1367
01:59:27,958 --> 01:59:29,750
<i>Go and win it</i>

1368
01:59:29,833 --> 01:59:31,625
<i>You can do this</i>

1369
01:59:31,708 --> 01:59:33,541
<i>There's only one solution</i>

1370
01:59:33,625 --> 01:59:35,500
<i>To your problem</i>

1371
01:59:35,583 --> 01:59:40,208
<i>Come on, push</i>

1372
01:59:43,083 --> 01:59:48,583
<i>Come on, push</i>

1373
01:59:48,750 --> 01:59:50,291
<i>Come on, push</i>

1374
01:59:52,625 --> 01:59:58,250
<i>Come on, push</i>

1375
01:59:58,333 --> 01:59:59,666
<i>Come on, push</i>

1376
02:00:00,583 --> 02:00:02,416
<i>Harder!</i>

1377
02:00:04,250 --> 02:00:05,333
<i>Harder!</i>

1378
02:00:05,416 --> 02:00:06,583
Oh, no!

1379
02:00:07,958 --> 02:00:12,083
<i>Come on, push</i>

1380
02:00:13,875 --> 02:00:14,916
<i>Come on, push</i>

1381
02:00:17,625 --> 02:00:18,916
<i>Come on, push</i>

1382
02:00:24,500 --> 02:00:29,125
We are on the last leg of the competition.

1383
02:00:30,958 --> 02:00:34,166
This is a unique combination
of swimming, cycling and running.

1384
02:00:34,666 --> 02:00:38,125
The last eight finalists
will participate in it.

1385
02:08:16,916 --> 02:08:20,333
Every student of St. T's dreams of winning
the "Student of the Year" trophy.

1386
02:08:22,708 --> 02:08:25,083
There have been many exemplary students...

1387
02:08:25,291 --> 02:08:26,958
who have won this in 25 years.

1388
02:08:28,541 --> 02:08:32,666
I don't mean to insult anyone,
but I can't accept this trophy.

1389
02:08:36,583 --> 02:08:37,750
I have my own reasons.

1390
02:09:15,666 --> 02:09:17,791
When you should clap,
why aren't you guys clapping?

1391
02:09:26,916 --> 02:09:29,541
This kind of unruly behavior...

1392
02:09:29,666 --> 02:09:31,125
won't be tolerated in this school.

1393
02:09:38,583 --> 02:09:39,541
Get him out of here!

1394
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:47,958
This "Student of the Year"
is your idea, right?

1395
02:09:48,291 --> 02:09:49,625
Then, you should get the award.

1396
02:09:50,625 --> 02:09:53,625
Take the award...
for the most stupid idea.

1397
02:09:54,333 --> 02:09:56,166
Why? Because you didn't win?

1398
02:09:56,500 --> 02:09:57,708
Just look at yourself!

1399
02:09:59,041 --> 02:10:03,375
Yes... I lost. But why did I lose?

1400
02:10:03,833 --> 02:10:07,208
Because of you.
Because of your dumb rules.

1401
02:10:07,458 --> 02:10:09,375
Make the girls and the boys race together.

1402
02:10:09,791 --> 02:10:11,666
Get a partner to the prom.

1403
02:10:12,250 --> 02:10:16,875
Dance and win a trophy.

1404
02:10:20,166 --> 02:10:23,166
But who cares about us who can't dance!

1405
02:10:24,625 --> 02:10:28,375
Who cares that people like us
don't get partners, Dean?

1406
02:10:38,708 --> 02:10:39,958
Just let me speak!

1407
02:10:40,333 --> 02:10:42,125
This charade has been
going on for 25 years.

1408
02:10:42,291 --> 02:10:44,666
And why? Because Dean Yoginder Vasisht

1409
02:10:44,750 --> 02:10:46,416
has no entertainment in his life.

1410
02:10:46,875 --> 02:10:50,625
He is alone and so, he wants
to break our friendships.

1411
02:11:01,125 --> 02:11:03,666
Your final episode is a hit!

1412
02:11:04,083 --> 02:11:07,333
The friendships that were built over two
years have been finished in two weeks!

1413
02:11:07,458 --> 02:11:09,375
We hate each other!

1414
02:12:55,875 --> 02:12:57,791
I thought you would call
me, when you had a baby.

1415
02:12:58,625 --> 02:12:59,833
So much ego?

1416
02:13:00,041 --> 02:13:01,875
Not ego... shame.

1417
02:13:05,166 --> 02:13:06,541
What was the use of all that?

1418
02:13:08,833 --> 02:13:11,083
Forget all that and show
me the baby's picture.

1419
02:13:18,583 --> 02:13:19,708
What's her name?

1420
02:13:22,250 --> 02:13:23,708
I can't afford that name.

1421
02:13:25,666 --> 02:13:27,166
You haven't changed, have you?

1422
02:13:28,166 --> 02:13:29,416
Listen...

1423
02:13:29,666 --> 02:13:30,791
how's Tanya doing?

1424
02:13:31,416 --> 02:13:32,833
She's hunting for a new husband.

1425
02:13:32,916 --> 02:13:34,291
Keep Abhi away from her.

1426
02:13:35,208 --> 02:13:37,250
I have to keep Abhi
away from someone else.

1427
02:13:38,250 --> 02:13:39,125
Right!

1428
02:13:39,416 --> 02:13:41,458
It's a hospital.
Can't have them trashing it.

1429
02:13:42,916 --> 02:13:43,916
I'll just be back.

1430
02:14:02,166 --> 02:14:04,541
You didn't invite me for the wedding.

1431
02:14:04,750 --> 02:14:07,333
I would have come...
from the bride's side. It's my right.

1432
02:14:09,166 --> 02:14:10,458
Why this intense look?

1433
02:14:10,875 --> 02:14:12,916
There must always be pain
on a musician's face.

1434
02:14:13,291 --> 02:14:14,666
Or else CDs don't sell.

1435
02:14:15,416 --> 02:14:16,750
I have listened to your songs.

1436
02:14:19,666 --> 02:14:20,708
Abhi lets you do that?

1437
02:14:21,958 --> 02:14:23,166
I listen to them stealthily.

1438
02:14:24,375 --> 02:14:25,791
Okay, come and meet Abhi.

1439
02:14:26,750 --> 02:14:29,416
You married him and still
exercising your right on me?

1440
02:14:39,125 --> 02:14:43,125
It has been ten years.
Can't you just say a hello?

1441
02:14:43,583 --> 02:14:46,291
He sings loudly on stage.
He can also say hello!

1442
02:14:46,750 --> 02:14:49,625
You are an investment banker,
not a nine-year-old.

1443
02:14:49,708 --> 02:14:50,875
And you are my wife...

1444
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:52,375
not your ex boyfriend's lawyer.

1445
02:14:55,083 --> 02:14:57,791
I saw you hugging him.
Feeling the love for him, are you?

1446
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:01,208
What else did you expect?

1447
02:15:01,791 --> 02:15:03,458
His bank account may
have crores, but class...

1448
02:15:03,583 --> 02:15:04,958
is still not affordable for him.

1449
02:15:05,041 --> 02:15:06,750
What did you achieve with your high class?

1450
02:15:06,833 --> 02:15:08,416
You just strum strings on stage.

1451
02:15:08,916 --> 02:15:10,250
But I hug nicely.

1452
02:15:11,916 --> 02:15:13,625
Bastard, mind your tongue!
She is my wife.

1453
02:15:13,708 --> 02:15:16,166
When you kissed her that
day, she was my girlfriend.

1454
02:15:25,666 --> 02:15:26,833
Stop them!

1455
02:15:26,916 --> 02:15:29,666
Wait a minute! These are
the pent-up feelings of ten years.

1456
02:15:29,750 --> 02:15:30,708
Don't stop them.

1457
02:15:35,166 --> 02:15:37,458
Why such rage? Why so much anger?

1458
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:39,791
Can't be because of Shanaya.

1459
02:15:39,875 --> 02:15:42,541
You never loved her.
Then, why this anger? Why?

1460
02:15:44,833 --> 02:15:47,500
You lost on purpose that day.
On purpose!

1461
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:01,500
This question has been
bugging me for ten years.

1462
02:16:02,083 --> 02:16:03,833
Why did you do it? Tell me, why?

1463
02:16:03,916 --> 02:16:05,916
Because your father was a rogue!

1464
02:16:12,750 --> 02:16:15,041
He looked happy, when he saw you losing.

1465
02:16:16,083 --> 02:16:19,541
I wanted to be like him,
but I'm not that bad.

1466
02:16:25,625 --> 02:16:27,375
In that moment, I realized I could defeat

1467
02:16:27,458 --> 02:16:29,375
India's most influential man
by making you win.

1468
02:16:29,875 --> 02:16:30,708
So, I did it.

1469
02:16:40,625 --> 02:16:41,916
My dad had died, Rohan...

1470
02:16:42,291 --> 02:16:43,666
but yours wasn't alive either.

1471
02:16:44,208 --> 02:16:47,125
I destroyed my father when I left home.

1472
02:16:47,625 --> 02:16:49,541
I didn't need your greatness.

1473
02:16:49,625 --> 02:16:52,125
Greatness? And what about
your greatness on stage?

1474
02:16:52,208 --> 02:16:54,083
You made a great sacrifice
and you left, right?

1475
02:16:54,458 --> 02:16:56,583
If you knew all this,
why didn't you say it that day?

1476
02:16:56,666 --> 02:16:58,708
Because you wanted to show
your father that you won.

1477
02:17:07,833 --> 02:17:09,083
Whom did you call a loser?

1478
02:17:09,833 --> 02:17:11,500
My last five albums have
been platinum hits.

1479
02:17:11,583 --> 02:17:13,625
So? My company's turnover is 500 crores!

1480
02:17:13,708 --> 02:17:16,083
Top international music
labels run after me!

1481
02:17:16,166 --> 02:17:18,166
Top multinationals beg me for mergers.

1482
02:17:18,250 --> 02:17:20,208
When I perform, the whole
of Wembley trembles.

1483
02:17:20,291 --> 02:17:22,083
When I perform, the whole
stock market shakes.

1484
02:17:22,166 --> 02:17:23,791
- I have done 100 girls...
- And I have...

1485
02:17:26,416 --> 02:17:27,250
100?

1486
02:17:28,291 --> 02:17:29,583
Almost 100.

1487
02:17:31,333 --> 02:17:32,375
Almost?

1488
02:17:32,958 --> 02:17:34,000
I guess.

1489
02:17:41,583 --> 02:17:43,041
You haven't changed.

1490
02:17:43,708 --> 02:17:46,416
You're still a big...

1491
02:17:46,500 --> 02:17:47,541
A big asshole, right?

1492
02:17:47,625 --> 02:17:48,916
I remember.

1493
02:17:59,333 --> 02:18:01,125
You won't kiss me, right?

1494
02:18:01,500 --> 02:18:03,208
I won't even hug you.

1495
02:18:19,208 --> 02:18:21,583
- Drama queen!
- I am.

1496
02:18:38,291 --> 02:18:40,208
<i>Look how popular I am!</i>

1497
02:18:41,666 --> 02:18:43,916
I was a dean for 25 years and...

1498
02:18:44,291 --> 02:18:47,000
today about seven students
have come to meet me.

1499
02:18:49,333 --> 02:18:51,791
I suppose, it's my fault.

1500
02:18:52,333 --> 02:18:54,541
I couldn't handle my relationships.

1501
02:18:57,291 --> 02:18:59,875
So, got busy breaking others'.

1502
02:20:07,958 --> 02:20:09,458
<i>Everyone has friends...</i>

1503
02:20:09,833 --> 02:20:12,625
<i>but school and college
friends are different.</i>

1504
02:20:14,666 --> 02:20:16,791
<i>They understand us like our parents do.</i>

1505
02:20:17,583 --> 02:20:18,958
<i>They know us.</i>

1506
02:20:19,500 --> 02:20:21,000
<i>Friction, envy, competition...</i>

1507
02:20:21,125 --> 02:20:23,541
<i>no matter what it goes through,</i>

1508
02:20:24,375 --> 02:20:26,083
<i>it never clouds the heart!</i>

1509
02:20:30,750 --> 02:20:32,875
<i>We have a chance after ten years.</i>

1510
02:20:33,500 --> 02:20:36,083
<i>Now, this friendship will not break.</i>

1511
02:20:41,166 --> 02:20:42,833
<i>Just one business was unfinished.</i>

1512
02:20:44,625 --> 02:20:46,958
- A big asshole, right?
- A big asshole, right?

1513
02:20:47,083 --> 02:20:48,291
Run!
