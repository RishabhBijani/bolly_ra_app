1
00:01:57,896 --> 00:01:59,436
Hey man, get up.

2
00:02:00,311 --> 00:02:02,572
Can't you hear? - Are you deaf?

3
00:02:03,103 --> 00:02:05,194
Kick his butt.
Then he'll understand.

4
00:02:16,373 --> 00:02:18,804
Have you reserved the seat?

5
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:24,044
Quiet! Boss is sleeping.

6
00:02:30,804 --> 00:02:32,443
Fauji Bhai's back.

7
00:02:37,864 --> 00:02:39,753
I'm coming.

8
00:04:05,493 --> 00:04:07,514
"I broke the tip-cat."

9
00:04:10,163 --> 00:04:12,583
"Threw the marbles."

10
00:04:15,604 --> 00:04:17,944
"I broke the tip-cat."
"Threw the marbles."

11
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:20,124
"And took up the gun."

12
00:04:20,283 --> 00:04:22,973
"I broke the tip-cat."
"Threw the marbles."

13
00:04:23,173 --> 00:04:25,203
"And took up the gun."

14
00:04:25,363 --> 00:04:30,043
"I roar, I snarl,
but can't be over-powered."

15
00:04:30,684 --> 00:04:35,154
"I sing,
dance, lock horns for no reason."

16
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:40,213
"I come first,
the rest come later."

17
00:04:40,494 --> 00:04:45,294
"This is district Ghaziabad."

18
00:04:45,574 --> 00:04:50,394
"This is district Ghaziabad."

19
00:04:50,944 --> 00:04:55,283
"I sing,
dance, lock horns for no reason."

20
00:04:55,634 --> 00:05:00,394
"I come first,
the rest come later."

21
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:05,454
"This is district Ghaziabad."

22
00:05:05,733 --> 00:05:10,533
"This is district Ghaziabad."

23
00:05:20,363 --> 00:05:24,903
"Blood splatters.."

24
00:05:25,363 --> 00:05:30,213
"Blood splatters are common
like colours in festival."

25
00:05:30,504 --> 00:05:32,754
"The river runs red with blood."

26
00:05:32,923 --> 00:05:35,853
"Just like the bull
tramples the fields."

27
00:05:36,053 --> 00:05:40,763
"My actions are fearless."

28
00:05:41,043 --> 00:05:43,343
"My actions are fearless."

29
00:05:43,514 --> 00:05:45,924
"I scratch my foot with a knife."

30
00:05:46,103 --> 00:05:51,193
"Rumbles, thunders and
rains acid from the clouds."

31
00:05:51,483 --> 00:05:55,954
"I sing,
dance, lock horns for no reason."

32
00:05:56,274 --> 00:06:01,033
"I come first,
the rest come later."

33
00:06:01,303 --> 00:06:05,963
"This is district Ghaziabad."

34
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:11,144
"This is district Ghaziabad."

35
00:06:23,894 --> 00:06:25,824
Is this enough or should
I get more from the car?

36
00:06:34,033 --> 00:06:36,444
"This is district Ghaziabad."

37
00:06:36,624 --> 00:06:38,024
"This is district Ghaziabad."

38
00:06:38,223 --> 00:06:39,463
At least return our guns.

39
00:06:39,684 --> 00:06:41,194
We'll leave our jobs.

40
00:06:42,194 --> 00:06:43,144
One thing, brother.

41
00:06:43,264 --> 00:06:44,834
Do men and women stay together?

42
00:06:45,223 --> 00:06:47,043
Why would I come back if they did?

43
00:06:49,134 --> 00:06:51,374
Gandhiji's first principle
is 'non-violence'.

44
00:06:52,994 --> 00:06:57,854
"What bullets can't achieve,
sweet talks can."

45
00:06:58,343 --> 00:06:58,843
Repeat after me.

46
00:06:58,884 --> 00:07:05,084
"What bullets can't achieve,
sweet talks can!"

47
00:07:05,423 --> 00:07:06,423
Very good!

48
00:07:10,524 --> 00:07:11,524
Rahul.

49
00:07:13,644 --> 00:07:16,244
Boy. What mischief were you up to.

50
00:07:16,514 --> 00:07:18,093
Sorry, uncle.

51
00:07:20,043 --> 00:07:24,084
Uncle at home, but at school..
- Oops. Master.

52
00:07:25,913 --> 00:07:26,913
Concentrate.

53
00:07:27,274 --> 00:07:28,274
Children.

54
00:07:28,733 --> 00:07:33,763
I want every child
of my class to study hard.

55
00:07:35,093 --> 00:07:37,613
I want you to carve
a niche for yourselves..

56
00:07:38,403 --> 00:07:40,913
..so that the entire
country says proudly..

57
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:43,394
"He's from District Ghaziabad.

58
00:07:43,533 --> 00:07:46,993
We'll do it, Master.
- That's more like it.

59
00:07:48,244 --> 00:07:51,224
Ut seems uncle Sonpal was
watching English film at night.

60
00:07:58,593 --> 00:08:00,303
First pull it in
then let the smoke out.

61
00:08:03,134 --> 00:08:04,134
What the..

62
00:08:04,384 --> 00:08:05,384
What's going on?

63
00:08:06,173 --> 00:08:07,173
Brother, this..

64
00:08:07,303 --> 00:08:08,303
This isn't mine.

65
00:08:08,494 --> 00:08:10,414
Omi, here's your cigarette.
I don't want it.

66
00:08:11,223 --> 00:08:12,274
It's not mine.

67
00:08:13,314 --> 00:08:15,914
How dare you force
us to smoke? - Yes.

68
00:08:16,314 --> 00:08:19,084
They're teaching us bad habits,
brother.

69
00:08:19,684 --> 00:08:21,654
But, Omveer..

70
00:08:21,954 --> 00:08:23,163
Do you want a slap?

71
00:08:23,894 --> 00:08:24,894
Run!

72
00:08:26,353 --> 00:08:27,753
Goodbye, brother!
It wasn't me, brother!

73
00:08:27,894 --> 00:08:29,293
It's not my fault.

74
00:08:29,434 --> 00:08:32,574
I know who ordered the cigarettes.

75
00:08:33,504 --> 00:08:34,994
Listen to me, both of you.

76
00:08:35,793 --> 00:08:38,634
If I ever catch you two
smoking again.. - No, brother.

77
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:40,123
I will break your legs.

78
00:08:40,254 --> 00:08:42,584
Never. Never again.

79
00:08:42,823 --> 00:08:45,313
Forgive us.

80
00:08:46,033 --> 00:08:47,234
Fine, I forgive you.

81
00:08:49,923 --> 00:08:51,703
Those rascals ran away. - Yes.

82
00:08:51,854 --> 00:08:52,974
Satbeer. - Yes.

83
00:08:53,543 --> 00:08:55,283
Why don't you move to Delhi?

84
00:08:55,844 --> 00:08:56,844
You're well educated.

85
00:08:57,943 --> 00:08:59,003
You'll make some good money.

86
00:08:59,663 --> 00:09:01,764
Why don't you think
about your future?

87
00:09:02,443 --> 00:09:03,443
No, brother.

88
00:09:04,793 --> 00:09:05,833
I want to stay here.

89
00:09:07,903 --> 00:09:09,443
And mend the future of my village.

90
00:09:18,254 --> 00:09:21,313
If you don't bring the remote-
controlled car for me this time..

91
00:09:21,524 --> 00:09:23,144
..I won't talk to you.

92
00:09:23,293 --> 00:09:24,293
I see.

93
00:09:24,703 --> 00:09:26,923
I promise, whether your
father returns or not..

94
00:09:27,173 --> 00:09:28,843
..but you'll surely get your car.
Okay?

95
00:09:29,423 --> 00:09:31,793
My son, I can just eat you.

96
00:09:33,874 --> 00:09:35,173
Go to your mother.

97
00:09:35,403 --> 00:09:36,403
Aye, General.

98
00:09:41,474 --> 00:09:42,604
Mother. - Bless you.

99
00:09:43,004 --> 00:09:44,004
Look after yourself.

100
00:09:44,134 --> 00:09:46,474
Mother, there's no reason to worry.

101
00:09:49,254 --> 00:09:50,553
Look after mother. - Yes, mother.

102
00:09:50,764 --> 00:09:52,153
One more thing. - Yes.

103
00:09:52,573 --> 00:09:54,933
No more cigarettes. - No. Brother..

104
00:09:55,234 --> 00:09:56,184
It wasn't me..

105
00:09:56,303 --> 00:09:57,713
Yes, yes. I know.

106
00:09:58,234 --> 00:09:59,234
Hello!

107
00:10:00,274 --> 00:10:02,114
Master, the president's
called for you.

108
00:10:02,714 --> 00:10:04,414
Fine.
Tell him I'll be right there.

109
00:10:04,803 --> 00:10:05,803
Okay.

110
00:10:06,173 --> 00:10:07,173
Listen.

111
00:10:07,783 --> 00:10:09,994
Why has the chairman called you?
- Don't know, brother.

112
00:10:10,163 --> 00:10:13,193
Maybe he wants some legal advice.

113
00:10:13,533 --> 00:10:17,644
Look, keep a distance from
this chairman. - Yes, brother.

114
00:10:18,634 --> 00:10:19,634
Take care.

115
00:10:20,894 --> 00:10:21,894
Mother.

116
00:10:25,293 --> 00:10:26,723
Raise your hands.

117
00:10:28,514 --> 00:10:30,364
Do I have to tell you separately?

118
00:10:31,153 --> 00:10:33,563
They're really ashamed
on their actions.

119
00:10:33,744 --> 00:10:34,744
Get lost.

120
00:10:35,014 --> 00:10:36,354
Hands up! Straight up!

121
00:10:37,604 --> 00:10:39,144
If you could solve this problem..

122
00:10:39,283 --> 00:10:40,413
..they won't get fired.

123
00:10:42,813 --> 00:10:43,813
Look.

124
00:10:44,153 --> 00:10:45,354
Welcome, night-hunter.

125
00:10:48,913 --> 00:10:49,563
Hello.

126
00:10:49,673 --> 00:10:50,693
Hello!

127
00:10:51,634 --> 00:10:54,204
You could touch my feet?

128
00:10:54,614 --> 00:10:56,394
I never touched my
father's feet either.

129
00:10:56,543 --> 00:10:58,884
Yes, it will give you a backache.

130
00:10:59,203 --> 00:11:00,903
Get to the point, Chairman.

131
00:11:01,104 --> 00:11:02,264
Do you know him?

132
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:03,583
Him?

133
00:11:05,244 --> 00:11:06,244
Who are you?

134
00:11:07,163 --> 00:11:08,673
Chawli's President.

135
00:11:09,474 --> 00:11:11,564
Last night you robbed his bus.

136
00:11:13,724 --> 00:11:18,164
I know, deliver two lakhs
to my manor, and take your bus.

137
00:11:18,614 --> 00:11:20,124
Okay? - Yes.

138
00:11:20,264 --> 00:11:22,014
Now get going.
Get going.

139
00:11:23,494 --> 00:11:24,814
And, the inspector.

140
00:11:25,354 --> 00:11:27,364
Son, I had arranged for everything.

141
00:11:27,903 --> 00:11:29,803
So why snatch his rifles?

142
00:11:30,403 --> 00:11:33,063
If he acts smart,
won't I snatch his rifle?

143
00:11:33,543 --> 00:11:35,063
It's only because we've
a good rapport with the police..

144
00:11:35,203 --> 00:11:36,853
..or I would've taken
their clothes and beaten them..

145
00:11:37,004 --> 00:11:38,004
..black and blue.

146
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:39,343
Rascal.

147
00:11:39,453 --> 00:11:40,524
Forgive us, sir.

148
00:11:41,104 --> 00:11:43,694
Excuse me, brother-in-law,
but can I say something? - What?

149
00:11:44,114 --> 00:11:45,624
You're no longer
respected in this city.

150
00:11:45,844 --> 00:11:47,584
Any cop humiliates your men now.

151
00:11:47,734 --> 00:11:49,464
How about a slap?

152
00:12:10,943 --> 00:12:11,943
Greetings.

153
00:12:13,994 --> 00:12:16,594
Just give me a hug, Master.

154
00:12:19,524 --> 00:12:21,604
Inspector,
he's the Master (teacher).

155
00:12:22,504 --> 00:12:25,114
Most educated and sexful
person in the village.

156
00:12:26,844 --> 00:12:27,724
That's successful.

157
00:12:27,844 --> 00:12:31,354
He got it,
he's not that stupid. - Yes.

158
00:12:32,234 --> 00:12:35,114
So, how are you doing?
- Just fine, Master.

159
00:12:35,313 --> 00:12:36,463
Fakira. How are you?

160
00:12:38,073 --> 00:12:39,073
No, no. Not there.

161
00:12:40,014 --> 00:12:41,014
Get up.

162
00:12:41,303 --> 00:12:42,303
Get up you fool.

163
00:12:45,043 --> 00:12:45,874
Sorry.

164
00:12:45,994 --> 00:12:46,934
Come.

165
00:12:47,053 --> 00:12:49,093
This is your place. Next to me.

166
00:12:50,413 --> 00:12:53,484
'Brother-in-law.
My time will come too.'

167
00:12:54,624 --> 00:12:55,624
Mr. Chairman, I..

168
00:12:56,903 --> 00:12:58,094
I forgot all about you.

169
00:12:59,823 --> 00:13:01,033
Deliver 100,000.

170
00:13:01,293 --> 00:13:02,723
You'll get your rifle.

171
00:13:03,004 --> 00:13:04,004
Thank you, sir.

172
00:13:04,604 --> 00:13:05,874
That plot..

173
00:13:06,303 --> 00:13:07,913
Get that plot vacated.

174
00:13:08,433 --> 00:13:10,153
Rashid has seized it again.

175
00:13:10,423 --> 00:13:11,923
I've been humiliated
all over the city.

176
00:13:12,214 --> 00:13:13,444
Just throw him out.

177
00:13:13,953 --> 00:13:16,993
Chairman sir, don't complain
if a few men get killed.

178
00:13:17,244 --> 00:13:19,283
I want that plot back at any cost.

179
00:13:20,104 --> 00:13:22,054
And, I don't care how many die.

180
00:13:22,214 --> 00:13:23,214
Just get him.

181
00:13:23,403 --> 00:13:24,403
Fine.

182
00:13:24,974 --> 00:13:26,533
Listen.

183
00:13:27,293 --> 00:13:29,183
Use your hands, not bullets.

184
00:13:29,344 --> 00:13:30,814
Elections are round the corner.

185
00:13:31,903 --> 00:13:33,403
What are you staring at?

186
00:13:33,724 --> 00:13:35,714
Get going. Lazy-bone.
Always..

187
00:13:35,884 --> 00:13:37,313
Look at him walk
like a pregnant woman.

188
00:13:37,453 --> 00:13:40,853
I'm guess men in your
family bear children, not us.

189
00:13:41,734 --> 00:13:43,364
Bulls-eye!

190
00:13:47,203 --> 00:13:49,274
What happened? - No. Nothing.

191
00:13:49,673 --> 00:13:51,903
Suman, get some tea. - Yes, father.

192
00:13:54,423 --> 00:13:55,723
Chairman sir.

193
00:13:56,144 --> 00:13:57,354
I fail to understand..

194
00:13:57,484 --> 00:13:59,894
..why you don't take up
this land case in the court.

195
00:14:00,193 --> 00:14:02,894
Master, I could go to the court
if I had all the papers..

196
00:14:03,303 --> 00:14:06,374
..and I also tried to
get it from the record room.

197
00:14:06,823 --> 00:14:09,723
But the land's worth millions.
And, it's good for nothing.

198
00:14:10,043 --> 00:14:12,593
You can handover
your incomplete papers..

199
00:14:12,783 --> 00:14:14,724
..and incomplete tasks to me.

200
00:14:15,153 --> 00:14:16,254
I will complete them.

201
00:14:16,494 --> 00:14:21,014
If I can be of some use to you,
it'll make me really happy.

202
00:14:21,283 --> 00:14:23,073
Thank you.

203
00:14:23,524 --> 00:14:24,764
Why don't you try?

204
00:14:24,894 --> 00:14:25,844
Of course.

205
00:14:25,974 --> 00:14:28,174
Bullets couldn't solve
this problem nor violence.

206
00:14:29,423 --> 00:14:31,853
Just stun them with your violence.

207
00:14:32,183 --> 00:14:33,894
They will feel humiliated.

208
00:14:42,964 --> 00:14:46,644
If you leave without meeting me,
then you're in for trouble.

209
00:14:53,913 --> 00:14:54,943
Biscuit? - No.

210
00:14:55,844 --> 00:14:56,844
Thanks.

211
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:58,483
How about a kiss?

212
00:15:00,823 --> 00:15:02,053
So, when is Karam returning?

213
00:15:02,293 --> 00:15:04,713
Brother will return
only after two months now.

214
00:15:04,994 --> 00:15:06,824
Is everything okay?
- Everything's just fine.

215
00:15:07,474 --> 00:15:08,354
So, goodbye.

216
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:10,334
And, also check up
on the Loni Road's tender.

217
00:15:10,734 --> 00:15:12,394
Don't worry, Chairman sir.

218
00:15:12,683 --> 00:15:14,004
See you then. Goodbye.

219
00:15:14,403 --> 00:15:15,403
See you.

220
00:15:18,854 --> 00:15:19,854
Who's that?

221
00:15:21,653 --> 00:15:23,193
You think you can
leave without seeing me.

222
00:15:24,504 --> 00:15:26,334
Come in. I'll dry them in a jiffy.

223
00:15:26,494 --> 00:15:28,264
Come in.
Don't be shy.

224
00:15:28,453 --> 00:15:30,394
What will the people say
if you go out wearing wet clothes?

225
00:15:30,563 --> 00:15:31,623
You're our guest.

226
00:15:31,813 --> 00:15:33,033
Father, say something.

227
00:15:33,163 --> 00:15:34,683
Come on, it won't take too long.

228
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:36,393
No need.
- It won't take two minute.

229
00:15:36,614 --> 00:15:37,694
Oh no!

230
00:15:41,604 --> 00:15:46,134
Will you take your clothes off,
or will I have to do that?

231
00:15:51,724 --> 00:15:52,724
Here you go.

232
00:15:53,903 --> 00:15:55,533
And this one? - I..

233
00:16:02,624 --> 00:16:03,624
Suman.

234
00:16:14,543 --> 00:16:15,713
Master.

235
00:16:22,293 --> 00:16:24,274
By the way,
how are your studies going?

236
00:16:24,573 --> 00:16:26,193
I'll surely fail this time.

237
00:16:26,644 --> 00:16:27,864
Fail? Why?

238
00:16:29,073 --> 00:16:29,993
What to do?

239
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:32,004
I can't concentrate
on studies these days.

240
00:16:32,903 --> 00:16:35,974
By the way,
I was thinking of getting married.

241
00:16:37,303 --> 00:16:40,083
"I never thought from this angle."

242
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:48,524
Okay...I'm leaving.

243
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:52,483
Master. - Yes.

244
00:17:03,923 --> 00:17:04,923
By the way..

245
00:17:06,044 --> 00:17:07,044
Yes!

246
00:17:07,253 --> 00:17:09,683
I've a complaint. - With me?

247
00:17:11,483 --> 00:17:13,943
These days...you pay no heed to me.

248
00:17:18,394 --> 00:17:20,263
I can never forget you, Suman.

249
00:17:43,584 --> 00:17:46,574
"I'm completely bowled over."

250
00:17:46,773 --> 00:17:49,753
"The heart's in love."

251
00:17:49,953 --> 00:17:52,844
"I'm completely bowled over."

252
00:17:53,044 --> 00:17:56,644
"The heart's in love."

253
00:17:57,054 --> 00:17:59,834
"What's this confusion?"

254
00:18:00,034 --> 00:18:02,924
"There's no solution."

255
00:18:03,233 --> 00:18:08,253
"Love's a strange riddle."

256
00:18:08,663 --> 00:18:12,033
"What's this confusion?"

257
00:18:12,423 --> 00:18:15,273
"There's no solution."

258
00:18:15,644 --> 00:18:21,223
"Love's a strange riddle."

259
00:18:21,673 --> 00:18:23,163
"The lanes of love."

260
00:18:23,304 --> 00:18:24,694
"Are filled with flowers."

261
00:18:24,834 --> 00:18:26,984
"It's filled with fragrance."

262
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:31,653
"Let's fly with the breeze
and meet beyond the clouds."

263
00:18:31,973 --> 00:18:34,763
"I can never forget you."

264
00:18:35,104 --> 00:18:37,874
"I can never forget you."

265
00:18:38,203 --> 00:18:40,943
"How can I forget you?"

266
00:18:41,294 --> 00:18:43,974
"I can never forget you."

267
00:18:44,173 --> 00:18:47,374
"I'm completely bowled over."

268
00:18:47,594 --> 00:18:50,514
"The heart's in love."

269
00:19:09,663 --> 00:19:15,153
"Why does the moon...peek
at me though the windows?"

270
00:19:22,124 --> 00:19:27,493
"Why does the moon peek
at me though the windows?"

271
00:19:28,304 --> 00:19:33,694
"When I looked,
it hid behind the clouds."

272
00:19:34,153 --> 00:19:40,344
"Counting the night away,
awaiting for the dawn."

273
00:19:41,044 --> 00:19:42,454
"The lanes of love."

274
00:19:42,594 --> 00:19:44,034
"Are filled with flowers."

275
00:19:44,173 --> 00:19:46,283
"It's filled with fragrance."

276
00:19:46,663 --> 00:19:50,993
"Let's fly with the breeze
and meet beyond the clouds."

277
00:19:51,253 --> 00:19:54,053
"I can never forget you."

278
00:19:54,344 --> 00:19:57,124
"I can never forget you."

279
00:19:57,463 --> 00:20:00,263
"How can I forget you?"

280
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:03,284
"I can never forget you."

281
00:20:03,564 --> 00:20:06,564
"I'm completely bowled over."

282
00:20:06,763 --> 00:20:09,673
"The heart's in love."

283
00:20:09,874 --> 00:20:12,834
"I'm completely bowled over."

284
00:20:13,044 --> 00:20:15,954
"The heart's in love."

285
00:20:16,153 --> 00:20:19,044
"I'm completely bowled over."

286
00:20:19,243 --> 00:20:23,023
"The heart's in love."

287
00:20:44,114 --> 00:20:45,114
Stop here.

288
00:21:55,523 --> 00:21:58,013
You're all just a bunch of cowards.

289
00:21:58,253 --> 00:21:59,803
Brother, Fauji attacked suddenly..

290
00:22:00,993 --> 00:22:03,903
You cowards can't handle Fauji.

291
00:22:05,284 --> 00:22:06,284
Rashid.

292
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:09,224
No need to get so angry.

293
00:22:09,523 --> 00:22:10,963
What else do you want me to do?

294
00:22:11,233 --> 00:22:13,513
Play this game of
seizure all my life?

295
00:22:14,104 --> 00:22:17,183
Sometimes me or
sometimes that Chairman..

296
00:22:17,443 --> 00:22:20,783
And all this,
is because of that Fauji.

297
00:22:21,324 --> 00:22:22,614
I don't know what to do with him?

298
00:22:22,743 --> 00:22:27,113
Think about getting rid
of the Chairman, not Fauji.

299
00:22:27,794 --> 00:22:28,814
Mother, I think..

300
00:22:30,973 --> 00:22:33,884
This matter won't be resolved..

301
00:22:34,203 --> 00:22:35,983
..until there's some
more bloodshed. - No, Rashid.

302
00:22:36,493 --> 00:22:37,743
You won't do anything.

303
00:22:38,534 --> 00:22:40,094
I will handle this
matter personally.

304
00:22:40,294 --> 00:22:41,304
What will you do?

305
00:22:42,513 --> 00:22:44,233
I will call for the
village council meeting.

306
00:22:50,513 --> 00:22:52,603
The power of attorney,
of this disputed plot..

307
00:22:53,074 --> 00:22:54,564
..was given to Mr. Sooraj Kumar.

308
00:22:54,703 --> 00:22:56,773
Who then sold it to my client Mr.
Rashid Ali.

309
00:22:57,493 --> 00:22:59,063
Here are the power
of attorney papers..

310
00:22:59,213 --> 00:23:00,094
..and purchase agreements.

311
00:23:00,213 --> 00:23:02,134
So, on what grounds can you say..

312
00:23:02,394 --> 00:23:04,274
..this plot belongs to Brahmpal
Chaudhary? - What..

313
00:23:05,124 --> 00:23:07,584
Seizing someone's
land by force is a crime.

314
00:23:07,763 --> 00:23:10,113
And I can get you arrested
under section 441.

315
00:23:11,534 --> 00:23:14,484
Chairman, how long will
you make false claims..

316
00:23:14,953 --> 00:23:16,733
..on these lands?

317
00:23:18,074 --> 00:23:20,864
Or do you still believe
we don't own this land?

318
00:23:21,104 --> 00:23:22,423
Liar. Cheat.

319
00:23:23,634 --> 00:23:24,923
You can check them.

320
00:23:30,013 --> 00:23:32,703
With the village council's
permission.. - Let it be.

321
00:23:34,433 --> 00:23:37,023
I would like to make a
plea on behalf of the chairman.

322
00:23:40,523 --> 00:23:42,813
I will plead this case
on behalf of my client..

323
00:23:42,993 --> 00:23:44,293
..chairman Brahmpal Chaudhary.

324
00:23:45,013 --> 00:23:46,583
The disputed land
legally belongs to him..

325
00:23:46,733 --> 00:23:48,443
..and I've all the
documents to prove it.

326
00:23:48,753 --> 00:23:50,653
The papers that you've presented
in front of the honourable

327
00:23:50,824 --> 00:23:52,394
'Panchayat' are fraudulent.

328
00:23:52,683 --> 00:23:54,163
In our terms..

329
00:23:54,973 --> 00:23:59,533
I can get your client Rashid
Ali jailed for three years..

330
00:24:00,544 --> 00:24:04,474
..under Indian Penal
Code 420 for fraud documents.

331
00:24:08,193 --> 00:24:09,193
Mr. Lawyer.

332
00:24:09,834 --> 00:24:13,054
Speaking in English doesn't
prove wrong to be right.

333
00:24:16,074 --> 00:24:16,774
First of all.

334
00:24:16,884 --> 00:24:19,054
The man your client
brought this land from..

335
00:24:19,614 --> 00:24:20,804
..never belonged to him.

336
00:24:21,763 --> 00:24:24,113
The power of attorney,
on the basis..

337
00:24:25,263 --> 00:24:27,033
..of which you're
making the claims..

338
00:24:27,394 --> 00:24:29,933
..was rejected seven days
prior to the date of purchase.

339
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:34,323
Here's the court's affidavit
and original documents.

340
00:24:35,574 --> 00:24:36,984
And the sale agreement's
attached with it.

341
00:24:37,163 --> 00:24:38,713
Made with the real
owner of the property..

342
00:24:39,483 --> 00:24:41,644
..which is in the name
of my client Brahmpal Chaudhary.

343
00:24:42,193 --> 00:24:43,193
Bhura. - Yes, brother.

344
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:44,793
Show it to the lawyer.
- Yes, brother.

345
00:24:47,203 --> 00:24:48,573
Take a good look, Mr. Lawyer.

346
00:24:48,713 --> 00:24:51,073
It's in English. And, there's a
Hindi copy attached too.

347
00:24:51,304 --> 00:24:52,304
What?

348
00:24:56,604 --> 00:24:57,604
Here.

349
00:25:04,844 --> 00:25:05,844
The papers are original.

350
00:25:08,634 --> 00:25:09,634
Fine.

351
00:25:10,064 --> 00:25:12,163
After reviewing these documents..

352
00:25:12,374 --> 00:25:14,134
..the village council has decided..

353
00:25:14,814 --> 00:25:17,794
..that the plot legally
belongs to Brahmpal Chaudhary.

354
00:25:18,663 --> 00:25:20,693
Wrong! Absolutely wrong!

355
00:25:21,243 --> 00:25:22,793
The council's giving
the wrong verdict.

356
00:25:22,943 --> 00:25:25,173
Look, Fatima.
If you have any objection..

357
00:25:25,394 --> 00:25:27,104
..then you're free
to approach the court.

358
00:25:27,324 --> 00:25:29,153
The council have given
their verdict. That's it.

359
00:25:31,394 --> 00:25:32,453
Didn't I tell you?

360
00:25:41,913 --> 00:25:44,104
Wonderful, Master. Wonderful.

361
00:25:46,483 --> 00:25:48,923
Mr. Lawyer, this isn't England.

362
00:25:49,564 --> 00:25:51,004
This is district Ghaziabad!

363
00:25:51,743 --> 00:25:53,773
Ghaziabad.
Long live brother Satbeer!

364
00:26:19,584 --> 00:26:23,714
"Youth is at its peak."

365
00:26:26,834 --> 00:26:30,764
"Youth is at its peak."

366
00:26:31,074 --> 00:26:34,494
"Everyone's after me."

367
00:26:34,804 --> 00:26:38,324
"I am the queen of Ghaziabad."

368
00:26:38,554 --> 00:26:41,634
"I am the queen of Ghaziabad."

369
00:26:41,834 --> 00:26:45,304
"My lover's here in-charge."

370
00:26:45,614 --> 00:26:47,244
"Don't think.."

371
00:26:47,463 --> 00:26:50,943
"Don't think I am yours."

372
00:26:51,213 --> 00:26:54,173
"Don't think I am yours."

373
00:26:54,804 --> 00:26:58,504
"Don't think I am yours."

374
00:26:58,733 --> 00:27:02,103
"Don't think I am yours."

375
00:27:02,394 --> 00:27:05,973
"I am the king of Ghaziabad."

376
00:27:06,203 --> 00:27:09,644
"Don't try to boss me around."

377
00:27:09,943 --> 00:27:11,364
"Why can't.."

378
00:27:11,554 --> 00:27:15,264
"Why can't you be mine?"

379
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:18,724
"Why can't you be mine?"

380
00:27:41,804 --> 00:27:45,714
"Your figure's so hot."

381
00:27:46,034 --> 00:27:49,594
"My heart's out of control."

382
00:27:49,814 --> 00:27:53,284
"I've nowhere to go."

383
00:27:53,554 --> 00:27:56,974
"That's your effect on me."

384
00:27:57,314 --> 00:28:00,774
"My kiss is not for free."

385
00:28:01,104 --> 00:28:04,254
"My kiss is not for free."

386
00:28:04,824 --> 00:28:08,344
"And he thinks of
taking me in his arms."

387
00:28:08,564 --> 00:28:11,634
"I am the queen of Ghaziabad."

388
00:28:11,844 --> 00:28:15,334
"My lover's here in-charge."

389
00:28:15,614 --> 00:28:17,134
"Don't think.."

390
00:28:17,394 --> 00:28:20,913
"Don't think I am yours."

391
00:28:21,213 --> 00:28:24,364
"Don't think I am yours."

392
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:28,483
"I am the king of Ghaziabad."

393
00:28:28,703 --> 00:28:32,134
"Don't try to boss me around."

394
00:28:32,473 --> 00:28:33,923
"Why can't.."

395
00:28:34,064 --> 00:28:37,804
"Why can't you be mine?"

396
00:28:38,094 --> 00:28:41,193
"Why can't you be mine?"

397
00:29:21,673 --> 00:29:25,104
"You might have a lot of lovers."

398
00:29:25,324 --> 00:29:28,903
"But there's none like me, try me."

399
00:29:30,564 --> 00:29:34,413
"You might have a lot of lovers."

400
00:29:34,653 --> 00:29:38,284
"But there's none like me, try me."

401
00:29:38,523 --> 00:29:41,653
"Big-hearted! Fearless!"

402
00:29:42,233 --> 00:29:45,653
"There's no one who can tower me."

403
00:29:45,993 --> 00:29:49,083
"I am the king of Ghaziabad."

404
00:29:49,284 --> 00:29:52,704
"I am the king of Ghaziabad."

405
00:29:52,933 --> 00:29:56,324
"The in-charge salutes me."

406
00:29:56,624 --> 00:29:58,124
"Why can't.."

407
00:29:58,523 --> 00:30:01,993
"Why can't you be mine?"

408
00:30:02,213 --> 00:30:05,903
"Why can't you be mine?"

409
00:30:06,144 --> 00:30:09,703
"Don't think I am yours."

410
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:13,023
"Don't think I am yours."

411
00:30:19,503 --> 00:30:20,613
"Get lost."

412
00:30:25,723 --> 00:30:28,293
I'm too drunk, buddy!

413
00:30:31,993 --> 00:30:33,063
Will you give it?

414
00:30:33,284 --> 00:30:34,304
What do you mean, sir?

415
00:30:34,634 --> 00:30:36,364
But you're willing
to give it, madam.

416
00:30:36,604 --> 00:30:37,604
Laon..

417
00:30:38,824 --> 00:30:39,844
Call back! Call back!

418
00:30:40,663 --> 00:30:41,384
Why did you kick me?

419
00:30:41,493 --> 00:30:42,283
What happened?
- Rascal.

420
00:30:42,394 --> 00:30:44,894
I sent you to the court
to register the plot in my name.

421
00:30:45,243 --> 00:30:47,394
But you got it registered
in your name instead.

422
00:30:48,034 --> 00:30:49,194
You've such a huge property.

423
00:30:49,324 --> 00:30:51,094
What difference does
it make if I take one?

424
00:30:51,243 --> 00:30:53,433
It does make a difference,
you think it's for free.

425
00:30:53,733 --> 00:30:54,733
Rascal.

426
00:30:55,173 --> 00:30:56,364
If sister was alive today..

427
00:30:56,503 --> 00:30:58,013
..she would've certainly
gifted me a few plots.

428
00:30:58,163 --> 00:31:00,423
I've been tolerating
you because of your sister.

429
00:31:00,604 --> 00:31:01,604
Get lost.

430
00:31:01,844 --> 00:31:04,124
If I ever see you here again,
I will stab you to death.

431
00:31:04,534 --> 00:31:06,054
To hell with you and your manor.

432
00:31:06,193 --> 00:31:07,283
Rascal..

433
00:31:07,443 --> 00:31:09,783
I'll never see your face again.

434
00:31:10,663 --> 00:31:11,943
The old man's lost it!

435
00:31:12,253 --> 00:31:14,894
He'll take his property
with him to heaven.

436
00:31:15,084 --> 00:31:16,804
What's wrong, Chairman?
Why are you beating him?

437
00:31:16,983 --> 00:31:20,063
You betrayer!

438
00:31:23,384 --> 00:31:24,753
So, what brings you here?

439
00:31:25,334 --> 00:31:27,124
Mahindri's getting
married next week.

440
00:31:27,364 --> 00:31:29,354
Great. - I needed some money.

441
00:31:30,034 --> 00:31:31,034
How much?

442
00:31:32,124 --> 00:31:33,473
Around two million.

443
00:31:34,213 --> 00:31:35,673
You will spend two million?

444
00:31:36,284 --> 00:31:37,494
My sister's getting
married after all.

445
00:31:37,624 --> 00:31:38,923
It'll definitely
cost around two million.

446
00:31:39,094 --> 00:31:40,203
I pay you handsomely..

447
00:31:40,624 --> 00:31:42,144
..and you also earn
from looting people.

448
00:31:42,374 --> 00:31:43,614
You should save
some money yourself.

449
00:31:43,963 --> 00:31:47,253
Or, do you squander
everything on women?

450
00:31:47,854 --> 00:31:49,223
No jokes, Chairman.

451
00:31:50,253 --> 00:31:52,913
Either you give the
money or just say no.

452
00:31:53,273 --> 00:31:55,233
You know how business is doing.

453
00:31:56,374 --> 00:31:57,453
Two million is impossible.

454
00:31:58,403 --> 00:32:00,423
I can arrange for one million.

455
00:32:00,834 --> 00:32:02,374
You can keep that to yourself.

456
00:32:02,884 --> 00:32:06,364
I can arrange for the entire
money from somewhere else..

457
00:32:06,884 --> 00:32:07,894
You can keep your money.

458
00:32:08,423 --> 00:32:10,663
Hey.. - I don't
want to hear anything.

459
00:32:10,894 --> 00:32:12,943
Stop.

460
00:32:13,114 --> 00:32:14,703
Don't get angry.
Hey..

461
00:32:14,854 --> 00:32:15,713
Fauji bhai.

462
00:32:15,824 --> 00:32:18,014
Fauji bhai, I've brought a
new car.. - To hell with your car.

463
00:32:19,614 --> 00:32:21,054
Let's go!
- Fauji.

464
00:32:22,374 --> 00:32:23,324
He's gone mad.

465
00:32:23,443 --> 00:32:24,533
What's this behaviour?

466
00:32:25,153 --> 00:32:27,203
He's just venting his anger.

467
00:32:27,544 --> 00:32:29,334
Come in. Come.
- I can get angry too.

468
00:32:30,473 --> 00:32:33,813
Next time he misbehaves,
I'll teach him some manners.

469
00:32:52,683 --> 00:32:53,723
You got the plot back.

470
00:32:54,344 --> 00:32:55,423
You killed people for it.

471
00:32:56,284 --> 00:32:58,994
That swine chairman must
have made billions because of you.

472
00:32:59,903 --> 00:33:02,423
And when he asked for two
million for his sister's marriage..

473
00:33:02,604 --> 00:33:04,163
..he just refused straightaway!

474
00:33:09,663 --> 00:33:13,334
Brother-in-law bought that car
for master in return of that plot.

475
00:33:14,523 --> 00:33:17,333
And, he's thinking of
starting some business for him.

476
00:33:19,403 --> 00:33:20,403
Hail Lord.

477
00:33:20,753 --> 00:33:22,043
I've told you so many times..

478
00:33:22,173 --> 00:33:23,634
..get rid of that
Master once and for all.

479
00:33:23,773 --> 00:33:26,563
But you never understand.

480
00:33:28,453 --> 00:33:29,913
He's been saying to everyone..

481
00:33:30,064 --> 00:33:31,944
..I'm the chairman's
future son-in-law.

482
00:33:34,894 --> 00:33:36,723
Chairman isn't being fair.

483
00:33:42,223 --> 00:33:43,343
Where's Fauji? - Tell us.

484
00:33:43,523 --> 00:33:45,093
Where's Fauji? - Tell us.

485
00:33:45,463 --> 00:33:46,634
Look for him inside.

486
00:33:47,923 --> 00:33:50,054
Mahindri, there are goons outside.
Don't open the door.

487
00:34:06,163 --> 00:34:07,163
Rascal..

488
00:34:21,724 --> 00:34:22,734
Mahindri..

489
00:34:27,653 --> 00:34:28,653
Why you..

490
00:34:28,943 --> 00:34:30,123
Swine!

491
00:34:36,954 --> 00:34:38,423
Master, Fauji isn't inside.

492
00:34:38,563 --> 00:34:41,344
Don't take his name,
Yes. - Let's get out of here.

493
00:34:50,514 --> 00:34:52,903
See if they've left
any clue behind. - Yes.

494
00:34:56,244 --> 00:34:58,074
They ruined the entire house.

495
00:35:01,554 --> 00:35:04,034
You should sit
at home like cowards.

496
00:35:04,523 --> 00:35:06,384
You claim to be a big goon.

497
00:35:06,543 --> 00:35:08,283
See what they've done.

498
00:35:09,083 --> 00:35:11,594
Shut up! Don't make me crazy.

499
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:14,634
They didn't leave any clue.

500
00:35:18,373 --> 00:35:20,463
Do you have any idea,
who they were?

501
00:35:20,634 --> 00:35:21,804
I don't have a clue.

502
00:35:21,934 --> 00:35:23,584
Their faces were covered.

503
00:35:24,103 --> 00:35:25,384
They held me at
the point of the gun..

504
00:35:25,523 --> 00:35:26,833
..otherwise I wouldn't
have spared them.

505
00:35:27,054 --> 00:35:29,943
They held you at point blank,
but they didn't shoot you.

506
00:35:30,963 --> 00:35:32,384
Being Fauji's brother
you were scared.

507
00:35:34,684 --> 00:35:35,994
What happened?

508
00:35:37,313 --> 00:35:38,313
Did they attack?

509
00:35:40,123 --> 00:35:41,893
I just found out.

510
00:35:43,423 --> 00:35:46,353
I told you to be
careful of that master.

511
00:35:46,784 --> 00:35:48,614
But you never listen to me.

512
00:35:49,534 --> 00:35:50,903
'Master, Fauji isn't here.'

513
00:35:51,043 --> 00:35:52,763
'Don't take his name.'

514
00:35:54,184 --> 00:35:57,173
Yes. They did mention
the Master's name.

515
00:35:59,793 --> 00:36:03,324
By the way, only Satbeer's
called master in this village.

516
00:36:05,713 --> 00:36:07,213
The dog.

517
00:36:07,733 --> 00:36:08,413
Get the car.

518
00:36:08,523 --> 00:36:09,523
Think before you leap.

519
00:36:10,434 --> 00:36:13,964
Come along if you want to,
or get lost. - Fine, let's go.

520
00:36:31,844 --> 00:36:33,364
Have you lost your mind?

521
00:36:33,603 --> 00:36:35,403
Master's the one who's gone crazy.

522
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:39,554
How dare he attack my house!
- No, no.

523
00:36:39,793 --> 00:36:42,074
Master cannot be behind this.

524
00:36:42,403 --> 00:36:43,923
You're surely mistaken, Fauji.

525
00:36:44,063 --> 00:36:45,344
Let's sit and talk.

526
00:36:45,474 --> 00:36:46,704
I don't want to hear anything.

527
00:36:46,963 --> 00:36:47,963
And better step aside..

528
00:36:48,094 --> 00:36:50,394
..or else I'll forsake all manners.

529
00:36:50,684 --> 00:36:51,684
Fine, listen.

530
00:36:52,224 --> 00:36:55,693
How do you know that
master's behind this?

531
00:36:56,583 --> 00:36:57,813
I heard it myself.

532
00:36:58,344 --> 00:36:59,864
One of them took the master's name.

533
00:37:00,164 --> 00:37:01,903
And only Satbeer's called master.

534
00:37:02,393 --> 00:37:05,403
Don't try to say that the
girl's lying, brother-in-law.

535
00:37:05,614 --> 00:37:06,713
Shut up, you rascal.

536
00:37:08,293 --> 00:37:10,844
I'll find this out myself.
- Go ahead.

537
00:37:13,563 --> 00:37:14,563
Look, Fauji.

538
00:37:14,943 --> 00:37:17,193
Whoever did this cannot escape?

539
00:37:17,744 --> 00:37:20,414
I will kill myself
at the village square.

540
00:37:21,003 --> 00:37:21,753
Okay.

541
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:23,923
But, give me until tomorrow.

542
00:37:24,123 --> 00:37:24,933
Tomorrow.

543
00:37:25,043 --> 00:37:26,903
I'll find this out myself. Okay?

544
00:37:28,023 --> 00:37:29,923
Fine. Tomorrow.

545
00:37:48,954 --> 00:37:50,124
Aunt. Aunt.

546
00:37:50,333 --> 00:37:51,523
Give me some. - Here.

547
00:37:52,744 --> 00:37:54,004
Aunt, give me a sweetmeat.
- Greetings, aunt.

548
00:37:54,393 --> 00:37:55,053
Give it.

549
00:37:55,164 --> 00:37:56,374
Get lost.

550
00:37:58,094 --> 00:38:00,884
Aunt, I know you're
worried because of Fauji.

551
00:38:01,543 --> 00:38:03,123
I tried to convince Fauji, that..

552
00:38:03,304 --> 00:38:06,074
..a respected man like master
can't do something like this.

553
00:38:07,483 --> 00:38:08,483
He's in a rage.

554
00:38:09,744 --> 00:38:11,804
And you know Fauji's
completely insane.

555
00:38:12,324 --> 00:38:13,704
He can do anything
in a fit of rage.

556
00:38:13,844 --> 00:38:15,463
Son, Fauji's your friend.

557
00:38:16,284 --> 00:38:17,574
You can convince him.

558
00:38:18,054 --> 00:38:19,934
Why will Satbeer do this with him?

559
00:38:20,753 --> 00:38:22,344
Don't be disheartened, aunt.

560
00:38:22,753 --> 00:38:24,063
I'm like your younger son.

561
00:38:24,744 --> 00:38:26,653
That Fauji can't lay a finger..

562
00:38:27,034 --> 00:38:30,443
..on master, as long as I am there.
- Bless you.

563
00:38:30,673 --> 00:38:34,304
Aunt. Just don't let the master
out of the house for a few days.

564
00:38:35,403 --> 00:38:36,594
I'll handle the rest.

565
00:38:37,213 --> 00:38:38,353
Bless me. - Fine.

566
00:38:41,094 --> 00:38:43,364
Lord, bless me.

567
00:38:49,403 --> 00:38:50,813
Greetings, sister-in-law.
I'll be right back.

568
00:38:51,003 --> 00:38:52,943
Do you have to go now?

569
00:38:53,193 --> 00:38:55,083
I'll have to clear
Fauji's misconception.

570
00:38:55,403 --> 00:38:57,074
And, the sooner the better.

571
00:39:00,123 --> 00:39:01,123
Hello! - Hello!

572
00:39:01,244 --> 00:39:02,244
Hello. - Bless you!

573
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:03,673
Look, Satbeer!

574
00:39:04,414 --> 00:39:06,804
Acting in haste
can make things worse.

575
00:39:07,153 --> 00:39:10,764
But, uncle. I don't see
the harm in talking to him once.

576
00:39:11,503 --> 00:39:13,683
We didn't attack Fauji's home..

577
00:39:14,494 --> 00:39:16,213
..so, there's nothing
to be afraid of.

578
00:39:16,403 --> 00:39:18,733
But, brother Satbeer,
will Fauji understand?

579
00:39:19,233 --> 00:39:21,994
I'm not going there
to brawl with him.

580
00:39:22,414 --> 00:39:24,434
I'll just go talk to him. - Fine.

581
00:39:25,264 --> 00:39:27,334
We'll come along too. - Not again.

582
00:39:27,943 --> 00:39:30,054
I'm just going to talk to him,
not fight a war.

583
00:39:31,043 --> 00:39:33,763
Fine. We'll stand
behind and hear you talk.

584
00:39:36,773 --> 00:39:39,193
Omi, your brother's not that weak.

585
00:39:40,893 --> 00:39:42,033
What if something goes wrong?

586
00:39:42,164 --> 00:39:43,614
Don't worry.
Everything will be just fine.

587
00:39:43,753 --> 00:39:44,753
Look, mother's back.

588
00:39:45,123 --> 00:39:46,123
Mother!

589
00:39:47,094 --> 00:39:48,503
Hello. - Hello, hello.

590
00:39:48,914 --> 00:39:49,914
Greetings. - Bless you.

591
00:39:50,153 --> 00:39:51,713
Try to convince your son.

592
00:39:51,853 --> 00:39:53,473
He's going to meet Fauji. - Yes.

593
00:40:01,634 --> 00:40:02,543
What are you doing, mother?

594
00:40:02,664 --> 00:40:03,664
Where are you going?

595
00:40:03,884 --> 00:40:06,784
I was just going to meet Fauji..
- No need to meet that madman.

596
00:40:07,353 --> 00:40:08,423
But, mother, I..

597
00:40:08,793 --> 00:40:09,793
Mother.

598
00:40:10,054 --> 00:40:11,124
Mother, listen to me.

599
00:40:11,844 --> 00:40:13,923
I didn't know you're
so scared of that Fauji?

600
00:40:19,414 --> 00:40:21,954
It's your temper that scares me,
not him.

601
00:40:22,574 --> 00:40:26,574
For my sake,
you won't step out until I say so.

602
00:40:28,373 --> 00:40:30,363
That's not fair, mother. You always
bound me with your oaths.

603
00:40:30,534 --> 00:40:32,204
Brother,
listen to what mother says.

604
00:40:37,333 --> 00:40:38,713
I just don't get it.

605
00:40:39,264 --> 00:40:42,193
Do we need that chairman's
order to take revenge?

606
00:40:42,724 --> 00:40:43,774
Let's wait until tomorrow.

607
00:40:44,664 --> 00:40:45,994
Otherwise, the chairman will say..

608
00:40:46,384 --> 00:40:48,164
..that Fauji didn't
respect his word.

609
00:40:48,443 --> 00:40:50,253
Try to understand. - Fine.

610
00:40:51,594 --> 00:40:53,594
Listen to that chairman.

611
00:40:54,063 --> 00:40:55,783
He says "Stand
up" and you stand up.

612
00:40:56,233 --> 00:40:58,273
He says "Sit down"
and you sit down.

613
00:41:00,344 --> 00:41:01,963
Today that master
has spread his wings.

614
00:41:02,494 --> 00:41:04,184
Tomorrow, it'll be someone else.

615
00:41:04,574 --> 00:41:07,963
Mahindri's absolutely right,
brother. Don't delay anymore.

616
00:41:09,293 --> 00:41:13,293
That master,
how did he grow so courageous?

617
00:41:13,813 --> 00:41:15,503
No need to think too much.

618
00:41:16,713 --> 00:41:18,503
Let's kill him today..

619
00:41:18,934 --> 00:41:21,024
..before he becomes
a problem for us tomorrow.

620
00:41:21,724 --> 00:41:23,594
I've been trying
to tell brother that.

621
00:41:24,344 --> 00:41:25,644
If he was telling the truth..

622
00:41:25,884 --> 00:41:27,483
..he would've spoken
to you about it.

623
00:41:28,204 --> 00:41:30,744
The longer you take,
the more time he gets to prepare.

624
00:41:31,054 --> 00:41:33,684
Will the chairman help
us in the master's matter?

625
00:41:35,123 --> 00:41:36,863
He's his future
son-in-law after all.

626
00:41:37,523 --> 00:41:38,673
Rascal.

627
00:41:39,344 --> 00:41:41,023
We've to fix this chairman.

628
00:41:43,313 --> 00:41:44,463
I've...

629
00:41:47,123 --> 00:41:48,243
I've...a solution!

630
00:42:03,713 --> 00:42:06,833
Fauji, I've countless enemies,
and some really bad.

631
00:42:07,563 --> 00:42:11,423
But, Rashid never touched
their family. Swear on God!

632
00:42:12,923 --> 00:42:13,923
Okay.

633
00:42:15,143 --> 00:42:16,673
You worked with
chairman for so long..

634
00:42:17,193 --> 00:42:18,634
..but what did you get?

635
00:42:19,893 --> 00:42:21,273
Anyway, forget it..
Hey, hand it over.

636
00:42:25,673 --> 00:42:27,423
A small token for your
younger sister's marriage.

637
00:42:27,583 --> 00:42:28,583
Five million.

638
00:42:29,423 --> 00:42:30,744
Fauji, I'll give
you anything you want.

639
00:42:31,213 --> 00:42:33,014
Join my gang,
and you'll have equal position.

640
00:42:33,164 --> 00:42:34,224
Just like Rashid.

641
00:42:35,614 --> 00:42:37,844
And if I ever make a mistake..

642
00:42:38,494 --> 00:42:40,764
..then, it's your
gun and my forehead.

643
00:42:41,083 --> 00:42:44,123
You will get your due respect.

644
00:42:44,824 --> 00:42:46,074
And, leave the rest to me.

645
00:42:46,784 --> 00:42:50,434
From today,
all your enemies are mine too.

646
00:42:51,103 --> 00:42:52,103
What do you say?

647
00:42:53,583 --> 00:42:55,273
What more do you want?

648
00:42:55,673 --> 00:42:56,713
Rahat, pick up the bag.

649
00:42:57,123 --> 00:42:58,123
Shake hands.

650
00:42:58,684 --> 00:42:59,624
Shake hands.

651
00:42:59,744 --> 00:43:01,104
Don't think too much.

652
00:43:01,364 --> 00:43:02,764
Let's shake hands.

653
00:43:25,063 --> 00:43:27,773
Brahmpal's called for a
council meeting tomorrow, right?

654
00:43:51,724 --> 00:43:52,814
What's he doing here?

655
00:43:53,284 --> 00:43:54,804
Rashid's with me.

656
00:43:55,364 --> 00:43:58,894
And, I don't think his
presence should bother anyone.

657
00:44:00,873 --> 00:44:03,073
So, Chairman, got your answer?

658
00:44:03,934 --> 00:44:05,414
Go ahead, council. Start.

659
00:44:06,273 --> 00:44:08,733
Fauji. What's all this?

660
00:44:09,054 --> 00:44:11,923
We're all unhappy about
the attack on your house.

661
00:44:12,373 --> 00:44:15,173
But, you just can't
accuse anyone for it.

662
00:44:15,414 --> 00:44:16,674
And a man like Satbeer.

663
00:44:16,954 --> 00:44:18,374
You should be ashamed?

664
00:44:18,514 --> 00:44:20,394
Why should I be the only one?

665
00:44:21,804 --> 00:44:25,253
And, I know what
the Master's thinking.

666
00:44:26,804 --> 00:44:28,634
Pardon me,
but I'd like to say something

667
00:44:29,014 --> 00:44:29,914
You won't say a word.

668
00:44:30,034 --> 00:44:31,644
You can do what you like,
but I will speak today.

669
00:44:33,264 --> 00:44:34,784
Are you calling Mahindri a liar?

670
00:44:35,204 --> 00:44:38,774
She heard her attackers
take master's name.

671
00:44:39,503 --> 00:44:40,893
And let me tell you the truth.

672
00:44:41,824 --> 00:44:43,804
Master has his eyes on
brother-in-law's property.

673
00:44:45,434 --> 00:44:47,874
And, it wasn't possible
without getting rid of Fauji.

674
00:44:48,173 --> 00:44:50,623
So he thought, "Let's kill Fauji.."

675
00:44:50,893 --> 00:44:52,703
"..and take over the property."

676
00:44:52,864 --> 00:44:54,844
Rascal, don't try to teach me.

677
00:44:55,094 --> 00:44:56,523
I know who's behind all this.

678
00:44:56,673 --> 00:44:57,744
Calm down, everyone!

679
00:44:58,034 --> 00:45:00,594
Speak up, Satbeer.
What do you want to say?

680
00:45:01,074 --> 00:45:04,144
I've always respected
Fauji as an elder brother.

681
00:45:06,574 --> 00:45:10,124
And, Fauji,
I consider your sister like a kin.

682
00:45:13,094 --> 00:45:18,114
You should've thought
twice before accusing me.

683
00:45:18,634 --> 00:45:22,083
Master. You can convince
them with your preaching.

684
00:45:22,684 --> 00:45:24,364
You're not a lawyer yet.

685
00:45:24,643 --> 00:45:26,573
Stay in your skin. - Enough, Fauji!

686
00:45:27,543 --> 00:45:30,103
Just because I respect you
doesn't mean I'm a coward.

687
00:45:30,333 --> 00:45:32,013
Why you..

688
00:45:32,423 --> 00:45:33,744
How dare you threaten Fauji?
-Rascal.

689
00:45:33,884 --> 00:45:35,423
How dare you bring a gun here?

690
00:45:37,063 --> 00:45:38,953
Swine..

691
00:45:41,954 --> 00:45:43,664
Have you lost it, Fauji?

692
00:45:44,304 --> 00:45:46,153
Rascal, how dare you?

693
00:45:46,773 --> 00:45:49,784
You've shown your true colours.
You've become Rashid's pet now.

694
00:45:50,264 --> 00:45:51,264
Quiet!

695
00:45:57,324 --> 00:45:59,043
Fauji. Have you lost your mind?

696
00:45:59,293 --> 00:46:00,423
Listen, Chairman.

697
00:46:00,653 --> 00:46:02,844
We're going to seize your land.

698
00:46:03,333 --> 00:46:04,923
You can do anything you want.

699
00:46:05,574 --> 00:46:08,153
You're making him your son-in-law,
right? This master.

700
00:46:08,574 --> 00:46:10,664
I'll make your daughter a widow.

701
00:46:11,014 --> 00:46:13,193
Save him if you can.
Save him!

702
00:46:13,403 --> 00:46:14,853
Let's go, Fauji. - Let's go.

703
00:46:26,853 --> 00:46:28,023
If we don't do anything yet..

704
00:46:28,423 --> 00:46:29,893
..everyone will call us cowards.

705
00:46:30,043 --> 00:46:32,163
Hey.

706
00:46:32,773 --> 00:46:33,993
I'm still alive.

707
00:46:34,943 --> 00:46:37,163
And you don't need
to get into this.

708
00:46:38,264 --> 00:46:41,074
Five men are dead.
Do you want to get us killed too?

709
00:46:41,373 --> 00:46:42,884
Omi, be quiet!

710
00:46:43,764 --> 00:46:44,764
Don't talk too much.

711
00:46:47,293 --> 00:46:48,293
Chairman.

712
00:46:49,344 --> 00:46:51,094
We don't want to get
into this mess either.

713
00:46:51,583 --> 00:46:54,713
But, if we're dragged in this,
then we won't stay quiet!

714
00:46:55,423 --> 00:46:59,574
Master, violence and
bloodshed is not your subject.

715
00:47:00,134 --> 00:47:01,244
Let me deal with that.

716
00:47:01,673 --> 00:47:03,454
This village needs you.

717
00:47:03,764 --> 00:47:05,164
So, focus on that.

718
00:47:05,304 --> 00:47:07,334
Okay. - That's only if he lives.

719
00:47:07,623 --> 00:47:08,623
Shut up!

720
00:47:08,773 --> 00:47:12,413
Whatever. We'll have to
deal with that Fauji permanently.

721
00:47:14,603 --> 00:47:16,783
Don't worry,
leave that to me. Okay.

722
00:47:16,954 --> 00:47:18,443
Everyone please
go back to your homes.

723
00:47:18,784 --> 00:47:19,784
Go.

724
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:32,014
Mother.

725
00:47:34,304 --> 00:47:35,503
I had warned you..

726
00:47:36,514 --> 00:47:38,024
What if the bullet
had hit somewhere else?

727
00:47:39,353 --> 00:47:40,553
I tried telling you.

728
00:47:41,333 --> 00:47:42,553
Don't get into this mess.

729
00:47:43,074 --> 00:47:44,804
But you never understand.

730
00:47:45,233 --> 00:47:47,183
Madam, don't worry.

731
00:47:47,523 --> 00:47:48,853
I won't spare that Fauji.

732
00:47:49,664 --> 00:47:50,664
Believe me.

733
00:47:54,273 --> 00:47:55,273
Come with me.

734
00:48:05,963 --> 00:48:07,193
Today, in Ghaziabad..

735
00:48:07,333 --> 00:48:10,953
..Fauji killed a village
head in the council meeting.

736
00:48:11,293 --> 00:48:12,813
And shot at Brahmpal Chairman..

737
00:48:12,954 --> 00:48:15,443
..with the intentions
of murdering him..

738
00:48:15,684 --> 00:48:19,384
..which in turn hit Satbeer
while trying to save him.

739
00:48:19,704 --> 00:48:21,474
Brahmpal's supporters
staged road-blocks..

740
00:48:21,634 --> 00:48:24,563
..in different parts of the city
to protest against this incident.

741
00:48:25,043 --> 00:48:27,293
Fauji, whose a
history-sheeter criminal..

742
00:48:27,474 --> 00:48:29,173
..and was recently
released from jail..

743
00:48:29,393 --> 00:48:32,063
..has already started
terrorising the city.

744
00:48:32,353 --> 00:48:35,083
Fauji used to work
for Brahmpal Chairman.

745
00:48:35,393 --> 00:48:39,293
But his recent alliance with
Brahmpal's political rival Rashid Ali..

746
00:48:39,543 --> 00:48:41,973
..has sparked the rumours
of a gang war once again.

747
00:48:42,233 --> 00:48:43,233
Sir.

748
00:48:45,634 --> 00:48:46,514
What's going on?

749
00:48:46,634 --> 00:48:48,844
And no police officer's
ready to take any action.

750
00:48:50,623 --> 00:48:52,884
A village-head was murdered in
broad-day light in your district.

751
00:48:53,474 --> 00:48:55,274
People are openly
rioting on the streets.

752
00:48:55,873 --> 00:48:57,993
If you can't handle the district,
then resign.

753
00:48:59,244 --> 00:49:03,294
Any...reaction from
chairman's gang? - No, sir.

754
00:49:03,824 --> 00:49:04,854
Nothing yet.

755
00:49:06,764 --> 00:49:10,423
Sir, I had a request. - Yes.

756
00:49:11,284 --> 00:49:13,894
Sir, please give us...Pritam Singh.

757
00:49:14,403 --> 00:49:15,434
Thakur Pritam Singh.

758
00:49:18,353 --> 00:49:19,634
You've lost your mind, Vinod.

759
00:49:23,103 --> 00:49:25,423
Sir, chairman's not going
to stay quiet after this.

760
00:49:26,074 --> 00:49:28,634
We need to stop them before
the gang war erupts in the area.

761
00:49:28,954 --> 00:49:31,034
So, we need Pritam Singh, please.

762
00:49:32,043 --> 00:49:34,403
He's more of a hoodlum,
then a police officer.

763
00:49:34,844 --> 00:49:36,864
Run! Pritam Singh is coming!

764
00:49:37,123 --> 00:49:39,013
He is mad. He will kill us.

765
00:49:41,134 --> 00:49:45,003
Pritam Singh gives everyone
one chance to live.

766
00:49:45,994 --> 00:49:47,423
Those who take it, live.

767
00:49:48,244 --> 00:49:49,914
Otherwise, they regret it later.

768
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:35,844
Sir. Just shoot them
and get this over with.

769
00:51:36,264 --> 00:51:37,414
Fool.

770
00:51:38,224 --> 00:51:40,334
The real fun of target practise..

771
00:51:41,264 --> 00:51:42,844
..is when your target's running.

772
00:51:43,744 --> 00:51:45,954
Shooting a still person..

773
00:51:47,153 --> 00:51:49,393
..is like bursting
balloons in the carnival.

774
00:51:51,653 --> 00:51:54,503
Start the car, I'll be right there.
- Yes, sir.

775
00:53:08,724 --> 00:53:11,224
Three SP's have been
suspended because of him.

776
00:53:11,914 --> 00:53:13,924
He's facing more inquiries..

777
00:53:14,753 --> 00:53:16,543
..than charges against
seasoned criminals.

778
00:53:17,594 --> 00:53:20,333
Sorry. I can't take the risk.

779
00:53:22,094 --> 00:53:24,023
Wonder where that master's hiding?

780
00:53:24,563 --> 00:53:26,543
He'll have to come out someday.

781
00:53:30,673 --> 00:53:31,724
They're nowhere.

782
00:53:33,684 --> 00:53:35,664
We searched the entire village.

783
00:53:36,393 --> 00:53:39,163
We couldn't find the master,
or his men.

784
00:53:40,253 --> 00:53:43,373
I think the chairman's
hiding them in his mansion.

785
00:53:43,733 --> 00:53:46,713
That's why he's turned
his mansion into a fortress.

786
00:53:54,023 --> 00:53:56,623
I've great news for you.

787
00:54:00,023 --> 00:54:01,804
Karamveer's coming tomorrow.

788
00:54:23,634 --> 00:54:24,494
Papa's back!

789
00:54:24,614 --> 00:54:25,634
Papa's back!

790
00:54:25,804 --> 00:54:26,804
Papa!

791
00:54:28,313 --> 00:54:29,373
Where's Karamveer?

792
00:54:29,594 --> 00:54:30,733
Fauji's abducted him.

793
00:54:56,253 --> 00:54:58,103
Brother, you won't go alone.

794
00:54:58,534 --> 00:55:00,963
We won't spare Fauji today.

795
00:55:01,143 --> 00:55:02,143
No one will do anything.

796
00:55:03,914 --> 00:55:07,164
I will go alone,
and bring brother back.

797
00:55:09,574 --> 00:55:11,974
Uncle, why didn't papa come?

798
00:55:15,554 --> 00:55:17,153
Master, chairman sir..

799
00:55:17,304 --> 00:55:19,354
..has strictly asked
me not to leave you alone.

800
00:55:20,143 --> 00:55:21,993
What can he do? Kill me?

801
00:55:23,253 --> 00:55:24,253
Let him.

802
00:55:24,844 --> 00:55:26,813
I will fall at his feet.

803
00:55:27,184 --> 00:55:28,374
Take his bullet.

804
00:55:28,983 --> 00:55:29,983
He's my brother.

805
00:55:30,364 --> 00:55:31,543
If anything happens to him..

806
00:55:32,114 --> 00:55:35,173
..I will never forgive myself.
- Fine, Master.

807
00:55:35,664 --> 00:55:36,874
But take this along.

808
00:55:37,224 --> 00:55:39,844
I'm going to bring my brother back,
not fight!

809
00:55:42,543 --> 00:55:44,473
No, brother.
Keep it, for our satisfaction.

810
00:55:52,284 --> 00:55:54,804
Bhura. Get the car. - Yes, brother.

811
00:56:03,434 --> 00:56:05,454
Corporal sir's sitting here.
Attention!

812
00:56:05,724 --> 00:56:07,264
Salutations!

813
00:56:08,373 --> 00:56:10,263
Don't mess my mind, Fauji.

814
00:56:11,373 --> 00:56:13,023
And what's this
matter about Satbeer?

815
00:56:14,253 --> 00:56:15,313
Why are you after him?

816
00:56:17,034 --> 00:56:18,574
He's no woman to go after.

817
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:22,763
He's trying to act smart.

818
00:56:23,563 --> 00:56:25,114
If he doesn't come quietly..

819
00:56:25,414 --> 00:56:27,484
..then I'll fill
his body with bullets.

820
00:56:28,034 --> 00:56:29,753
His sons will be born of brass.

821
00:56:36,083 --> 00:56:37,493
You will kill him?

822
00:56:37,713 --> 00:56:39,543
Do you doubt my ability?

823
00:56:51,864 --> 00:56:53,213
So tell me,
which leg should I shoot?

824
00:56:54,164 --> 00:56:55,384
Left? Right?

825
00:56:55,773 --> 00:56:56,893
Left? Right?

826
00:56:57,884 --> 00:56:58,443
Left!

827
00:56:58,543 --> 00:57:00,333
I want this leg, Thakur.

828
00:57:05,603 --> 00:57:06,523
Doubting me.

829
00:57:06,643 --> 00:57:07,643
Rascal!

830
00:57:12,643 --> 00:57:13,643
Fauji!

831
00:57:16,903 --> 00:57:19,244
There's such brotherly
love between you two.

832
00:57:19,824 --> 00:57:22,074
Had I known, I would've
written him a threat letter.

833
00:57:27,014 --> 00:57:30,044
Look Fauji, your fight with me.

834
00:57:31,523 --> 00:57:32,523
I'm right here.

835
00:57:32,724 --> 00:57:34,193
Do anything you like.
Kill me.

836
00:57:36,693 --> 00:57:37,824
Let my brother go.

837
00:57:40,583 --> 00:57:42,433
Master, you're late.

838
00:57:45,934 --> 00:57:50,224
Don't worry. Your brother's alive.

839
00:57:50,963 --> 00:57:51,963
Go on, Corporal.

840
00:57:52,264 --> 00:57:53,334
Meet your brother.

841
00:57:56,434 --> 00:57:57,434
Is it paining?

842
00:58:02,914 --> 00:58:03,914
Brother.

843
00:58:06,494 --> 00:58:07,494
Satbeer.

844
00:58:09,273 --> 00:58:10,763
I've changed my mood.

845
00:58:15,224 --> 00:58:16,224
Fauji!

846
00:58:44,884 --> 00:58:45,994
Come on. - Hurry up!

847
00:59:55,963 --> 01:00:03,543
"Patience has crossed.."

848
01:00:05,583 --> 01:00:09,134
"Patience has crossed all limits."

849
01:00:09,364 --> 01:00:11,733
"He's forsaken the pen and paper."

850
01:00:11,914 --> 01:00:17,153
"And now he'll let
his fist do the talking."

851
01:00:17,443 --> 01:00:22,943
"Even if the snakes
are hiding in their burrow."

852
01:00:23,753 --> 01:00:24,873
"Enemies tremble."

853
01:00:25,003 --> 01:00:26,163
"Their breath shivers."

854
01:00:26,293 --> 01:00:29,304
"They beg for their lives."

855
01:00:40,204 --> 01:00:45,764
"Forsaking studies,
he's out to wage war."

856
01:00:48,043 --> 01:00:52,393
"Forsaking studies,
he's out to wage war."

857
01:00:52,784 --> 01:00:57,084
"Roars, snarls.."

858
01:00:57,914 --> 01:01:02,724
"Roars, snarls,
but can't be over-powered."

859
01:01:03,003 --> 01:01:05,243
"The lion's out of the cage."

860
01:01:05,474 --> 01:01:08,004
"Now listen to him roar."

861
01:03:48,204 --> 01:03:50,054
Your brother will
never speak again.

862
01:03:52,054 --> 01:03:54,864
I killed him brutally!

863
01:03:56,813 --> 01:03:58,743
Start counting, Fauji.

864
01:03:59,753 --> 01:04:02,973
Satbeer's coming
to settle the scores.

865
01:04:57,744 --> 01:04:58,794
Forgive me.

866
01:05:00,853 --> 01:05:02,634
They attacked suddenly, and I..

867
01:05:05,643 --> 01:05:06,863
I couldn't do anything.

868
01:05:08,463 --> 01:05:10,023
I want Rahat's death avenged.

869
01:05:12,643 --> 01:05:14,333
And don't show me your face..

870
01:05:14,483 --> 01:05:16,094
..until you don't kill that master!

871
01:05:18,393 --> 01:05:19,583
Useless bums!

872
01:06:14,684 --> 01:06:18,314
More than 20 have
been reported dead..

873
01:06:18,543 --> 01:06:23,653
..in the recent gang
war between Fauji and Satbeer.

874
01:06:24,043 --> 01:06:26,094
But the most regrettable
incident is..

875
01:06:26,253 --> 01:06:28,953
..that the police
have completely failed..

876
01:06:29,143 --> 01:06:31,383
..in stopping this gang war.

877
01:06:31,923 --> 01:06:33,233
It's also believed that..

878
01:06:33,373 --> 01:06:35,423
..Satbeer's got Brahmpal
Chairman's backing..

879
01:06:35,634 --> 01:06:39,264
..and Fauji's got
Rashid Ali's backing..

880
01:06:39,824 --> 01:06:42,624
..due to which,
people are also calling this..

881
01:06:42,813 --> 01:06:47,303
..a political war between
the two age-old rivals.

882
01:06:47,684 --> 01:06:49,864
Seeing the police's helplessness..

883
01:06:50,034 --> 01:06:53,864
..people are completely
losing hope in the administration.

884
01:06:54,373 --> 01:06:55,913
Will this gang war stop?

885
01:06:56,244 --> 01:06:58,653
Is there anyone to save this city?

886
01:07:00,353 --> 01:07:01,873
Sir, no one can handle this case..

887
01:07:02,014 --> 01:07:03,784
..other than Thakur Pritam Singh.

888
01:07:10,574 --> 01:07:11,713
Think again.

889
01:07:12,094 --> 01:07:14,034
Sir, we don't have an option.

890
01:07:14,704 --> 01:07:17,074
That inspector can alone
spread as much chaos..

891
01:07:18,014 --> 01:07:20,354
..as these two have.

892
01:07:22,264 --> 01:07:24,534
Don't complain later.
- I won't sir.

893
01:07:25,443 --> 01:07:27,023
Thakur Pritam Singh.

894
01:08:04,643 --> 01:08:11,243
"Makes you run for your life."

895
01:08:12,304 --> 01:08:14,844
"The hunter makes
you run for your life."

896
01:08:15,083 --> 01:08:17,943
"So run...run for your life."

897
01:08:18,144 --> 01:08:21,474
"Run, I want no splatter
of blood on my uniform."

898
01:08:21,694 --> 01:08:23,954
"Standing tall.."

899
01:08:24,953 --> 01:08:27,283
"Broad chest."

900
01:08:27,993 --> 01:08:30,233
"Standing tall,
with a broad chest."

901
01:08:30,493 --> 01:08:32,823
"Fists like hammers."

902
01:08:33,003 --> 01:08:35,373
"The face swells up,
you've no clue."

903
01:08:35,554 --> 01:08:37,913
"And you pee in your pants."

904
01:08:38,094 --> 01:08:42,764
"I roar, I snarl,
but can't be over-powered."

905
01:08:43,043 --> 01:08:47,894
"I come first,
the rest come later."

906
01:08:48,173 --> 01:08:52,903
"This is district Ghaziabad."

907
01:08:53,224 --> 01:08:57,923
"This is district Ghaziabad."

908
01:08:58,243 --> 01:09:02,993
"This is district Ghaziabad."

909
01:09:03,333 --> 01:09:07,963
"This is district Ghaziabad."

910
01:09:14,453 --> 01:09:16,813
I want Rashid and
Chairman's files on my desk.

911
01:09:17,094 --> 01:09:18,094
Yes, sir.

912
01:09:45,094 --> 01:09:50,793
'By hook or by crook,
I've led to the downfall of many.'

913
01:09:52,203 --> 01:09:55,113
'But there's a strange
heat in the air here.'

914
01:09:55,944 --> 01:09:57,764
'So, forget the old tricks.'

915
01:09:58,564 --> 01:10:00,684
'It's time to rack
my brains again.'

916
01:10:01,844 --> 01:10:03,833
'History showed
record of just one..'

917
01:10:04,423 --> 01:10:06,064
'..but here, you're fighting
against two Ravans.'

918
01:10:06,894 --> 01:10:10,114
'There are just two players
in this city's underworld.

919
01:10:11,594 --> 01:10:13,814
One's going through a bad phase while
the other's running into bad luck.

920
01:10:15,283 --> 01:10:18,483
'They say, life and death
are a game of hide and seek.'

921
01:10:19,713 --> 01:10:21,653
'But, when Pritam
Singh gets in the game..'

922
01:10:22,323 --> 01:10:23,783
'..everyone else fails.'

923
01:11:12,814 --> 01:11:14,934
That's it,
now it's beyond tolerance.

924
01:11:16,583 --> 01:11:20,014
Fauji. We'll have to
bring that swine down..

925
01:11:21,373 --> 01:11:23,224
..before he harms us anymore.

926
01:11:34,654 --> 01:11:35,694
Thank you.

927
01:11:36,413 --> 01:11:37,733
Here. - Rs. 1000!

928
01:11:38,014 --> 01:11:39,194
Bless you!

929
01:11:39,373 --> 01:11:41,783
Aunt! Here you go.
- Bless you, son.

930
01:11:42,083 --> 01:11:43,724
May you live for a 1000 years.

931
01:11:44,963 --> 01:11:46,953
Hey, buddy.. you don't want money.

932
01:12:33,543 --> 01:12:35,123
The murder of Brahmpal Chaudhary..

933
01:12:35,274 --> 01:12:37,354
..has created a
pandemonium in Ghaziabad!

934
01:12:37,524 --> 01:12:39,124
The supporters of
Chairman Brahmpal..

935
01:12:39,274 --> 01:12:41,173
..created a disturbance
in the entire city.

936
01:12:41,333 --> 01:12:44,014
In many places, the police
had to resort to tear gas..

937
01:12:44,203 --> 01:12:45,373
..to quell the mob.

938
01:12:45,684 --> 01:12:47,204
The people are also angry about..

939
01:12:47,344 --> 01:12:49,833
..the fact that the person
accused for murder, Fauji..

940
01:12:50,104 --> 01:12:51,264
..has still not be arrested.

941
01:12:51,484 --> 01:12:53,874
This murder is expected to fuel..

942
01:12:54,104 --> 01:12:56,454
..the already on-going
gang war in Ghaziabad.

943
01:12:56,854 --> 01:12:58,284
Because, Brahmpal supporters..

944
01:12:58,423 --> 01:13:01,934
..Satbeer gang can go to
any limit to avenge this murder.

945
01:13:02,363 --> 01:13:03,983
This murder incident,
that took place..

946
01:13:04,134 --> 01:13:06,793
..after the new in-charge
Pritam Singh took charge..

947
01:13:07,043 --> 01:13:09,163
..has raised questions
on the police's line of action.

948
01:13:09,413 --> 01:13:10,743
And it looks like the police..

949
01:13:10,884 --> 01:13:12,764
..have already accepted defeat.

950
01:13:13,234 --> 01:13:17,394
Can anyone stop this
war for absolute dominance?

951
01:14:20,243 --> 01:14:24,313
"Come dwell in my eyes."

952
01:14:24,564 --> 01:14:28,954
"We'll talk with our eyes."

953
01:14:37,283 --> 01:14:41,384
"Come dwell in my eyes."

954
01:14:41,634 --> 01:14:45,894
"We'll talk with our eyes."

955
01:14:46,543 --> 01:14:50,463
"All the beautiful moments
were in your company."

956
01:14:50,804 --> 01:14:54,634
"All the beautiful moments
were in your company."

957
01:14:55,033 --> 01:14:58,094
"My heart feels lively again."

958
01:14:58,594 --> 01:15:01,394
"You're my God."

959
01:15:02,743 --> 01:15:06,293
"God knows."

960
01:15:07,144 --> 01:15:11,114
"You're my God, God knows.."

961
01:15:11,404 --> 01:15:15,354
"You mean everything to me,
God knows."

962
01:15:15,774 --> 01:15:19,704
"You're my God."

963
01:15:41,283 --> 01:15:44,813
"You're my temple."

964
01:15:45,423 --> 01:15:49,014
"You're my prayers."

965
01:15:49,673 --> 01:15:53,253
"You're my mosque."

966
01:15:53,923 --> 01:15:57,903
"You're my devotion."

967
01:15:58,253 --> 01:16:02,193
"I am no God, I am just human."

968
01:16:02,604 --> 01:16:07,154
"I am your companion,
partner and benefactor."

969
01:16:07,423 --> 01:16:11,444
"All the beautiful moments
were in your company."

970
01:16:11,734 --> 01:16:15,494
"All the beautiful moments
were in your company."

971
01:16:15,993 --> 01:16:19,183
"My heart feels lively again."

972
01:16:19,543 --> 01:16:22,623
"You're my God."

973
01:16:23,743 --> 01:16:27,253
"God knows."

974
01:16:28,024 --> 01:16:31,934
"You're my God, God knows.."

975
01:16:32,253 --> 01:16:36,304
"You mean everything to me,
God knows."

976
01:16:36,644 --> 01:16:40,444
"You're my God."

977
01:16:42,863 --> 01:16:46,253
"God knows."

978
01:16:49,194 --> 01:16:53,284
"You're my God, God knows.."

979
01:16:53,594 --> 01:16:57,524
"You mean everything to me,
God knows."

980
01:16:57,764 --> 01:17:01,854
"You're my God."

981
01:17:03,134 --> 01:17:04,264
Sir...sir..

982
01:17:04,394 --> 01:17:07,503
Satbeer gang's
shedding blood openly.

983
01:17:07,774 --> 01:17:09,164
What are the police doing?

984
01:17:12,493 --> 01:17:15,193
Look. We've recommended
the administration..

985
01:17:15,384 --> 01:17:17,953
..to levy a reward of one
million on Fauji and Satbeer.

986
01:17:18,344 --> 01:17:20,913
We hope we'll apprehend them soon.

987
01:17:21,243 --> 01:17:22,793
Sir, why hasn't your department..

988
01:17:22,944 --> 01:17:25,834
..succeeded in apprehending
the chairman's murderers?

989
01:17:26,104 --> 01:17:27,444
Why don't you tell us?

990
01:17:27,904 --> 01:17:29,294
Tell us. - No, sir.

991
01:17:29,434 --> 01:17:30,954
Tell us. - No, sir.

992
01:17:32,573 --> 01:17:33,433
No comments.

993
01:17:33,554 --> 01:17:34,884
Sir...sir..
One more question.

994
01:17:35,253 --> 01:17:36,814
Sir..
Move back. Back!

995
01:18:01,113 --> 01:18:02,134
Asking me for money.

996
01:18:03,554 --> 01:18:04,894
Beat him! Beat him!

997
01:18:05,064 --> 01:18:06,734
Don't beat me.

998
01:18:07,003 --> 01:18:09,533
You dare ask me for money?
- Don't beat me.

999
01:18:13,033 --> 01:18:13,753
Don't beat me.

1000
01:18:13,873 --> 01:18:15,623
How dare you ask me money,
vile man!

1001
01:18:15,783 --> 01:18:17,733
Me!
How dare you?

1002
01:18:17,894 --> 01:18:18,793
Take that!

1003
01:18:18,913 --> 01:18:20,293
Take that!

1004
01:18:21,934 --> 01:18:22,974
What's going on here?

1005
01:18:25,904 --> 01:18:27,274
What happened? - Nothing, sir.

1006
01:18:27,533 --> 01:18:28,554
Don't worry, speak up.

1007
01:18:28,734 --> 01:18:30,724
They eat here on credit every day.

1008
01:18:31,194 --> 01:18:32,824
Their credit was long overdue.

1009
01:18:33,113 --> 01:18:37,103
I asked them to pay up,
but they beat me instead.

1010
01:18:37,354 --> 01:18:39,064
I am advocate Pammi Bajaj.

1011
01:18:43,333 --> 01:18:44,823
This isn't right, Inspector.

1012
01:18:46,394 --> 01:18:48,664
You'll have to answer in the court,
Inspector!

1013
01:19:00,304 --> 01:19:01,033
Here's the gun.

1014
01:19:01,144 --> 01:19:02,264
Shoot him! - No, sir.

1015
01:19:02,654 --> 01:19:04,824
Either you shoot him,
or he shoots you.

1016
01:19:05,743 --> 01:19:08,253
Inspector, what are you doing?
Lower the gun, it might fire.

1017
01:19:08,474 --> 01:19:09,634
Lower it. - Shoot him!

1018
01:19:09,764 --> 01:19:11,394
Lower it. - Shoot!

1019
01:19:12,724 --> 01:19:14,864
'Pritam Singh never tolerates..'

1020
01:19:15,634 --> 01:19:20,814
'..unlawful men or illegal
business in his city.'

1021
01:19:22,194 --> 01:19:25,634
'The city will have
to bear that much.'

1022
01:19:26,073 --> 01:19:26,793
Catch them!

1023
01:19:26,904 --> 01:19:28,234
Where did the cops come from?

1024
01:19:28,573 --> 01:19:29,763
Come on! Run!

1025
01:19:32,283 --> 01:19:33,653
Didn't you get
Pritam Singh's order?

1026
01:19:55,104 --> 01:19:56,124
Fine, Shyam Singh.

1027
01:19:59,024 --> 01:20:00,024
There's bad news.

1028
01:20:01,694 --> 01:20:03,744
Pritam Singh's looking for Satbeer.

1029
01:20:04,394 --> 01:20:06,774
He's put up brother's
posters in the entire city.

1030
01:20:07,354 --> 01:20:08,654
So what?

1031
01:20:09,304 --> 01:20:11,234
Let's see what he can do?

1032
01:20:11,463 --> 01:20:13,993
Fool, don't take him lightly.

1033
01:20:14,413 --> 01:20:16,413
He's been in over 107 encounters.

1034
01:20:16,573 --> 01:20:18,503
I've heard he's a madman.

1035
01:20:18,814 --> 01:20:20,314
He shoots before he speaks.

1036
01:20:20,873 --> 01:20:23,233
That's why, he never stays more than
three months in any police station.

1037
01:20:23,413 --> 01:20:24,753
Brother's life is in danger.

1038
01:20:25,073 --> 01:20:26,463
Shall we go underground
for a few days?

1039
01:20:26,604 --> 01:20:28,524
Shut up, everyone.
Let me think.

1040
01:20:51,033 --> 01:20:53,753
That inspector's
threatened to kill us.

1041
01:20:54,734 --> 01:20:56,534
Fauji, you're our only hope now.

1042
01:20:56,694 --> 01:20:58,774
Or else we'll have
to close down business.

1043
01:20:59,184 --> 01:21:00,873
If this continues..

1044
01:21:01,024 --> 01:21:03,274
..then, we'll have
to close down all the bars.

1045
01:21:04,184 --> 01:21:07,234
If he works according to us,
we'll let him live..

1046
01:21:08,373 --> 01:21:09,373
..or else we'll kill him.

1047
01:21:10,363 --> 01:21:11,443
He's a policeman.

1048
01:21:12,054 --> 01:21:13,944
Think twice before you do anything.

1049
01:21:15,033 --> 01:21:17,463
Master was creating enough
trouble in our lives..

1050
01:21:17,644 --> 01:21:19,463
..and now there's this inspector.

1051
01:21:34,823 --> 01:21:36,463
Better arrange
for your final rites.

1052
01:21:41,793 --> 01:21:43,144
He won't do anything here.

1053
01:21:43,283 --> 01:21:44,903
He doesn't have evidence.

1054
01:21:49,684 --> 01:21:50,833
Great.

1055
01:21:51,913 --> 01:21:54,033
All the respected people
of the city have gathered here.

1056
01:21:56,113 --> 01:21:59,343
Rashid, you're here too.

1057
01:22:00,783 --> 01:22:02,973
I don't think you're
too happy to see me.

1058
01:22:03,804 --> 01:22:05,373
I'm like you.

1059
01:22:06,224 --> 01:22:07,484
The only difference is..

1060
01:22:08,113 --> 01:22:11,233
..I wear a uniform, you don't.

1061
01:22:12,944 --> 01:22:15,854
Myself Fakira. Pleased to meet you.

1062
01:22:17,863 --> 01:22:19,753
He's Fauji. Let me introduce you.

1063
01:22:20,264 --> 01:22:22,134
Everyone knows him.

1064
01:22:22,604 --> 01:22:25,074
He has a reward of
one million on him. Fauji.

1065
01:22:26,774 --> 01:22:29,944
He is more popular than
Hrithik Roshan in this district.

1066
01:22:31,304 --> 01:22:32,873
But the only difference is..

1067
01:22:33,774 --> 01:22:35,984
..his posters are put
up in my police station.

1068
01:22:39,554 --> 01:22:42,144
Are you praising me or
humiliating me, Inspector?

1069
01:22:42,333 --> 01:22:44,923
How can I dare to humiliate Fauji?

1070
01:22:47,064 --> 01:22:48,944
Shyam Singh. - Yes, sir.

1071
01:22:49,314 --> 01:22:51,914
Get something to drink.
Arrange for a girl.

1072
01:23:33,394 --> 01:23:35,014
"I am hottie no. 1."

1073
01:23:35,333 --> 01:23:36,713
"I am like an atom bomb."

1074
01:23:37,134 --> 01:23:38,894
"Every time I shake my waist."

1075
01:23:39,054 --> 01:23:40,854
"I am like a bottle of rum."

1076
01:23:41,573 --> 01:23:44,913
"Once I get you high,
you never get over me."

1077
01:23:45,134 --> 01:23:48,404
"Every crazy heart wants a sip."

1078
01:23:48,963 --> 01:23:50,333
"The celebration.."

1079
01:23:50,804 --> 01:23:52,224
"The celebration.."

1080
01:23:52,663 --> 01:23:55,583
"The celebration's incomplete
without hottie no.1."

1081
01:23:56,323 --> 01:23:59,253
"The celebration's incomplete
without hottie no.1."

1082
01:24:00,113 --> 01:24:03,393
"The celebration's incomplete
without hottie no.1."

1083
01:24:03,743 --> 01:24:07,103
"The celebration's incomplete
without hottie no.1."

1084
01:24:07,404 --> 01:24:10,374
"The celebration's incomplete
without hottie no.1."

1085
01:24:29,333 --> 01:24:32,304
"Silver loses it's worth."

1086
01:24:32,844 --> 01:24:36,083
"My body glows like gold."

1087
01:24:36,474 --> 01:24:37,944
"I am an illusion."

1088
01:24:38,253 --> 01:24:39,953
"I am like salt."

1089
01:24:40,184 --> 01:24:43,463
"No spell can work on me."

1090
01:24:44,123 --> 01:24:47,634
"No need to show me those notes."

1091
01:24:47,863 --> 01:24:51,353
"I know your intentions are bad."

1092
01:24:51,644 --> 01:24:55,043
"Once you get someone high,
he never gets over you."

1093
01:24:55,264 --> 01:24:59,163
"Every crazy heart wants a sip."

1094
01:25:00,904 --> 01:25:02,494
"The celebration.."

1095
01:25:02,833 --> 01:25:04,184
"The celebration.."

1096
01:25:04,623 --> 01:25:07,783
"The celebration's incomplete
without hottie no.1."

1097
01:25:08,264 --> 01:25:11,634
"The celebration's incomplete
without hottie no.1."

1098
01:25:11,963 --> 01:25:14,793
"The celebration's incomplete
without hottie no.1."

1099
01:25:14,993 --> 01:25:16,393
"I am hottie no.1"

1100
01:25:16,804 --> 01:25:18,344
"I am like an atom bomb."

1101
01:25:18,623 --> 01:25:20,173
"Every time I shake my waist."

1102
01:25:20,404 --> 01:25:22,834
"I am like a bottle of rum."

1103
01:25:39,514 --> 01:25:42,654
"Every street I pass by."

1104
01:25:43,104 --> 01:25:46,144
"My lovers whistle at me."

1105
01:25:46,533 --> 01:25:49,773
"If you can't get a taste of me."

1106
01:25:50,594 --> 01:25:53,533
"Then you're really bad luck."

1107
01:25:54,264 --> 01:25:57,713
"My silky blouse steals
your peace and sleep."

1108
01:25:57,984 --> 01:26:01,374
"My eyes pierce your
heart like bullets."

1109
01:26:01,793 --> 01:26:05,123
"Once you get someone high,
he never gets over you."

1110
01:26:05,344 --> 01:26:08,804
"Every crazy heart wants a sip."

1111
01:26:12,823 --> 01:26:14,353
"The celebration.."

1112
01:26:14,713 --> 01:26:16,123
"The celebration.."

1113
01:26:16,604 --> 01:26:19,684
"The celebration's incomplete
without hottie no.1."

1114
01:26:20,264 --> 01:26:23,583
"The celebration's incomplete
without hottie no.1."

1115
01:26:23,963 --> 01:26:27,314
"The celebration's incomplete
without hottie no.1."

1116
01:26:27,604 --> 01:26:30,934
"The celebration's incomplete
without hottie no.1."

1117
01:26:32,814 --> 01:26:33,814
Take my advice.

1118
01:26:35,293 --> 01:26:38,064
Surrender, and you'll live.

1119
01:26:38,444 --> 01:26:40,294
I've an advice for you too.

1120
01:26:41,283 --> 01:26:43,683
Take a transfer, and you'll live.

1121
01:26:49,003 --> 01:26:50,804
The real fun begins now.

1122
01:26:51,963 --> 01:26:54,644
No matter how
ferocious the dog is..

1123
01:26:55,094 --> 01:26:56,774
..he can never screw the lion.

1124
01:27:06,623 --> 01:27:07,913
Pass me the lighter.

1125
01:27:10,283 --> 01:27:11,693
Where's it?

1126
01:27:11,844 --> 01:27:14,083
I don't get one thing.

1127
01:27:14,974 --> 01:27:20,543
Here.
- When sir had the drop on Fauji..

1128
01:27:20,904 --> 01:27:23,124
..why didn't he just shoot him?

1129
01:27:24,073 --> 01:27:27,363
His name is Pritam Singh.

1130
01:27:29,484 --> 01:27:31,404
The harder you try
to understand him..

1131
01:27:31,564 --> 01:27:32,963
..the more confused you'll be.

1132
01:27:33,184 --> 01:27:35,104
Haven't you heard that saying?

1133
01:27:35,543 --> 01:27:39,443
Ancestors were hunters,
and Pritam Singh's a step ahead.

1134
01:27:42,434 --> 01:27:44,623
Their number's not up yet.

1135
01:27:45,684 --> 01:27:48,423
Pritam Singh will trouble them.

1136
01:27:48,913 --> 01:27:50,273
Make them restless.

1137
01:27:50,594 --> 01:27:52,184
Make them run.

1138
01:27:52,453 --> 01:27:53,703
And, when he's fed-up.

1139
01:27:54,234 --> 01:27:58,894
When he's fed-up, he'll bullet a
bullet in Fauji and Satbeer's head.

1140
01:28:00,524 --> 01:28:01,514
Delta 1. Delta 1.

1141
01:28:01,634 --> 01:28:03,194
Half an hour ago,
few unidentified people..

1142
01:28:03,344 --> 01:28:05,573
..have abducted the owner
of Mayur Gutka (tobacco) Rastogi..

1143
01:28:05,753 --> 01:28:06,774
..from Navyug Market.

1144
01:28:06,894 --> 01:28:08,043
They're fleeing
in a white Zen car..

1145
01:28:08,173 --> 01:28:09,953
..which has been spotted heading
towards Ghanta Ghar.

1146
01:28:10,144 --> 01:28:12,204
Contact all PCR's,
those are the captain's orders.

1147
01:28:12,373 --> 01:28:14,073
Message received.

1148
01:28:16,963 --> 01:28:18,403
That rascal inspector.

1149
01:28:18,644 --> 01:28:20,003
He's brewing trouble for us.

1150
01:28:20,634 --> 01:28:22,264
He's surrounding us from all sides.

1151
01:28:22,413 --> 01:28:25,123
I feel, soon he'll
have his hands on me.

1152
01:28:26,493 --> 01:28:28,143
Take my advice, do something big.

1153
01:28:28,654 --> 01:28:30,014
Elections are round the corner.

1154
01:28:30,713 --> 01:28:31,863
Run for the MLA elections.

1155
01:28:32,094 --> 01:28:33,264
You didn't get it.

1156
01:28:33,804 --> 01:28:35,394
Anyone can be a chairman.

1157
01:28:36,814 --> 01:28:37,814
I can be one.

1158
01:28:40,163 --> 01:28:41,603
You'll certainly win.

1159
01:28:42,923 --> 01:28:44,764
And once you do,
you'll be a minister.

1160
01:28:45,413 --> 01:28:48,184
And that inspector will
open the door to your car himself.

1161
01:28:49,783 --> 01:28:51,054
And say, "Good morning."

1162
01:28:53,953 --> 01:28:54,953
Do it.

1163
01:28:58,104 --> 01:28:59,104
You're smart!

1164
01:29:03,594 --> 01:29:05,663
Look, I don't like to twist words.

1165
01:29:07,094 --> 01:29:10,484
I wish to contest the
MLA election from Ghaziabad.

1166
01:29:11,144 --> 01:29:12,304
I just need your support.

1167
01:29:14,953 --> 01:29:16,623
You're too late, Rashid.

1168
01:29:17,974 --> 01:29:20,043
I've already made a
commitment to someone else.

1169
01:29:20,823 --> 01:29:22,223
Not even if I say it?

1170
01:29:24,154 --> 01:29:25,634
No one in Ghaziabad..

1171
01:29:26,293 --> 01:29:30,673
..has the guts to turn Fauji down.

1172
01:29:31,944 --> 01:29:35,644
And, you're one of us.

1173
01:29:38,413 --> 01:29:39,673
I'm not Salman Khan..

1174
01:29:39,804 --> 01:29:41,594
..who cannot go back
on his commitments.

1175
01:29:43,243 --> 01:29:44,243
But..

1176
01:29:47,173 --> 01:29:51,094
To go back, there should
be something to look forward to.

1177
01:29:51,394 --> 01:29:52,394
Right?

1178
01:29:57,594 --> 01:29:58,594
Fine.

1179
01:29:59,123 --> 01:30:00,603
Once I win the elections..

1180
01:30:01,213 --> 01:30:03,554
..we'll together run
the government contracts.

1181
01:30:03,844 --> 01:30:04,844
That's more like it.

1182
01:30:05,634 --> 01:30:07,274
Then Sangham Singh's with you.

1183
01:30:07,774 --> 01:30:08,774
Congrats!

1184
01:30:10,434 --> 01:30:11,434
Happy?

1185
01:30:12,623 --> 01:30:13,903
And the district chairman?

1186
01:30:19,234 --> 01:30:20,994
The nominee for the
chairman's election..

1187
01:30:21,503 --> 01:30:22,543
..will be...Fakira!

1188
01:30:23,323 --> 01:30:26,263
Fakira. You're going
to be the chairman.

1189
01:30:42,363 --> 01:30:43,363
Sir.

1190
01:30:44,634 --> 01:30:45,634
Sir.

1191
01:30:46,253 --> 01:30:48,993
You were simply great.

1192
01:30:50,724 --> 01:30:52,333
You made Rashid's
plight really bad..

1193
01:30:52,484 --> 01:30:54,144
..without firing a single bullet.

1194
01:30:54,434 --> 01:30:57,644
And half of his men fled down.

1195
01:30:57,894 --> 01:31:00,014
You're great, sir.
- Wow!

1196
01:31:01,634 --> 01:31:03,394
That's a good score. - Yes.

1197
01:31:03,753 --> 01:31:04,753
Answer the phone.

1198
01:31:09,613 --> 01:31:10,413
Hello.

1199
01:31:10,533 --> 01:31:11,733
Hello, Mr. Thakur.

1200
01:31:12,644 --> 01:31:14,144
Thinking about Satbeer?

1201
01:31:15,484 --> 01:31:17,114
I heard that you're looking for me.

1202
01:31:18,064 --> 01:31:20,374
I think about Madhuri as well.

1203
01:31:20,844 --> 01:31:22,054
But I never find her.

1204
01:31:24,993 --> 01:31:28,933
I wanted to meet you.
- Okay, tell me where.

1205
01:31:29,533 --> 01:31:31,263
Will you come where I call you?

1206
01:31:31,463 --> 01:31:33,333
Just name the place. - I see.

1207
01:31:34,724 --> 01:31:35,814
Fine, come down
to the police station.

1208
01:31:37,123 --> 01:31:38,123
I'm on my way!

1209
01:31:41,503 --> 01:31:42,663
What do I say, sir?

1210
01:31:43,024 --> 01:31:46,184
That Khalnayak movie spoiled
all the boys of this city.

1211
01:31:46,404 --> 01:31:48,144
They were teasing the
girls outside the college.

1212
01:31:48,304 --> 01:31:50,654
Sir, good-looking heroes
aren't much popular here.

1213
01:31:51,354 --> 01:31:52,724
These poor boys
don't have a choice.

1214
01:31:52,934 --> 01:31:54,704
They're trying to
look like Sanjay Dutt.

1215
01:31:55,014 --> 01:31:57,003
Shave their head!

1216
01:31:57,003 --> 01:31:58,243
Sir, let us go. - Don't do it.

1217
01:31:58,373 --> 01:32:00,054
Sir, my father's
an income-tax officer.

1218
01:32:00,213 --> 01:32:01,213
I see.

1219
01:32:01,804 --> 01:32:03,243
But I never take bribe.

1220
01:32:03,793 --> 01:32:04,713
Shave it off.

1221
01:32:04,833 --> 01:32:06,673
Sir, forgive us. - Sir, please.

1222
01:32:06,833 --> 01:32:07,974
Very good, sir.
Very good.

1223
01:32:08,554 --> 01:32:09,684
Your food's served, sir.

1224
01:32:12,734 --> 01:32:14,314
If Sanjay Dutt had been here..

1225
01:32:14,894 --> 01:32:16,704
..I would've shaved his hair too.

1226
01:32:17,184 --> 01:32:19,574
This is Ghaziabad, not Mumbai.

1227
01:32:20,373 --> 01:32:21,193
Shave their heads!

1228
01:32:21,304 --> 01:32:23,033
You're right, sir, but..
- Listen, sir..

1229
01:32:23,194 --> 01:32:25,104
Please, sir. - Please..

1230
01:32:34,234 --> 01:32:35,234
Satbeer!

1231
01:33:16,944 --> 01:33:18,004
I'll take it back when I leave.

1232
01:33:19,423 --> 01:33:20,423
Pritam Singh?

1233
01:33:29,764 --> 01:33:30,944
Hello, Mr. Thakur.

1234
01:33:31,503 --> 01:33:32,394
Satbeer.

1235
01:33:32,514 --> 01:33:33,934
I've heard your name.
Come, sit.

1236
01:33:40,293 --> 01:33:41,894
I'm not that popular yet.

1237
01:33:42,543 --> 01:33:44,023
There's a reward of
one million on your head.

1238
01:33:47,444 --> 01:33:49,364
What if I kill you now?

1239
01:33:51,243 --> 01:33:53,953
I've heard that Thakur's
are men of honour.

1240
01:33:54,654 --> 01:33:55,634
Hey.
- Yes.

1241
01:33:55,753 --> 01:33:57,104
Get tea for us. - Yes, sir.

1242
01:34:03,003 --> 01:34:07,104
You're daring. - I'm sure
you didn't call me for just that.

1243
01:34:11,793 --> 01:34:12,793
Thank you.

1244
01:34:24,283 --> 01:34:25,283
I want Fauji.

1245
01:34:30,554 --> 01:34:31,623
I want him too.

1246
01:34:32,493 --> 01:34:34,143
But, how can I help you?

1247
01:34:36,894 --> 01:34:38,264
You must have heard.

1248
01:34:39,894 --> 01:34:41,644
Birds of a feather flock together.

1249
01:34:43,863 --> 01:34:45,423
You both are same.

1250
01:34:45,783 --> 01:34:47,523
Then you must have offered
this deal to Fauji as well.

1251
01:34:49,923 --> 01:34:52,514
So? What went wrong?

1252
01:34:54,003 --> 01:34:56,253
I've done enough R&D on you two.

1253
01:34:57,304 --> 01:34:58,493
There's something about you.

1254
01:35:02,234 --> 01:35:05,914
When two hunters join hands,
the hunt becomes interesting.

1255
01:35:08,283 --> 01:35:09,413
It's like this, Mr. Thakur.

1256
01:35:10,793 --> 01:35:12,083
There's a saying in my village.

1257
01:35:14,234 --> 01:35:17,644
It's not advisable to make
friends or enemies with the police.

1258
01:35:19,314 --> 01:35:20,713
Can't say about enmity..

1259
01:35:21,634 --> 01:35:25,024
..but, only a chosen few
get to be Pritam Singh's friend.

1260
01:35:30,224 --> 01:35:31,224
Come on.

1261
01:35:31,654 --> 01:35:33,994
I'll give you a token
of our first meeting.

1262
01:35:40,764 --> 01:35:41,844
What's this?

1263
01:35:44,194 --> 01:35:45,024
Lakkadpal.

1264
01:35:45,144 --> 01:35:46,724
What happened now?
- Saved.

1265
01:35:46,873 --> 01:35:48,434
What happened, Fauji?

1266
01:35:48,984 --> 01:35:50,934
I haven't heard
a gunshot in two days.

1267
01:35:51,404 --> 01:35:52,404
I can't sleep.

1268
01:35:54,944 --> 01:35:55,944
Who killed him?

1269
01:36:45,894 --> 01:36:46,673
Rascal.

1270
01:36:46,783 --> 01:36:47,603
Let's get out of here.

1271
01:36:47,724 --> 01:36:49,534
He joined hands with police.

1272
01:36:56,944 --> 01:36:57,944
Look.

1273
01:36:59,083 --> 01:37:02,313
Let's see how long can Fauji run?

1274
01:37:11,583 --> 01:37:12,583
I knew it.

1275
01:37:13,413 --> 01:37:17,903
I knew Pritam Singh would
rescue him, and he did.

1276
01:37:19,764 --> 01:37:22,534
Fauji. So?

1277
01:37:23,104 --> 01:37:24,774
No more guts. Poof!

1278
01:37:26,253 --> 01:37:28,953
He took Rastogi! Didn't he?

1279
01:37:30,604 --> 01:37:32,444
I suggest that you take retirement.

1280
01:37:32,594 --> 01:37:33,993
Get out of here. Go!

1281
01:37:34,134 --> 01:37:35,194
You've become a burden.

1282
01:37:36,104 --> 01:37:37,844
I asked you to keep
him in the farmhouse..

1283
01:37:38,293 --> 01:37:39,453
..but you were scared-stiff.

1284
01:37:39,743 --> 01:37:41,643
Four of my men were killed.
- Get lost!

1285
01:37:42,354 --> 01:37:43,354
Fauji! Fauji!

1286
01:37:43,604 --> 01:37:45,003
Tell him to speak to me..

1287
01:37:45,144 --> 01:37:46,514
Tell him to speak to me..

1288
01:37:46,724 --> 01:37:47,724
Come on!

1289
01:37:49,344 --> 01:37:50,423
He's gone mad!

1290
01:37:51,253 --> 01:37:52,423
He's lost his mind!

1291
01:37:53,064 --> 01:37:56,003
Pritam Singh knew
where my hideout is.

1292
01:37:56,613 --> 01:37:58,153
If he had conducted a raid..

1293
01:37:58,533 --> 01:38:02,363
..then I could've never fought
the elections in Ghaziabad..

1294
01:38:03,844 --> 01:38:04,844
Rashid.

1295
01:38:06,453 --> 01:38:07,833
Don't make things worse.

1296
01:38:08,854 --> 01:38:10,444
We need this brute.

1297
01:38:12,993 --> 01:38:16,033
You need to make friends,
not enemies.

1298
01:38:16,404 --> 01:38:17,774
Elections are round the corner.

1299
01:38:17,993 --> 01:38:20,193
Just focus on the nominations,
that's all.

1300
01:38:21,703 --> 01:38:23,873
We'll handle Pritam Singh later.

1301
01:38:33,613 --> 01:38:34,663
Narender. - Yes, sir

1302
01:38:34,863 --> 01:38:37,393
File an FIR against
Rashid and Fauji..

1303
01:38:39,243 --> 01:38:40,223
Behalf of Rastogi.

1304
01:38:40,344 --> 01:38:42,514
Sir. Let the FIR be.

1305
01:38:43,154 --> 01:38:44,794
Don't drag me in this mess.

1306
01:38:45,844 --> 01:38:47,844
It'll anger Fauji.

1307
01:38:51,554 --> 01:38:55,703
If you don't lodge an FIR,
then it'll make me angry.

1308
01:38:57,154 --> 01:38:59,724
And you can even lose your life.

1309
01:39:02,793 --> 01:39:05,173
And, the report won't be
lodged in any police station.

1310
01:39:06,863 --> 01:39:07,863
Get that.

1311
01:39:08,104 --> 01:39:09,304
That's unfair.

1312
01:39:22,804 --> 01:39:24,264
He wouldn't utter a word.

1313
01:39:26,014 --> 01:39:28,713
But now,
the rascal speaks in a high-tone.

1314
01:39:37,033 --> 01:39:40,223
Why do I come to you
whenever I'm worried?

1315
01:39:42,663 --> 01:39:44,733
Why do I find peace
only when I'm with you?

1316
01:39:50,394 --> 01:39:52,954
Because you love me.

1317
01:40:13,444 --> 01:40:14,444
Hello. - Hello.

1318
01:40:15,524 --> 01:40:17,024
Greetings, uncle.
- Bless you, dear.

1319
01:40:17,474 --> 01:40:19,054
I'll have lunch with you today.
- Of course.

1320
01:40:25,394 --> 01:40:27,024
If Rashid wins the elections..

1321
01:40:30,654 --> 01:40:33,924
..then Rashid and
Fauji will grow stronger.

1322
01:40:38,974 --> 01:40:42,394
So, Mahaveer sir,
what should be done?

1323
01:40:45,434 --> 01:40:48,324
We'll need a candidate
of our own against Rashid.

1324
01:40:51,884 --> 01:40:53,724
But, where will we find
a strong candidate like that?

1325
01:40:58,793 --> 01:41:00,264
Lunch is served, please come.

1326
01:41:00,493 --> 01:41:01,493
Come.

1327
01:41:05,363 --> 01:41:06,363
Satbeer. - Yes.

1328
01:41:07,264 --> 01:41:09,114
There's a candidate
in my view? - Who?

1329
01:41:09,604 --> 01:41:10,604
Suman.

1330
01:41:11,083 --> 01:41:12,083
No.

1331
01:41:12,213 --> 01:41:14,203
Come on, the food will get cold.

1332
01:41:14,764 --> 01:41:15,793
You are too.
- Come.

1333
01:41:17,134 --> 01:41:18,293
Satbeer. - Yes.

1334
01:41:18,974 --> 01:41:20,873
Don't say no, think about it once.

1335
01:41:22,163 --> 01:41:25,373
If you do as I say,
we'll certainly win.

1336
01:41:26,484 --> 01:41:27,694
Mahaveer sir.

1337
01:41:29,694 --> 01:41:31,464
I don't want to
drag her in this mess.

1338
01:41:32,904 --> 01:41:34,534
We'll need someone else.

1339
01:41:35,564 --> 01:41:36,684
What are you discussing?

1340
01:41:37,934 --> 01:41:38,934
It's nothing.

1341
01:41:39,384 --> 01:41:41,104
We need a candidate
for the upcoming elections.

1342
01:41:42,444 --> 01:41:44,334
So, you suggest someone.

1343
01:41:44,583 --> 01:41:45,963
Brother, pass me the lentil.

1344
01:41:50,234 --> 01:41:51,234
No, brother.

1345
01:41:51,604 --> 01:41:53,874
Don't look at me.
Choose someone else.

1346
01:41:54,484 --> 01:41:55,984
I don't know anything
about politics.

1347
01:41:58,203 --> 01:41:59,203
Can you join hands?

1348
01:42:42,694 --> 01:42:44,054
My brothers and sisters.

1349
01:42:44,594 --> 01:42:47,274
Seeing your love and appreciation..

1350
01:42:47,764 --> 01:42:51,604
..I've filed the nomination form for
the MLA elections from your city.

1351
01:42:53,394 --> 01:42:55,764
Now, it's your duty..

1352
01:42:56,623 --> 01:42:58,493
..to make me
victorious by majority.

1353
01:43:35,094 --> 01:43:36,274
So, Pritam Singh.

1354
01:43:37,123 --> 01:43:38,673
Are you here to congratulate me?

1355
01:43:42,634 --> 01:43:45,673
No. I'm here to arrest you.

1356
01:43:46,764 --> 01:43:47,993
I've your warrant.

1357
01:43:48,413 --> 01:43:50,764
You're making a mistake,
Pritam Singh.

1358
01:43:52,463 --> 01:43:54,403
I'll win the elections in a week.

1359
01:43:54,564 --> 01:43:55,854
Then I'll be a minister..

1360
01:43:55,984 --> 01:43:59,494
..and you'll open the
door of my car for me.

1361
01:43:59,724 --> 01:44:01,003
Rashid!

1362
01:44:01,144 --> 01:44:01,844
Long live!

1363
01:44:01,953 --> 01:44:02,853
Rashid!

1364
01:44:02,974 --> 01:44:03,833
Long live!

1365
01:44:03,953 --> 01:44:05,474
That's a nice thought.

1366
01:44:05,984 --> 01:44:07,344
I will open the door for you.

1367
01:44:08,024 --> 01:44:09,904
But that door to the lockup,
not your car.

1368
01:44:11,054 --> 01:44:14,774
You think you...can
easily arrest me..

1369
01:44:15,194 --> 01:44:18,634
..and take me away
from my own area.

1370
01:44:53,684 --> 01:44:58,673
So? Will you come quietly
or I've to drag you?

1371
01:45:00,033 --> 01:45:04,203
Let's see...how long
can you keep me in jail?

1372
01:45:04,753 --> 01:45:09,963
It's not about how long,
it's about locking you up.

1373
01:45:15,444 --> 01:45:18,874
You're used to travelling
in imported cars..

1374
01:45:20,524 --> 01:45:22,204
..how will you adjust
to these government vehicles?

1375
01:45:25,413 --> 01:45:26,594
Let's walk today.

1376
01:45:29,234 --> 01:45:30,234
Come on.

1377
01:45:56,944 --> 01:45:58,704
Sir, there's an expectation
of a riot. Please come quickly.

1378
01:46:17,264 --> 01:46:18,864
Sign it. - Mr. Sangham.

1379
01:46:19,304 --> 01:46:21,083
These are Rashid Ali's bail papers.

1380
01:46:21,783 --> 01:46:22,813
I've read them.

1381
01:47:47,163 --> 01:47:48,453
Pritam singh has ruined us.

1382
01:47:49,054 --> 01:47:50,884
He killed seven of our men.

1383
01:47:52,503 --> 01:47:59,233
That Pritam Singh humiliated me,
Rashid Ali, publicly.

1384
01:47:59,814 --> 01:48:02,314
That Mahaveer's behind all this.

1385
01:48:02,634 --> 01:48:05,453
When he couldn't do anything..

1386
01:48:06,113 --> 01:48:07,973
..he put that boy in front.
- Right.

1387
01:48:08,274 --> 01:48:09,684
Don't take them ligthtly.

1388
01:48:10,743 --> 01:48:13,503
Master and Mahaveer will
do their best to make Omveer win.

1389
01:48:13,963 --> 01:48:15,863
And now even Pritam
Singh is with them.

1390
01:48:16,363 --> 01:48:18,393
I say kill that
Mahaveer Singh first.

1391
01:48:19,213 --> 01:48:20,533
That will scare everyone.

1392
01:48:25,073 --> 01:48:28,373
Fauji. For the sake of Allah.

1393
01:48:28,783 --> 01:48:31,993
You can shed all the blood
you want after the elections.

1394
01:48:32,413 --> 01:48:33,684
Once I win the elections..

1395
01:48:33,814 --> 01:48:35,914
..you can massacre
half of Ghaziabad.

1396
01:48:36,113 --> 01:48:37,313
No one will utter a word!
Okay.

1397
01:48:39,554 --> 01:48:41,764
Why don't you ever
bring some biscuits along?

1398
01:48:41,934 --> 01:48:43,704
Not a single tooth left to chew,
and you demand biscuits.

1399
01:48:43,863 --> 01:48:44,863
You're so late.

1400
01:48:46,224 --> 01:48:47,734
What else do you want me to do?

1401
01:48:48,673 --> 01:48:50,573
Say yes, darling?

1402
01:48:50,823 --> 01:48:52,094
Sir, how about some tea for me?

1403
01:48:52,234 --> 01:48:53,654
Why, are you my kin?

1404
01:48:54,623 --> 01:48:55,673
What are you doing?
Massage it properly.

1405
01:48:55,984 --> 01:48:57,324
Son, be like a commando.

1406
01:49:13,373 --> 01:49:15,623
Run. Quickly.

1407
01:49:16,934 --> 01:49:18,064
SP sir's here!

1408
01:49:18,194 --> 01:49:19,084
SP sir's here!

1409
01:49:19,194 --> 01:49:20,654
SP sir's here!

1410
01:49:23,474 --> 01:49:24,724
Sir. SP sir's here!

1411
01:49:25,783 --> 01:49:28,123
Sir, SP sir's here!
- Ask him to sit.

1412
01:49:29,783 --> 01:49:31,643
Sir, SP sir's here!

1413
01:49:31,904 --> 01:49:32,904
Ask him in.

1414
01:49:35,604 --> 01:49:36,604
Sir.

1415
01:49:45,043 --> 01:49:46,043
What's all this?

1416
01:49:46,394 --> 01:49:47,394
What's all this?

1417
01:49:47,524 --> 01:49:49,904
Criminals are trotting
around in police uniforms.

1418
01:49:50,613 --> 01:49:51,613
What are you doing?

1419
01:49:56,474 --> 01:49:57,474
Surprising, sir.

1420
01:49:58,184 --> 01:50:00,173
He's got an exact
copy of our uniform.

1421
01:50:00,804 --> 01:50:02,514
That's why no one
could recognise him.

1422
01:50:03,694 --> 01:50:05,274
Ten people are dead
and you're joking.

1423
01:50:05,654 --> 01:50:08,084
Sir, you're doubting me?

1424
01:50:08,743 --> 01:50:09,743
Me?

1425
01:50:10,033 --> 01:50:12,223
Sir, Pritam Singh
is a very honest officer.

1426
01:50:13,274 --> 01:50:14,374
Just a minute, sir.

1427
01:50:21,224 --> 01:50:22,484
Here's my service revolver.

1428
01:50:22,953 --> 01:50:24,913
I haven't fired
a single bullet, sir.

1429
01:50:25,783 --> 01:50:27,233
I've an account of every bullet.

1430
01:50:29,503 --> 01:50:31,823
You never need
your service bullets.

1431
01:50:32,863 --> 01:50:36,153
People just keep dying around you.

1432
01:50:36,493 --> 01:50:38,563
And, no one knows how they do.

1433
01:50:39,173 --> 01:50:42,184
Pritam,
change your mode of working.

1434
01:50:42,564 --> 01:50:44,194
We've to answer to our superiors.

1435
01:50:44,413 --> 01:50:46,673
Don't create a new
problem during elections.

1436
01:50:46,904 --> 01:50:48,604
Get that? - Yes, sir.

1437
01:51:00,083 --> 01:51:02,063
Close this Satbeer matter quickly.

1438
01:51:09,033 --> 01:51:10,884
Sir, I think we'll have
to do something about Satbeer.

1439
01:51:11,804 --> 01:51:12,913
He's like family.

1440
01:51:13,604 --> 01:51:15,394
We'll kill whenever we want.

1441
01:51:35,734 --> 01:51:38,744
The results of the elections
in UP have be declared.

1442
01:51:39,123 --> 01:51:42,764
The results of Meerut,
Saharanpur, Modi Nagar..

1443
01:51:42,993 --> 01:51:46,073
..show that the
democratic candidates..

1444
01:51:46,283 --> 01:51:48,763
..are in lead from their
party's closest competitors.

1445
01:51:49,043 --> 01:51:52,623
And the recent voting
results from Ghaziabad..

1446
01:51:52,854 --> 01:51:54,694
..show that influential
leader Rashid Ali..

1447
01:51:54,934 --> 01:51:58,534
..has defeated his close competitor
Omveer by one lakh votes.

1448
01:52:17,104 --> 01:52:21,894
I promise,
that your brother Rashid..

1449
01:52:22,583 --> 01:52:27,693
..will repay your
debt with his blood.

1450
01:52:36,363 --> 01:52:38,493
We're receiving news from
all the areas in our favour.

1451
01:52:40,213 --> 01:52:42,804
Just get ready to
become the minister.

1452
01:52:44,224 --> 01:52:45,293
Pray for me.

1453
01:52:47,654 --> 01:52:50,464
Let's have dinner at
master's house tonight.

1454
01:52:59,283 --> 01:53:01,763
Mother, I've cooked
his favourite meal today.

1455
01:53:13,514 --> 01:53:16,913
Fauji's army.. - Will have fun!

1456
01:53:22,264 --> 01:53:23,384
Mother.
Look out!

1457
01:53:32,493 --> 01:53:33,623
Master!

1458
01:53:35,033 --> 01:53:37,753
You like firing a gun wearing
this uniform, don't you?

1459
01:53:38,024 --> 01:53:40,614
I'll bury you in
your own house today.

1460
01:53:41,253 --> 01:53:42,094
Mother.

1461
01:53:42,213 --> 01:53:43,514
Where's Rahul? - Rahul!

1462
01:53:50,873 --> 01:53:53,014
Stop. - Where are you going?
- Rahul's outside.

1463
01:53:54,873 --> 01:53:56,063
Rahul!

1464
01:53:59,764 --> 01:54:02,003
Your uncle...isn't listening to me.

1465
01:54:03,283 --> 01:54:04,933
Call him out.

1466
01:54:05,854 --> 01:54:08,114
Uncle's not at home.

1467
01:54:08,673 --> 01:54:10,613
What the..

1468
01:54:10,854 --> 01:54:12,554
We wasted all the bullets.

1469
01:54:15,243 --> 01:54:16,243
Listen.

1470
01:54:16,474 --> 01:54:19,934
Tell your uncle, "Fauji was here."

1471
01:54:20,934 --> 01:54:23,094
What? - Fauji was here.

1472
01:54:30,163 --> 01:54:31,163
Rahul.

1473
01:54:33,373 --> 01:54:35,403
What happened, son?
- Uncle...Fauji.

1474
01:54:38,713 --> 01:54:39,713
Mother.

1475
01:54:41,413 --> 01:54:42,474
Rahul. - Mother.

1476
01:54:42,974 --> 01:54:43,974
Rahul.

1477
01:54:44,844 --> 01:54:46,184
Mother, are you okay?
Sister-in-law?

1478
01:54:49,373 --> 01:54:50,373
Suman?

1479
01:54:51,554 --> 01:54:52,554
Are you okay?

1480
01:55:20,833 --> 01:55:22,413
No. Suman.

1481
01:55:29,083 --> 01:55:30,083
No.

1482
01:55:38,724 --> 01:55:39,724
Suman.

1483
01:55:40,684 --> 01:55:41,684
Suman.

1484
01:55:58,144 --> 01:56:01,173
Corruption will end
only when humans do.

1485
01:56:01,753 --> 01:56:04,213
Let's see how many seats
does sister win this time.

1486
01:56:05,894 --> 01:56:08,554
Fauji. Hello.

1487
01:56:08,743 --> 01:56:09,613
How are you?

1488
01:56:09,734 --> 01:56:11,864
Get some tea and
snacks for him. - No.

1489
01:56:12,573 --> 01:56:13,783
I'm in a hurry.

1490
01:56:14,764 --> 01:56:15,833
So, why did you call?

1491
01:56:16,134 --> 01:56:19,884
Satbeer's wife...died
in your firing.

1492
01:56:20,333 --> 01:56:22,344
Someone always dies in the firing.

1493
01:56:23,373 --> 01:56:26,523
Fauji...don't you think..

1494
01:56:28,024 --> 01:56:33,064
..you should've told me
before doing something this big?

1495
01:56:33,673 --> 01:56:34,974
You're the MLA now.

1496
01:56:36,663 --> 01:56:38,273
I'll set the city on fire now.

1497
01:56:41,264 --> 01:56:42,264
Fine.

1498
01:56:44,923 --> 01:56:46,014
You're my brother.

1499
01:56:46,484 --> 01:56:47,494
What's done is done.

1500
01:56:48,423 --> 01:56:49,423
I'll take care of it.

1501
01:56:50,833 --> 01:56:51,833
That's all I wanted to say.

1502
01:56:53,474 --> 01:56:54,474
See you.

1503
01:56:56,043 --> 01:56:57,523
How about some tea?
- No, some other time.

1504
01:56:58,404 --> 01:56:59,494
Take care.

1505
01:57:03,163 --> 01:57:05,304
Just because he killed
a few people in the elections..

1506
01:57:06,554 --> 01:57:10,663
..I feel he'll reap the
rewards of me becoming the MLA.

1507
01:57:11,644 --> 01:57:13,934
But, Rashid, Fauji's one of us.

1508
01:57:17,094 --> 01:57:20,364
That's left to see...how
long he's with us.

1509
01:57:26,844 --> 01:57:30,543
"You are my mirror."

1510
01:57:31,184 --> 01:57:34,694
"You are my wealth."

1511
01:57:35,463 --> 01:57:39,213
"You're my temple."

1512
01:57:39,713 --> 01:57:43,054
"You're my heaven."

1513
01:57:43,854 --> 01:57:48,043
"I will protect you always."

1514
01:57:48,384 --> 01:57:52,963
"This promise will never break."

1515
01:57:54,474 --> 01:58:02,434
"All the beautiful moments
were in your company."

1516
01:58:02,894 --> 01:58:06,264
"My heart feels lively again."

1517
01:58:06,613 --> 01:58:09,863
"You're my God!"

1518
01:58:30,743 --> 01:58:31,913
Yes, Sangam.

1519
01:58:32,264 --> 01:58:35,324
We've a live footage
of Satbeer in the riot.

1520
01:58:39,503 --> 01:58:40,503
Congratulations.

1521
01:58:40,863 --> 01:58:42,013
That's more like it.

1522
01:58:42,274 --> 01:58:45,003
Now, I'll send a strong
report to the government..

1523
01:58:45,344 --> 01:58:47,864
..and no one will
be able to save him.

1524
01:58:48,144 --> 01:58:50,274
Just wait and watch the fun.

1525
01:58:50,533 --> 01:58:53,263
Thank you, Sangam. Thank you.

1526
01:58:56,083 --> 01:58:57,884
Satbeer's been taken care of.

1527
01:58:58,283 --> 01:59:00,533
He was driving me crazy.
I couldn't sleep at nights.

1528
01:59:00,703 --> 01:59:03,893
Now for the inspector. What
should we do about the inspector?

1529
01:59:05,814 --> 01:59:07,114
I've an idea.

1530
01:59:19,184 --> 01:59:20,184
Shut up, you witch.

1531
01:59:20,474 --> 01:59:21,474
Take her.

1532
01:59:25,944 --> 01:59:28,454
Fauji started this tiff, not us.

1533
01:59:30,033 --> 01:59:31,823
By falsely accusing
brother Satbeer.

1534
01:59:32,134 --> 01:59:33,283
Of attacking his house.

1535
01:59:33,743 --> 01:59:34,743
Remember?

1536
01:59:35,163 --> 01:59:36,243
The rascal.

1537
01:59:37,064 --> 01:59:39,764
He turned a good man
into a wanted criminal.

1538
01:59:58,073 --> 01:59:59,513
Who brought her here?

1539
02:00:00,234 --> 02:00:01,234
I did.

1540
02:00:08,224 --> 02:00:11,354
I apologise for
my brother's mistake.

1541
02:00:14,123 --> 02:00:15,713
He killed my sister-in-law.

1542
02:00:17,764 --> 02:00:20,024
He opened fire on our house.

1543
02:00:21,264 --> 02:00:23,003
I only brought her here..

1544
02:00:23,213 --> 02:00:25,854
..to drag that snake
out of his burrow..

1545
02:00:26,043 --> 02:00:27,173
..so that I can kill him.

1546
02:00:27,304 --> 02:00:29,163
Your brother isn't
that weak, that..

1547
02:00:30,404 --> 02:00:32,654
..he'll have to take
the help of a woman..

1548
02:00:34,524 --> 02:00:35,923
..to kill a dog like Fauji.

1549
02:00:37,404 --> 02:00:38,554
You don't understand, brother.

1550
02:00:39,953 --> 02:00:41,813
We won't get a better chance.

1551
02:00:42,524 --> 02:00:44,064
I mean it, we won't.. - Enough.

1552
02:00:44,974 --> 02:00:49,644
Enough. You'll take
her back right now.

1553
02:00:50,194 --> 02:00:51,194
Got it.

1554
02:00:51,863 --> 02:00:56,273
Don't show me your face
until you don't take her back.

1555
02:01:02,203 --> 02:01:03,203
Hello.

1556
02:01:03,814 --> 02:01:04,814
Satbeer.

1557
02:01:05,583 --> 02:01:06,344
Yes, Mr. Thakur.

1558
02:01:06,463 --> 02:01:09,203
Rashid and Sangam are
preparing a report against you.

1559
02:01:09,444 --> 02:01:10,564
To send it to the government.

1560
02:01:10,743 --> 02:01:14,393
If this happens, then I
won't be able to help you legally.

1561
02:01:14,833 --> 02:01:16,533
I don't have any expectations
with the law anyway.

1562
02:01:31,154 --> 02:01:34,044
Omi, brother Satbeer's right.

1563
02:01:35,354 --> 02:01:36,503
Let's take her back.

1564
02:02:16,323 --> 02:02:17,533
Fauji!

1565
02:02:17,673 --> 02:02:18,673
I will..

1566
02:03:01,623 --> 02:03:04,344
If you see Fauji in your dreams..

1567
02:03:05,123 --> 02:03:06,384
..it makes you pee.

1568
02:03:07,194 --> 02:03:09,874
But you've seen him in person.

1569
02:03:32,054 --> 02:03:33,644
Satbeer hadn't attacked your house.

1570
02:04:11,743 --> 02:04:16,804
Satbeer's law isn't
helpless like yours, Sangam.

1571
02:04:18,953 --> 02:04:23,634
No court, no appeal, no date.

1572
02:04:24,634 --> 02:04:25,634
Just punishment.

1573
02:04:45,453 --> 02:04:47,773
What's so urgent
that you called me here?

1574
02:04:48,304 --> 02:04:49,953
Come in, I want you to see a film.

1575
02:04:52,224 --> 02:04:53,264
You too.

1576
02:04:54,363 --> 02:04:55,833
You should see it too.

1577
02:05:00,764 --> 02:05:02,814
Inspector. How have we harmed you?

1578
02:05:03,644 --> 02:05:06,354
Why are you after us?

1579
02:05:06,804 --> 02:05:09,944
You don't have the stature
to lock horns with Pritam Singh.

1580
02:05:10,503 --> 02:05:13,463
I'm after you because
you're with Fauji.

1581
02:05:14,003 --> 02:05:15,453
You're with Satbeer as well.

1582
02:05:15,783 --> 02:05:17,833
Let's put the past behind us.

1583
02:05:18,453 --> 02:05:20,804
We're here to propose friendship.

1584
02:05:21,823 --> 02:05:24,413
Then, give me the token
of friendship. - How's that?

1585
02:05:25,274 --> 02:05:26,274
Give me Fauji.

1586
02:05:30,734 --> 02:05:33,104
Fauji's not a kin, take him.

1587
02:05:33,993 --> 02:05:34,804
Fine.

1588
02:05:34,923 --> 02:05:36,734
We give you Fauji,
you give us Satbeer.

1589
02:05:37,344 --> 02:05:39,573
Name Satbeer's price.
- Two billion.

1590
02:05:41,333 --> 02:05:42,993
The money will be
at your home by evening.

1591
02:05:43,444 --> 02:05:44,444
And, Satbeer.

1592
02:05:44,913 --> 02:05:46,913
After that, you will have Satbeer.

1593
02:05:47,404 --> 02:05:49,704
Fakira.
I know all about your ruse..

1594
02:05:49,884 --> 02:05:53,094
..you plotted by
attacking Fauji's home.

1595
02:05:57,404 --> 02:05:59,334
That's Ghaziabad, Inspector.

1596
02:05:59,833 --> 02:06:03,764
And you know, you shouldn't
take anyone here lightly.

1597
02:06:16,594 --> 02:06:17,984
He's lying.

1598
02:06:18,373 --> 02:06:19,373
Rascal!

1599
02:06:20,793 --> 02:06:22,134
That film's a fake.

1600
02:06:28,833 --> 02:06:30,453
Rashid mislead me.

1601
02:06:31,713 --> 02:06:33,064
I was naive.

1602
02:06:37,274 --> 02:06:39,744
I did all this for
the chairman's post.

1603
02:06:40,304 --> 02:06:41,743
Forgive me, please.

1604
02:06:43,404 --> 02:06:45,084
We're best friends.

1605
02:06:46,043 --> 02:06:48,184
Sorry, sorry.

1606
02:06:49,243 --> 02:06:51,264
No, don't shoot me.

1607
02:06:51,993 --> 02:06:54,643
No, no, no, don't shoot me.

1608
02:06:55,104 --> 02:06:56,704
I'm like your younger brother.

1609
02:06:57,344 --> 02:06:59,234
I love you a lot.

1610
02:06:59,594 --> 02:07:01,003
Don't shoot me! Don't shoot me!

1611
02:07:01,144 --> 02:07:03,104
Don't shoot me!

1612
02:07:03,354 --> 02:07:06,234
Don't shoot me!

1613
02:07:10,823 --> 02:07:11,993
Double-crosser.

1614
02:07:15,384 --> 02:07:16,554
That Rashid!

1615
02:07:17,283 --> 02:07:19,243
He's forgotten his place
since he became a politician.

1616
02:07:20,503 --> 02:07:24,043
He's selling his own
brother...to that inspector.

1617
02:07:24,673 --> 02:07:25,854
Call the boys.

1618
02:07:26,314 --> 02:07:27,744
We'll kill master first.

1619
02:07:28,083 --> 02:07:30,354
Then Rashid,
and then the inspector.

1620
02:07:30,533 --> 02:07:31,533
Brother..

1621
02:07:32,684 --> 02:07:33,844
I'll come along too.

1622
02:07:34,823 --> 02:07:35,823
Are you out of your mind?

1623
02:07:36,974 --> 02:07:38,244
If you don't come back..

1624
02:07:41,104 --> 02:07:43,934
..I'll never marry
anyone all my life.

1625
02:07:48,024 --> 02:07:50,494
God will think a hundred times..

1626
02:07:51,474 --> 02:07:53,083
..before taking Fauji's life.

1627
02:07:55,654 --> 02:07:57,254
Before you leave, I want to know.

1628
02:07:58,083 --> 02:08:02,783
If something happens to you,
what should I do with your child?

1629
02:08:05,304 --> 02:08:06,304
What the..

1630
02:08:07,923 --> 02:08:09,243
Junior Fauji's on the way.

1631
02:08:11,663 --> 02:08:12,663
Did you hear?

1632
02:08:12,823 --> 02:08:14,353
Junior Fauji's on the way.

1633
02:08:16,884 --> 02:08:18,594
Junior Fauji's on the way.

1634
02:08:20,363 --> 02:08:23,143
Junior Fauji!

1635
02:08:43,993 --> 02:08:48,384
'Don't show me your face...
until you take her back.'

1636
02:09:07,923 --> 02:09:11,524
Satbeer, don't go anywhere.

1637
02:09:12,163 --> 02:09:14,804
They're planning to kill you..

1638
02:09:15,064 --> 02:09:18,834
..along with Fauji's gang. Yes.

1639
02:09:19,863 --> 02:09:24,793
Thakur has made a deal
with Rashid for two billion.

1640
02:09:28,583 --> 02:09:33,363
I don't know whether
Satbeer survives or not..

1641
02:09:35,394 --> 02:09:40,003
..but no one can save Fauji today.

1642
02:09:41,144 --> 02:09:47,384
If death comes between us,
I'll kill death too.

1643
02:09:50,764 --> 02:09:51,764
Son..

1644
02:10:00,793 --> 02:10:01,793
Go, son.

1645
02:10:03,474 --> 02:10:05,614
I want you to give
Fauji a brutal death..

1646
02:10:07,503 --> 02:10:11,764
..so that God thinks twice before..

1647
02:10:12,604 --> 02:10:13,614
..creating demons like him.

1648
02:10:38,384 --> 02:10:40,264
Killed for no reason.

1649
02:10:41,804 --> 02:10:43,413
One by one they all perished.

1650
02:10:45,144 --> 02:10:47,194
Who will erase their existence?

1651
02:10:50,764 --> 02:10:53,703
Who can it be,
other than rascal me?

1652
02:11:24,423 --> 02:11:25,833
Welcome, Fauji.

1653
02:11:25,974 --> 02:11:26,974
Hello.

1654
02:11:29,753 --> 02:11:30,753
What's wrong?

1655
02:11:30,974 --> 02:11:32,623
You look upset!
Something wrong?

1656
02:11:36,734 --> 02:11:38,814
You made a big mistake, Rashid..

1657
02:11:39,104 --> 02:11:40,934
..by dreaming about Rashid's death.

1658
02:11:41,724 --> 02:11:45,894
Fauji...politics
is a different game.

1659
02:11:46,503 --> 02:11:48,753
A politician and a gangster
can't be friends for too long..

1660
02:11:48,923 --> 02:11:49,923
..and you know that.

1661
02:11:50,064 --> 02:11:52,834
I needed you, and I used you.

1662
02:11:53,033 --> 02:11:55,223
You're no longer needed,
end of your story.

1663
02:13:38,073 --> 02:13:39,303
So, Pritam Singh.

1664
02:13:40,154 --> 02:13:41,954
You cheated me even
after taking two billion.

1665
02:13:43,384 --> 02:13:44,623
You showed the true
colours of the police.

1666
02:13:44,984 --> 02:13:46,574
You'll need a few more lifetimes..

1667
02:13:46,724 --> 02:13:48,123
..to understand the police.

1668
02:13:49,373 --> 02:13:51,273
But any number of
lifetimes aren't enough..

1669
02:13:51,663 --> 02:13:53,264
..to understand Pritam Singh.

1670
02:13:53,413 --> 02:13:54,993
I won't spare you!

1671
02:14:07,743 --> 02:14:08,823
Bloody politician!

1672
02:16:29,823 --> 02:16:34,413
Master. Your luck's really bad.

1673
02:17:42,353 --> 02:17:44,663
Gandhiji's first principle
is 'non-violence'.

1674
02:17:45,424 --> 02:17:50,484
"What bullets can't achieve,
sweet talks can."

1675
02:17:50,974 --> 02:17:51,844
Repeat after me.

1676
02:17:51,963 --> 02:17:59,533
"What bullets can't achieve,
sweet talks can!"

1677
02:18:00,644 --> 02:18:07,744
"What bullets can't achieve,
sweet talks can!"

1678
02:18:09,334 --> 02:18:11,104
Why don't you move to Delhi?

1679
02:18:11,664 --> 02:18:13,634
Why don't you think
about your future?

1680
02:18:13,994 --> 02:18:15,203
I want to stay here.

1681
02:18:17,174 --> 02:18:19,114
And mend the future of my village.

1682
02:18:46,093 --> 02:18:48,103
The motif of my life's finished.

1683
02:18:50,564 --> 02:18:53,914
There's nothing left for me.

1684
02:18:57,004 --> 02:18:58,004
Here, big brother.

1685
02:18:59,523 --> 02:19:00,894
And shoot me.

1686
02:19:13,783 --> 02:19:17,173
'It was against Pritam Singh's
nature to let any criminal live.'

1687
02:19:18,664 --> 02:19:20,764
'But, there was something
about Satbeer..'

1688
02:19:21,093 --> 02:19:22,313
'..that touched my heart.'

1689
02:19:22,724 --> 02:19:24,474
'And, for the first time,
Pritam Singh..'

1690
02:19:24,634 --> 02:19:26,123
'..got someone punished legally..'

1691
02:19:26,263 --> 02:19:28,533
'..instead of punishing
him in his style.'

1692
02:19:29,283 --> 02:19:33,773
'Because, if I had killed him,
God wouldn't have forgiven me.'

1693
02:19:39,504 --> 02:19:40,744
We're proud of you, Pritam.

1694
02:19:41,343 --> 02:19:42,343
Keep it up.

1695
02:19:52,963 --> 02:19:53,963
Well done!
