126
00:47:18,101 --> 00:47:20,069
No, thief leaves so much of evidence

127
00:47:23,974 --> 00:47:25,942

128
00:47:28,111 --> 00:47:30,079

Do you think he will loot again
If he has the courage

130
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:39,088
People are afraid

131
00:47:44,962 --> 00:47:46,930
I don't think we must fear
this thief

132
00:47:51,101 --> 00:47:53,069
He is a clown

133
00:47:53,971 --> 00:47:55,939
When i get him
He will entertain in jail

134
00:47:58,008 --> 00:48:00,076
Do you think you can get him
Destiny is always in police hands

135
00:48:03,981 --> 00:48:05,949

150
00:49:54,124 --> 00:49:56,092
He had no enemy
And he won't speak to anyon

151
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,928
After the show he  dissapeared
in his room

152
00:49:59,129 --> 00:50:01,097
He is known as charlie

153
00:50:17,981 --> 00:50:19,949

160
00:50:59,122 --> 00:51:01,090

Enter the bank and know all

203
01:17:47,129 --> 01:17:49,097
Only three men knew about the codes

204
01:17:51,967 --> 01:17:53,935
Two police officers and the other thief

205
01:17:56,104 --> 01:17:58,072

214
01:19:18,954 --> 01:19:20,922

I only wanted to be friend with you

216
01:19:27,963 --> 01:19:29,931
Thief and a police are enemy 

217
01:19:33,101 --> 01:19:35,069
Brother,we need to go

218
01:19:44,980 --> 01:19:46,948
I feel pity for myself

223
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:07,088
Is the pain too much

224
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:06,948
You won't find aything

225
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:14,088
Take this and go
Let it go

226
01:23:32,974 --> 01:23:34,942
Do not try and act smart

227
01:23:47,122 --> 01:23:49,090
We are god's grace

228
01:23:53,962 --> 01:23:55,930
We must have faith

229
01:24:37,105 --> 01:24:39,073
Papa has two

230
01:24:41,976 --> 01:24:43,944
One is intellegent
And the other is weak

231
01:24:47,115 --> 01:24:49,083
I was the secret for papa

232
01:24:56,958 --> 01:24:58,926
That day papa had one more secret

233
01:24:59,127 --> 01:25:01,095
No one knew about

234
01:25:09,971 --> 01:25:11,939
You said i am the secret

235
01:25:15,110 --> 01:25:17,078
No, one must come to know about me

236
01:25:26,955 --> 01:25:28,923
Papa i was inside the box
I had no fear

237
01:25:38,099 --> 01:25:40,067

That is why, i hide you

241
01:25:56,117 --> 01:25:58,085
You are my secret

242
01:26:07,962 --> 01:26:09,930
Oly ca rry h i m
He is grown up... he is not a child

243
01:26:14,102 --> 01:26:16,070

244
01:26:45,967 --> 01:26:47,935

01:26:56,978 --> 01:26:58,946
Don't ever let sa hil ' s had

247
01:26:59,113 --> 01:27:01,081
Not ever

248
01:27:14,963 --> 01:27:16,931
No one can fight the bank

249
01:27:21,102 --> 01:27:23,070
Bank is Iike a rock

250
01:27:26,975 --> 01:27:28,943
That day we knew we drop the bank

251
01:27:37,118 --> 01:27:39,086
It's the bank or we survive

252
01:28:54,962 --> 01:28:56,930
Papa, alway's said I'm his angel

253
01:28:57,098 --> 01:28:59,066
I have magic in my hand

254
01:29:03,971 --> 01:29:05,939
This is my blood

255
01:29:19,954 --> 01:29:21,922
The passage is very narrow

256
01:30:19,113 --> 01:30:21,081
It's a secret

257
01:30:42,103 --> 01:30:44,071
Sahil don't even know my secret

258
01:30:45,973 --> 01:30:47,941
My secret is...

259
01:30:53,114 --> 01:30:55,082
Aliya h

260
01:30:59,954 --> 01:31:01,922
There is no good man for her
in this entire world

261
01:31:05,126 --> 01:31:07,094
She is the best

262
01:31:09,964 --> 01:31:11,932
Her name is very cute

263
01:32:10,992 --> 01:32:11,959
[ Skipped item no. 257 ]

264
01:32:20,101 --> 01:32:22,069
When she is not close to me
I feel happy

265
01:32:25,973 --> 01:32:27,941
Her name is cute

266
01:32:29,110 --> 01:32:31,078

267
01:32:36,951 --> 01:32:38,919

276
01:35:34,128 --> 01:35:36,096

277
01:35:41,969 --> 01:35:43,937

279

281
01:36:09,964 --> 01:36:11,932
Playig the game is fun for me

282
01:42:20,100 --> 01:42:22,068

What everthing you done to samar

440
02:17:44,956 --> 02:17:46,924
You played with his emotions

441
02:18:05,110 --> 02:18:07,078

442
02:18:08,947 --> 02:18:10,915

We are going to shut down the bank

446
02:28:57,962 --> 02:28:59,930
The first time I caught a thief
durig the night

447
02:29:06,103 --> 02:29:08,071
If I was not a police
Surely should write a poem

448
02:30:04,962 --> 02:30:06,930
Brother, let them go
We can't get them

449
02:30:13,104 --> 02:30:15,072
At nig ht it's always victory for a thief
And when the sunlight it's mine

450

And there is no place to run

454
02:33:08,946 --> 02:33:10,914
I am a rrested... but the court
Can't prove me guilty

455
02:33:18,122 --> 02:33:20,090
This is all the evidence

456
02:33:24,962 --> 02:33:26,930
This is all my crime
Let Samar go

457
02:33:29,099 --> 02:33:31,067

459
02:33:36,106 --> 02:33:38,074
Playing was mine

460
02:33:42,947 --> 02:33:44,915
Samar is innocent

461
02:33:45,115 --> 02:33:47,083

There are some rule's to be broke

475
02:38:55,125 --> 02:38:57,093
Victory only meant for one

476
02:39:05,969 --> 02:39:07,937
