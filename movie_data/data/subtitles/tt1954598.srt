1
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:35,828
DELHI

2
00:00:52,136 --> 00:00:53,554
Wow, Dimple!

3
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,766
What wow? Can't see any cleavage!

4
00:00:56,849 --> 00:00:58,058
There has to be some to be seen.

5
00:00:58,184 --> 00:01:01,187
Look after your lemons,
you might just lose them.

6
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:04,648
Look Preeti's is here,
wear your blouse at least.

7
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:06,692
Bossing me in my own house?

8
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:07,902
Put it on.

9
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:09,069
I am ready, guys.

10
00:01:10,112 --> 00:01:11,989
You delay us always.

11
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:13,741
Move aside, my phone is ringing

12
00:01:16,744 --> 00:01:17,828
Sunny!

13
00:01:18,162 --> 00:01:21,373
You will say "I love you"
a hundred times if you see me today.

14
00:01:21,457 --> 00:01:23,542
I am looking red hot.

15
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:26,629
Puchki delayed us.

16
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,507
Have you arrived? We are just leaving.

17
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:31,425
Let's go.

18
00:01:31,634 --> 00:01:33,886
Sunny has been waiting
for so long to see me.

19
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:35,095
Let's go.

20
00:01:36,055 --> 00:01:37,139
Bye, mummy.

21
00:01:37,223 --> 00:01:38,724
Have you taken your cellphone?

22
00:01:38,808 --> 00:01:39,892
iphone, Mummy.

23
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:41,685
Fine then, iphone me.

24
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:47,399
And listen, go to the
ladies' night and come

25
00:01:47,483 --> 00:01:49,735
straight back by 12 o clock or
else your dad won't open the door.

26
00:01:49,819 --> 00:01:50,903
-Bye!
-Bye!

27
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,947
-Bye, aunty.
-Bye, girls.

28
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,234
Help me, guys.

29
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:31,402
Come on, hurry up.

30
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:33,153
-Hi, Sunny!
-Hurry.

31
00:02:33,237 --> 00:02:34,697
Nice bike, Sunny.

32
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:37,575
-Hang on to this.
-If you are ever free from Dimple,

33
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:39,201
then we'd like a ride too.

34
00:02:39,285 --> 00:02:41,453
Is it a cab that he
gives everyone a ride?

35
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:42,746
Find your own biker.

36
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:46,625
If mom calls,
tell her I am with Preeti,

37
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:47,835
not like last time, when you said I was

38
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:49,879
unwell and dad arrived with an ambulance.

39
00:02:49,962 --> 00:02:51,046
Yes, ma'am.

40
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,048
Wait for me at the banquet hall.

41
00:02:53,132 --> 00:02:54,508
-Don't stress.
-Okay, bye.

42
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:55,801
Okay, bye.

43
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:57,261
Bye.

44
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:01,056
-Take your helmet off.
-Come on we are late.

45
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,560
Bye, Sunny!

46
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:31,503
What's in discos and clubs

47
00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:35,174
Nothing in bars and pubs

48
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:46,352
What's in discos and clubs

49
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:49,939
Nothing in bars and pubs

50
00:03:50,022 --> 00:03:53,734
I want to go there

51
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:59,657
Where my bundle of joy's there

52
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,701
My bundle of joy

53
00:04:02,952 --> 00:04:07,039
You are my pretty little face

54
00:04:07,122 --> 00:04:11,919
My bundle of joy

55
00:04:19,635 --> 00:04:23,222
Cafes and Starbucks are dull

56
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:26,892
Limos and trucks are no fun

57
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:37,987
Cafes and Starbucks are dull

58
00:04:38,112 --> 00:04:41,699
Limos and trucks are no fun

59
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:45,411
I want to go where

60
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:47,830
You will be there

61
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:51,208
My bundle of joy

62
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,461
My bundle of joy

63
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:58,757
You are my pretty little face

64
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:03,637
My bundle of joy

65
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:20,446
I miss you every day

66
00:05:20,571 --> 00:05:22,281
You ditch me every way

67
00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:25,993
It's always a bitch

68
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,995
I miss you every day

69
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,788
You ditch me every way

70
00:05:29,872 --> 00:05:33,584
I miss you every day

71
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:37,004
Make a plan, then you ditch

72
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:40,841
Not fair, not fair, it's just not fair

73
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:44,553
You look so cute

74
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,805
Especially when you brood

75
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:50,601
My bundle of joy

76
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:53,854
My bundle of joy

77
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:57,858
You are my pretty little face

78
00:05:57,941 --> 00:06:02,780
My bundle of joy

79
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:28,889
On your sweet sexy Punjabi face

80
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:32,601
It's so cute to ogle 
 At your Gucci goggle

81
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:36,230
On your sweet sexy Punjabi face

82
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:39,858
It's so cute to ogle 
 At your Gucci goggle

83
00:06:39,942 --> 00:06:42,736
Like in a large lassi pot

84
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:47,407
Fell very small Vodka shot

85
00:06:47,491 --> 00:06:51,120
Hearing all your praises

86
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:53,455
My ego races

87
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:57,126
My bundle of joy

88
00:06:57,209 --> 00:07:00,170
My bundle of joy

89
00:07:00,254 --> 00:07:04,466
You are my pretty little face

90
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:09,304
My bundle of joy

91
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:00,689
-Hello, Uncle.
-I have told her so many times.

92
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:01,940
Uncle, there's a lot of weight here.

93
00:08:02,024 --> 00:08:04,318
Let me put her down
first then, you can scold me.

94
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:07,571
I think she can answer your
questions only in the morning.

95
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:08,822
Who are you?

96
00:08:08,906 --> 00:08:10,699
Sunny. Boyfriend.

97
00:08:11,033 --> 00:08:13,118
I am a trainer at the
Power House Gym. GK branch.

98
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:14,786
Dimple and I met there.

99
00:08:15,037 --> 00:08:16,830
Upstairs would be better?

100
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:18,957
Aunty...

101
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:20,125
You are a body builder, right?

102
00:08:33,597 --> 00:08:38,227
So, body builder, now tell me,
what did you do to my daughter?

103
00:08:39,895 --> 00:08:43,273
Had I done something, I wouldn't
have brought her back in one piece.

104
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:46,902
Out here, they are killed
and stuffed into an oven.

105
00:08:48,487 --> 00:08:50,113
I respect you a lot, Sir.

106
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:52,783
Dimple has told me
everything about you,

107
00:08:53,242 --> 00:08:54,368
self-made man.

108
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:56,370
To start from a garage

109
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:59,248
and establish such a huge
property empire is no joke.

110
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:05,504
I wanted to meet you myself,
but not like this.

111
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:09,633
With a presentation of a plan for
a chain of All-India gymnasiums.

112
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:13,136
Anyway not now, you must be tired.

113
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,889
I'll take an appointment
and meet you later.

114
00:09:22,688 --> 00:09:24,273
I am your daughter's boyfriend.

115
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:26,525
I won't do anything wrong.

116
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:29,069
Trust me.

117
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:32,197
Should I park the car inside?

118
00:09:32,364 --> 00:09:33,448
How will you go home?

119
00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:36,576
Bus, auto, I'll take anything,
I left my bike at the gym.

120
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:40,455
Take the car
and bring it back in the morning,

121
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:42,332
but there shouldn't be
even a scratch on it.

122
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,793
I won't get a scratch on it.

123
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:47,421
Not on the car nor on your daughter.

124
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:49,715
Good night sir, aunty.

125
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,049
Good night, son.

126
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:56,722
I had to brush four times to
get rid of the Vodka smell.

127
00:09:56,805 --> 00:09:58,890
What if papa had caught me? And you?

128
00:09:59,308 --> 00:10:02,602
Walked out making a good impression,
and making me look like a fool.

129
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:04,938
Couldn't you stop me
when I was chugging the shot?

130
00:10:05,022 --> 00:10:07,566
What happened? Why did we stop?

131
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:09,609
Should I get off?

132
00:10:17,743 --> 00:10:21,580
What're you doing, Sunny?

133
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:23,165
Where you going, Sunny?

134
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:26,293
Bloody murderers,

135
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:31,923
finished off my mother and father,
you will rot in this house.

136
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:37,512
Why are you throwing stones?

137
00:10:37,888 --> 00:10:40,390
Broke all the panes, you die.

138
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:42,476
Shut up, you witch, you old woman.

139
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:44,978
Netrapal! Netrapal! Oye, Rawat!

140
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:47,356
Catch him, don't let him go.

141
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:49,191
Run, Sunny, run.

142
00:10:59,201 --> 00:11:00,952
Start the bike.

143
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:02,454
Go, go, go...

144
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:06,666
Where are you running? Stop!

145
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:57,801
Sorry.

146
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,846
Sunny, tell me the full story.

147
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,600
You've lost three kilos,
you deserve a chocolate.

148
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:07,561
-I am leaving.
-Listen...

149
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:16,111
You have enough problems of your own,
why do you want to hear mine?

150
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:18,155
You call me your girlfriend,

151
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:20,907
can't even share your
problems with your girlfriend?

152
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:37,507
That house is mine.

153
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:40,719
Yours?

154
00:12:42,888 --> 00:12:44,264
My grandfather built it.

155
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:46,975
Papa was born there.

156
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:51,021
When my grandfather got transferred,
he put the house up for rent.

157
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:54,399
And when he came back those...

158
00:12:57,235 --> 00:12:59,070
Those assholes did not leave the house.

159
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,283
My grandfather filed a case.

160
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,244
Fighting the case, he died first,

161
00:13:07,204 --> 00:13:08,872
then my father and then mother,

162
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:11,124
along went the entire bank balance.

163
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:15,253
After three deaths the court
ruled in favor of the tenants

164
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:17,923
under the Rent Control Act of 1947.

165
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:22,677
Now, they pay only 1,500 rupees rent
for such a big house

166
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,555
and I pay a property tax
of 60 thousand every year

167
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:27,599
and if I don't pay up,
I get an arrest warrant.

168
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:34,898
I am sorry, I didn't mean to grumble.

169
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,418
Your pain, my pain.

170
00:13:57,045 --> 00:14:00,674
No, you look best laughing.

171
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:03,927
Don't get involved in my tears.

172
00:14:04,636 --> 00:14:06,429
We will all laugh together,

173
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:08,265
and make those MFs cry.

174
00:14:10,392 --> 00:14:11,476
How?

175
00:14:12,811 --> 00:14:14,271
Good evening, Dimple ma'am.

176
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:17,148
Papa, help. There is big crisis.

177
00:14:17,232 --> 00:14:18,817
Dimple? Mr. Kamal is here.

178
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:21,486
Uncle, can you step out please?

179
00:14:21,653 --> 00:14:23,113
Mr. Chaddha, what's this nonsense?

180
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:24,281
Two minutes please.

181
00:14:24,406 --> 00:14:26,199
Not nonsense! I am Dimple Chaddha.

182
00:14:26,283 --> 00:14:27,576
This shop is named after me.

183
00:14:27,742 --> 00:14:29,452
I am telling you
politely to wait outside,

184
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:31,121
once our meeting is done then,
you can have your's.

185
00:14:31,246 --> 00:14:32,831
Okay? Happy? Out!

186
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:36,042
Papa, help us.

187
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:38,962
-Us? Means?
-Me and Sunny. Ours.

188
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:40,630
Get Sunny back his bungalow.

189
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,382
Sunny has a bungalow?

190
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:44,843
Yes, on Barakhamba Road.

191
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:50,682
Sunny owns a
bungalow on Barakhamba Road?

192
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:54,811
Where do you think you are entering?

193
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:57,522
Throw this out.

194
00:14:57,814 --> 00:14:58,982
Throw this out as well.

195
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:05,155
Take this, break this, come on.

196
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:40,398
Uncle can I have a look inside?

197
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:43,360
Of course, it's your bungalow,
you are the landlord.

198
00:15:43,485 --> 00:15:44,611
You are the king.

199
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:47,447
-Dimple!
-Yes, mom?

200
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:49,491
No issues, have a good look.

201
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:56,539
It's a proper bungalow.

202
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:57,874
Nice, isn't it?

203
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:00,710
It's cute. It has an old world charm.

204
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:02,295
Come up stairs, there's more.

205
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:03,546
Yeah, lets go.

206
00:16:04,506 --> 00:16:06,800
-From where?
-Come from here.

207
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:08,093
We are going upstairs.

208
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:15,767
Papa made this map himself.

209
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,062
He was born in this room.

210
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:24,943
Papa Sunny's father was born here,

211
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:26,444
it's so exciting, isn't it?

212
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:29,572
But the condition of the
house is not very exciting.

213
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:31,491
What difference does it make, uncle.

214
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:35,120
I am sure, papa and papa's papa
are both thanking you from there

215
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:40,208
that you made it possible for his son
and his grandson to stand here.

216
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:42,043
Son's son.

217
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:44,087
You won't be standing for long.

218
00:16:44,713 --> 00:16:49,968
It's best you sell this while
the market is still piping hot.

219
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:55,598
No, uncle. This house
has an emotional value.

220
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:58,518
Two crores, it will fetch, just like that.

221
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:02,105
With a constantly leaking roof and
these seeping walls,

222
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,815
you will always need security here.

223
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:05,734
How will you manage on your salary?

224
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:08,194
Listen to me. Sell it.

225
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:11,406
Buy a four BHK flat
for one crore in a suburb.

226
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:13,658
Either in Gurgaon or Greater Noida.

227
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:15,994
And with the rest, start a gym.

228
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:19,122
You can't be a trainer
all your life, can you?

229
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:20,331
Isn't it a plan?

230
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:24,836
Pammi, get the bag.

231
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:31,134
Now where will you run
around selling-buying?

232
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:33,386
Let me take the responsibility.

233
00:17:34,304 --> 00:17:36,514
No, I can't trouble you.

234
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:38,850
Dimple's problem, my problem.

235
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:48,526
Twenty Lakhs advance, rest 180,
after the deal is done.

236
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:54,449
Done?

237
00:17:58,745 --> 00:17:59,871
Done.

238
00:18:00,038 --> 00:18:01,122
Superb!

239
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:05,585
Will you keep staring at
the cash or will you hug me?

240
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:06,795
Not her, me!

241
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,716
Bye, Sunny.

242
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,265
You don't care
whether it's a friend or an enemy.

243
00:18:19,891 --> 00:18:23,728
You've taken his eight crore
worth property for just two crores!

244
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:25,939
He is our Dimple's boyfriend!

245
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:28,858
So he's not going to be
a boyfriend forever.

246
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:30,026
Papa!

247
00:18:30,235 --> 00:18:32,695
I mean, soon he will
become our son-in-law.

248
00:18:33,655 --> 00:18:35,156
And everything will be his.

249
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:37,116
Right, dimple?

250
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:47,085
What is this nonsense, Sharma?

251
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:48,962
It's not nonsense, it's a warrant.

252
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:52,090
You entered my house
and beat up my people.

253
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:54,384
Arrest him.

254
00:18:54,843 --> 00:18:57,262
You say it's yours and
I should believe you?

255
00:18:58,054 --> 00:19:00,723
Mr. Sharma I've bought it legally,
from Sunny Singh.

256
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,351
An advance has been paid,
the entire paper work is ready.

257
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:08,189
I even have the original
map made by poor Sunny's dad.

258
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:11,150
-Only the registration is left.
-Registration is not possible.

259
00:19:11,234 --> 00:19:13,486
-Why is not possible?
-Not possible because, a family feud

260
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:15,446
has been going on
since my father's death.

261
00:19:15,572 --> 00:19:17,240
A stay order has been
imposed on that house.

262
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:20,869
If you have a map, I have the
original documents for this property.

263
00:19:20,994 --> 00:19:23,204
I don't see any Sunny Singh in these.

264
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:25,832
I think he's tucked you up.

265
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,386
-Listen carefully.
-Yes, sir.

266
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:39,846
Call Surti...

267
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:42,181
Tell him my bail should be done
before sunset.

268
00:19:42,473 --> 00:19:46,102
If I have to spend even
one night in jail, believe me...

269
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,688
I'll have everyone
buried in this market itself.

270
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:49,939
-Call right away.
-Yes, sir.

271
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:51,357
Papa, where are you going?

272
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:57,614
Papa, what happened? Sharma Uncle?

273
00:19:57,697 --> 00:20:00,241
The Urban Ministry's secretary
happens top be my brother-in-law.

274
00:20:00,325 --> 00:20:02,702
He'll usurp my bungalow.
Put him in there.

275
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:05,455
Papa, don't be scared, I'll be there
with Mummy and Sunny.

276
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:08,875
If you meet Sunny again,
I'll break your legs. No meeting Sunny.

277
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:10,168
Let's go, Sharma.

278
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,502
Why Papa?

279
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:17,383
No, he was Anup's substitute.

280
00:20:18,009 --> 00:20:20,970
He was to leave on Friday,
but he left three days early.

281
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:23,556
But Anup will be back on Friday.

282
00:20:23,765 --> 00:20:25,850
But it looks like
Sunny really suited you.

283
00:20:25,934 --> 00:20:27,018
You're looking fit.

284
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:06,724
What're you scared of?

285
00:21:06,808 --> 00:21:10,937
Give your dad that picture of Sunny's,
which you took.

286
00:21:11,813 --> 00:21:14,482
Dad will kill me
if I even step in front of him.

287
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:17,610
Thank God, he got out on bail today,
or else it would be my neck.

288
00:21:17,694 --> 00:21:19,654
I am sure even your dad
wants his 20 lakhs back, right?

289
00:21:19,821 --> 00:21:21,656
Give it. Your dad will find him.

290
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:23,950
He's not going to get us married
even if he finds Sunny.

291
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:27,078
Papa is going to kill him
in the center of the market.

292
00:21:27,745 --> 00:21:29,914
Now a Sunny-Dimple
match is impossible.

293
00:21:29,998 --> 00:21:32,458
You're impossible.
You're still dreaming of Sunny.

294
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:33,960
It's Papa's fault as well.

295
00:21:34,043 --> 00:21:35,545
Sunny hatched a clever plan.

296
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:36,796
But papa should
have been a bit smart too.

297
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:38,131
Why was he duped?

298
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,383
I love him, Gurmi.

299
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:41,884
You are crazy, Dimple...

300
00:21:55,982 --> 00:21:58,276
At times, one has to lose to win.

301
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:02,822
And that player is 
 the ultimate winner.

302
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:28,556
Your attention, please.  
 The Indian Airline flight to Mumbai,

303
00:22:28,723 --> 00:22:31,934
IC 708 is ready to depart.

304
00:22:32,018 --> 00:22:35,938
Passengers are requested 
 to proceed to Gate Number Four.

305
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:37,023
Thank you.

306
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:55,625
Beware, ladies

307
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,835
I am wicked

308
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:01,547
Oh, ladies

309
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:06,010
I do my misdeeds

310
00:23:06,219 --> 00:23:10,473
Oh, ladies

311
00:23:10,598 --> 00:23:12,683
You like it or not

312
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:14,644
Here I come

313
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:16,771
I steal your hearts

314
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:19,190
What can be done?

315
00:23:19,273 --> 00:23:21,984
Can't help myself, ladies

316
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:24,904
Can't help myself, ladies

317
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:27,031
That's just my way

318
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:29,158
Can't help myself, ladies

319
00:23:29,242 --> 00:23:31,202
That's just my way

320
00:23:35,665 --> 00:23:39,627
I can't help myself

321
00:24:25,006 --> 00:24:29,760
My bio-data is twisted

322
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:33,472
Penned with lipstick

323
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:38,311
I want to be debited in

324
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:42,148
Every ladies bank account

325
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,567
Oh, yes

326
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:46,611
I bow thee my head

327
00:24:46,694 --> 00:24:48,779
Then I steal your heart

328
00:24:48,863 --> 00:24:51,157
That's my bet

329
00:24:51,282 --> 00:24:53,784
Can't help myself, ladies

330
00:24:55,328 --> 00:24:56,871
Can't help myself, ladies

331
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:59,081
That's just my way!

332
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,125
Can't help myself, ladies

333
00:25:01,334 --> 00:25:03,294
That's just my way

334
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:11,594
I can't help myself

335
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:45,044
I steal the shadow from your eye

336
00:25:45,753 --> 00:25:48,798
So smooth am I

337
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:50,841
I enter like a breeze

338
00:25:50,967 --> 00:25:53,844
And exit like a storm

339
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:57,306
That's just my form

340
00:25:57,515 --> 00:25:59,809
I can open every vault

341
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:01,852
I am very well known

342
00:26:01,936 --> 00:26:04,021
Then I steal your heart

343
00:26:04,188 --> 00:26:06,357
Ladies, that's not my fault

344
00:26:06,649 --> 00:26:09,402
Can't help myself, ladies

345
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:12,071
Can't help myself, ladies

346
00:26:12,196 --> 00:26:14,448
That's just my way

347
00:26:14,782 --> 00:26:16,284
Can't help myself, ladies

348
00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:18,369
That's just my way

349
00:26:22,873 --> 00:26:26,669
I can't help myself

350
00:27:28,481 --> 00:27:30,816
Fifty printers for 75 lakhs!

351
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:33,277
We had orders to get the best.

352
00:27:33,361 --> 00:27:35,112
Of course, you had to get the best.

353
00:27:35,196 --> 00:27:36,655
Best in the right price!

354
00:27:37,823 --> 00:27:40,868
Did someone put a gun to your head
to get it at the seller's price?

355
00:27:41,077 --> 00:27:44,288
You are the buyer,
you fix the price. Buyer is king.

356
00:27:44,497 --> 00:27:46,749
-I am sorry, Raina.
-I can't take the blame for every mistake.

357
00:27:47,249 --> 00:27:49,668
The bosses will punish the culprit.

358
00:27:49,752 --> 00:27:51,587
So be ready to be fired.

359
00:27:52,004 --> 00:27:53,964
If you speak to him, he won't fire us.

360
00:27:54,048 --> 00:27:57,885
Please cry in your cubicle,
not here. Okay?

361
00:27:59,095 --> 00:28:01,138
Listen, guys. Market is tough.

362
00:28:01,639 --> 00:28:03,516
Smart ones stay, idiots perish.

363
00:28:03,891 --> 00:28:05,893
Smart or idiot, you choose.

364
00:28:06,852 --> 00:28:08,437
The rest is all good, thanks.

365
00:28:12,066 --> 00:28:15,236
Sir. Yes, Sir. Coming.

366
00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:18,823
Fire the interior designer.

367
00:28:19,198 --> 00:28:22,243
-Sir.
-He has left such a huge blank space.

368
00:28:23,202 --> 00:28:26,497
I want Hussain's horses on this wall.

369
00:28:28,541 --> 00:28:29,667
At any cost.

370
00:28:32,753 --> 00:28:35,339
You have an impressive reputation,
Raina Parulekar.

371
00:28:35,923 --> 00:28:37,967
You can make the impossible,
possible...

372
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:41,846
So will there be a Hussain on
the wall on the inauguration day?

373
00:28:42,513 --> 00:28:43,597
Yes, Sir.

374
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:51,397
-Yes, Nikhil Sir.
 -What about the Hussain?

375
00:28:51,522 --> 00:28:53,065
They are quoting five crores.

376
00:28:53,149 --> 00:28:54,608
That's too expensive.

377
00:28:54,692 --> 00:28:57,486
I know, I am trying
other art galleries as well.

378
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:58,654
Okay.

379
00:29:01,615 --> 00:29:02,825
Yes?

380
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:05,077
Ma'am, the painting you asked for  
 will be available next month.

381
00:29:05,202 --> 00:29:08,205
-No, no, no, I need it in 72 hours.
 -But, Ma'am...

382
00:29:08,289 --> 00:29:11,250
What will I do with it after a month?
Put it in my bedroom?

383
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:13,878
Will an Anjolie Raman do  
 at the same price?

384
00:29:14,044 --> 00:29:15,588
No, Anjolie Raman won't do.

385
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,131
I need a Hussain. Only a Hussain.

386
00:29:18,007 --> 00:29:19,091
Moron.

387
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:26,140
Careful.

388
00:29:39,195 --> 00:29:41,614
Move it, what's going on?

389
00:29:42,448 --> 00:29:44,909
Lady, lady... Relax. Please.

390
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:48,579
I am honking at the truck,
you stick to your business.

391
00:29:48,662 --> 00:29:50,915
The truck is mine
and so is the business.

392
00:29:51,081 --> 00:29:53,042
You look like the transport type guy!

393
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:54,460
Now move it, I am getting late.

394
00:29:54,585 --> 00:29:57,087
It won't move till
everything is off-loaded.

395
00:29:57,171 --> 00:29:58,631
Keep honking.

396
00:29:59,757 --> 00:30:01,717
Careful! Careful! Careful, man. Please.

397
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:04,970
It's not a painting, it's a Hussain.

398
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:07,848
M. F. Hussain. It's a masterpiece.

399
00:30:08,516 --> 00:30:10,184
Do you know how much it's worth?

400
00:30:10,351 --> 00:30:12,394
If something happens to it then...

401
00:30:12,728 --> 00:30:14,355
-Carefully.
-Yes, Sir.

402
00:30:15,231 --> 00:30:17,483
Just be careful! Easy does it!

403
00:30:18,901 --> 00:30:22,696
One second. How much is it?

404
00:30:24,865 --> 00:30:27,952
Five bucks for 100 grams.
Eat in or take away?

405
00:30:29,286 --> 00:30:33,499
Okay, I know it's not peanuts.
It's art, creative and all that,

406
00:30:35,084 --> 00:30:36,961
but how much are you selling it for?

407
00:30:38,504 --> 00:30:41,340
It's an exhibition for art lovers.

408
00:30:42,883 --> 00:30:44,009
Over here?

409
00:30:44,093 --> 00:30:47,471
My gallery, Indigo.
The opening is this evening.

410
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:53,852
Invitation. Come over
if you are interested in art.

411
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:55,980
If you want to buy spicy peanuts,

412
00:30:56,063 --> 00:30:58,482
then the Mithibai College
has the best chutney.

413
00:31:02,903 --> 00:31:03,988
Jerk!

414
00:31:05,114 --> 00:31:08,033
Indigo... Indigo... Indigo...

415
00:31:09,994 --> 00:31:11,996
Deven Idiot Shah.

416
00:31:15,583 --> 00:31:17,501
Market value Rs. 80 lakhs.

417
00:31:18,586 --> 00:31:19,712
Not for sale!

418
00:31:21,005 --> 00:31:22,548
Why not for sale, Mr. Shah?

419
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:26,552
Why not?

420
00:31:44,695 --> 00:31:46,030
Looking for the price tag?

421
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:50,075
Five rupess for 100 grams, freshly baked.

422
00:31:55,122 --> 00:31:56,707
Ninety lakhs. Deal?

423
00:31:58,959 --> 00:32:01,462
And I thought you were
genuinely interested in art.

424
00:32:03,881 --> 00:32:05,758
It's to decorate the office.

425
00:32:08,135 --> 00:32:09,219
What?

426
00:32:09,595 --> 00:32:10,638
I like honesty.

427
00:32:10,763 --> 00:32:11,847
I hate fake.

428
00:32:13,641 --> 00:32:15,225
It's impossible to buy.

429
00:32:15,392 --> 00:32:16,852
Nothing is impossible.

430
00:32:17,478 --> 00:32:19,647
Honestly. The painting isn't mine to sell.

431
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:22,650
It's borrowed from the Suri brothers
for the exhibition.

432
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:26,362
-Mr. Suri Steel and Power Suri?
-Yes.

433
00:32:26,695 --> 00:32:28,656
Manoj and Maneesh Suri. Joint owners.

434
00:32:28,781 --> 00:32:30,616
Couldn't you have said that earlier?

435
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:32,451
You wouldn't have been here then.

436
00:32:32,618 --> 00:32:34,870
You would've found
someone else to flirt with.

437
00:32:38,791 --> 00:32:40,793
I can set up your meeting
with the Suris.

438
00:32:41,001 --> 00:32:43,212
If you can convince them,
you can have your painting.

439
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:44,546
And you, your commission.

440
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:47,091
It's a hard-earned commission,
no cheating.

441
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,387
Raina Parulekar.

442
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:52,554
Deven Shah.

443
00:32:53,514 --> 00:32:54,598
Call me Dev.

444
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,892
Deven, if possible it would be better

445
00:32:57,059 --> 00:32:59,103
to have a meeting
with the older brother.

446
00:32:59,228 --> 00:33:00,979
His position is weaker,

447
00:33:02,189 --> 00:33:03,816
he will surrender faster.

448
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:08,529
Surrender! To Raina the tigress.

449
00:33:09,613 --> 00:33:11,490
The meeting should happen tomorrow.

450
00:33:11,949 --> 00:33:15,244
The day after the painting has to
be up in office for the opening.

451
00:33:15,786 --> 00:33:19,039
At such short notice, only a
phone conversation will be possible.

452
00:33:19,873 --> 00:33:21,834
Phone is good. Bye then.

453
00:33:38,183 --> 00:33:41,478
Sir, I need the financial
stats of Suri Power and Steel.

454
00:33:41,562 --> 00:33:43,605
Buying-selling ratios,
last quarter.

455
00:33:43,689 --> 00:33:46,650
Forget about the Suri's, Raina,
we are two days away.

456
00:33:47,401 --> 00:33:48,902
Concentrate on the Hussain.

457
00:33:50,904 --> 00:33:52,364
I am focused on that, sir.

458
00:34:06,003 --> 00:34:07,004
Hello?

459
00:34:07,087 --> 00:34:08,964
-Is this Raina Parulekar? 
-Yes.

460
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:12,843
I am calling from Mr. Manoj Suri's office, 
 to inform you that

461
00:34:12,926 --> 00:34:15,554
Mr. Suri is not interested in 
 selling his Hussain painting.

462
00:34:15,804 --> 00:34:19,349
Oh, but we are offering
more than its market value.

463
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:21,477
I don't know ma'am, 
 it's Mr. Suri's decision.

464
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,896
I am just conveying 
 the message. Thank you.

465
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:27,441
Wait, wait, wait. Can you
let me talk to him please?

466
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:29,985
My boss's orders,
I have to get that painting.

467
00:34:31,111 --> 00:34:32,196
Please?

468
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:33,697
Okay.

469
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:36,867
Only an employee can
understand another.

470
00:34:37,493 --> 00:34:38,577
I will try.

471
00:34:38,702 --> 00:34:39,912
Okay, hold on.

472
00:34:46,001 --> 00:34:48,796
Hello. Manoj Suri here.

473
00:34:49,171 --> 00:34:50,964
We will not sell that painting.

474
00:34:51,298 --> 00:34:54,051
Hussian is the pride and
glory of Suri Steel and Powers.

475
00:34:54,134 --> 00:34:56,011
Hussain is the life of our company.

476
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:59,181
Mr. Suri, the market value of
the painting is Rs.80,00,000.

477
00:34:59,306 --> 00:35:00,974
We are ready to pay 90.

478
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:02,434
You are ready, I am not.

479
00:35:02,643 --> 00:35:03,769
One crore.

480
00:35:03,852 --> 00:35:05,521
It's an insult to Mr. Hussain.

481
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:07,356
One crore twenty, final.

482
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:09,066
You are insulting me...

483
00:35:09,399 --> 00:35:12,110
It's your younger brother
who is going to insult you.

484
00:35:12,194 --> 00:35:13,529
What do you mean by that?

485
00:35:14,363 --> 00:35:18,575
You and me both know
that your brother wants

486
00:35:18,659 --> 00:35:22,663
to take 51 percent of the shares.

487
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:26,542
So he can sideline and
eventually oust you.

488
00:35:26,667 --> 00:35:28,794
There's bound to be a split in the company

489
00:35:28,961 --> 00:35:30,587
and its assets.

490
00:35:32,005 --> 00:35:34,675
Will the Hussain be yours or his?

491
00:35:39,221 --> 00:35:42,391
Who would've thought that one's
own brother would deceive them?

492
00:35:42,516 --> 00:35:44,560
If we pay you half in cash,

493
00:35:44,977 --> 00:35:47,271
the rest 60 Lakhs by cheque...
with receipt,

494
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:50,524
which will officially
make the price 60 lakhs.

495
00:35:50,816 --> 00:35:55,863
Half of which will be your
cheating brother's part,

496
00:35:55,946 --> 00:35:57,322
making his total 30 lakhs,

497
00:35:57,406 --> 00:35:59,283
and your share 90 lakhs.

498
00:35:59,575 --> 00:36:01,451
I hope causing him a loss of 90 lakhs

499
00:36:01,535 --> 00:36:04,413
will be give you some
sort of... How do say it?

500
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:05,622
Peace.

501
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:08,625
Yes, it will give some peace.

502
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:11,628
So, deal?

503
00:36:12,796 --> 00:36:16,174
Yes, but give the Indigo broker,
his commission on the full price.

504
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:19,052
Why should he incur losses
in my fight with my brother?

505
00:36:19,136 --> 00:36:22,389
Mr. Manoj Suri, you are a very nice man.

506
00:36:24,016 --> 00:36:25,434
I know, I know.

507
00:36:25,893 --> 00:36:28,270
Anyway, take the painting
from the gallery,

508
00:36:28,437 --> 00:36:30,105
give the boy his commission,

509
00:36:30,397 --> 00:36:33,483
and also hand him my
suitcase with cash in it.

510
00:36:33,901 --> 00:36:36,278
Get the cheque sent to
my office by speed post.

511
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:37,905
Are you sure?

512
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:40,449
Hand over 60 lakhs in cash to Dev?

513
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:43,994
He is a simple chap,
he won't even open the bag.

514
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:45,996
Okay, bye.

515
00:36:52,586 --> 00:36:54,463
Yes! Yes! Yes!

516
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:57,215
Careful, guys please.

517
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:03,889
Tigress Parulekar,

518
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:06,808
so you made Mr. Suri surrender.

519
00:37:06,975 --> 00:37:09,061
Worked that magic. Very nicely done.

520
00:37:09,269 --> 00:37:11,021
There is no such thing as magic.

521
00:37:11,605 --> 00:37:12,856
Honest, hard work.

522
00:37:13,315 --> 00:37:15,484
-A cheque for your commission.
-Thank you.

523
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:17,361
And this briefcase for Mr. Suri.

524
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:20,530
It will reach him.

525
00:37:20,697 --> 00:37:21,782
All clear between us?

526
00:37:22,532 --> 00:37:23,617
All clear.

527
00:37:36,338 --> 00:37:37,714
Cheers to Raina!

528
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:39,216
To Hussain!

529
00:37:40,634 --> 00:37:43,220
Since his death,
it's become more precious.

530
00:37:43,303 --> 00:37:44,429
Sir, Mr. Suri...

531
00:37:44,513 --> 00:37:45,931
-Manoj Suri?
-Yes, sir.

532
00:37:46,932 --> 00:37:49,101
Please tell me,
when are you getting here?

533
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:50,727
Forget that, first tell me,

534
00:37:50,811 --> 00:37:53,063
how did you set claims 
 on my Hussain painting?

535
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:54,731
We never had any deal,

536
00:37:54,815 --> 00:37:56,441
what rumors are you spreading?

537
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:57,985
Hello...

538
00:37:58,068 --> 00:38:00,362
Call Raina. Now!

539
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:02,698
-Yes, sir.
-The painting is not a fake, Sir.

540
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:04,950
Mr. Suri is confused.

541
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:08,203
Mr. Suri is the owner
of Suri Power and Steel,

542
00:38:08,954 --> 00:38:11,248
not a desperate manager level employee

543
00:38:11,373 --> 00:38:14,084
who will use cheap tricks
to get ahead.

544
00:38:15,377 --> 00:38:18,964
Not a cheap trick, Sir.
I only followed your orders.

545
00:38:19,089 --> 00:38:22,259
The orders were to get a
genuine painting, not a fake.

546
00:38:22,926 --> 00:38:25,554
How will I justify such a big scam?

547
00:38:28,348 --> 00:38:29,599
Not a scam, Sir.

548
00:38:31,685 --> 00:38:32,811
Mistake.

549
00:38:32,936 --> 00:38:34,021
Really?

550
00:38:34,146 --> 00:38:38,108
And who will prove
it's a mistake or a scam?

551
00:38:41,111 --> 00:38:42,279
I'll prove it, Sir.

552
00:38:43,196 --> 00:38:46,074
You'd better, Raina Parulekar.

553
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:47,784
You'd better.

554
00:39:08,513 --> 00:39:11,016
At times, one has to lose to win,

555
00:39:11,767 --> 00:39:14,811
and that player is 
 the ultimate winner.

556
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:22,611
Raina Parulekar, someone
has conned your company

557
00:39:22,694 --> 00:39:24,279
and sold a fake
Hussain painting to you.

558
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:25,447
How are you feeling?

559
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:27,449
There is speculation that
it's not a con but a scam,

560
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:29,159
and you are involved in it too.

561
00:39:30,243 --> 00:39:32,996
Do I look like a scamster?
Am I a thief?

562
00:39:33,872 --> 00:39:36,792
I have a B Tech degree from IIT,
and an MBA from IIM.

563
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,294
Raina, don't, let the lawyers handle it.

564
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:40,879
No, Sir, let me speak.

565
00:39:43,131 --> 00:39:45,759
I am an honest employee
of Synergy Communications.

566
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:49,638
I love this job and my company.

567
00:39:50,305 --> 00:39:52,557
I will never con my bosses,

568
00:39:53,183 --> 00:39:54,810
I've been conned.

569
00:39:55,894 --> 00:39:58,146
A man called Deven Shah has conned me.

570
00:39:58,522 --> 00:40:01,483
Surely this is not his 
 real name or his first con.

571
00:40:01,942 --> 00:40:04,361
For him, it was just a way 
 to make a quick buck.

572
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:06,279
But for me,

573
00:40:06,947 --> 00:40:09,950
my honesty, my identity, 
 my commitment,

574
00:40:10,075 --> 00:40:12,285
my job, my future all is at stake.

575
00:40:12,369 --> 00:40:14,371
I am going to track him down, 
 recover the company's money,

576
00:40:14,538 --> 00:40:18,875
get him arrested and prove  
 that he is a criminal and I am innocent.

577
00:40:29,594 --> 00:40:30,679
Yeah?

578
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:32,097
Raina from Mumbai?

579
00:40:33,348 --> 00:40:34,432
Who is this?

580
00:40:34,516 --> 00:40:35,725
Dimple from Delhi.

581
00:40:35,809 --> 00:40:37,769
You have the wrong Raina,
I don't know any Dimple.

582
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:39,729
Parulkar isn't it? Raina Parulkar.

583
00:40:41,273 --> 00:40:42,482
-Parulekar.
-Yeah, the same.

584
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:43,900
Saw you on the news,

585
00:40:44,025 --> 00:40:45,318
got your number from the channel.

586
00:40:45,402 --> 00:40:49,114
I have strong feeling
the guy who conned you

587
00:40:49,197 --> 00:40:50,407
conned me too.

588
00:41:06,631 --> 00:41:07,716
Yes, Raina.

589
00:41:08,842 --> 00:41:11,303
Yes, Deven Shah is Sunny Singh.

590
00:41:11,386 --> 00:41:13,805
Did he also make you his
girlfriend and dump you?

591
00:41:13,889 --> 00:41:15,807
I am stupid, but not that much.

592
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:17,184
You mean I am stupid?

593
00:41:17,267 --> 00:41:18,977
No, no. I mean...

594
00:41:19,144 --> 00:41:20,645
I didn't let it get to that.

595
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:23,148
But he conned me for 60 lakhs.

596
00:41:23,231 --> 00:41:26,818
Lol! 60! He could only get 20 from me.

597
00:41:26,943 --> 00:41:28,528
You are more stupid than I am.

598
00:41:28,612 --> 00:41:31,615
Okay, I am more stupid than you.

599
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:35,493
Okay, listen I am getting another call.

600
00:41:35,619 --> 00:41:36,870
I'll call you back.

601
00:41:38,997 --> 00:41:40,081
Hello?

602
00:41:40,165 --> 00:41:42,500
Hello? Is that Raina?

603
00:41:43,335 --> 00:41:44,294
Yes?

604
00:41:44,961 --> 00:41:48,215
Can we talk? I hope 
 you're not in the office?

605
00:41:49,299 --> 00:41:50,467
No, I am at home.

606
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:53,762
Have those horrible people fired you?

607
00:41:55,347 --> 00:41:58,141
Who are you? Questions upon questions.

608
00:41:58,225 --> 00:41:59,601
Where are you calling from?

609
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:03,939
Lucknow. My name is Saira.
Saira Rashid.

610
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:07,317
Six months ago, a man named Iqbal Khan

611
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,945
cheated me of 10 lakh rupees.

612
00:42:10,028 --> 00:42:11,655
and he disappeared thereafter.

613
00:42:12,155 --> 00:42:15,700
I'm not sure if Iqbal and
your painting guy are the same.

614
00:42:16,451 --> 00:42:18,161
But if you could tell me more...

615
00:42:18,245 --> 00:42:19,621
Saira, I am going to send you a photo.

616
00:42:19,704 --> 00:42:22,207
Have a look and then we'll talk.

617
00:42:29,589 --> 00:42:31,508
-Hello, Raina?
-And Dimple Chadda.

618
00:42:31,591 --> 00:42:34,636
Saira, I am Raina, and on the
other line is Dimple from Delhi.

619
00:42:34,803 --> 00:42:37,847
Dimple, did Iqbal con you as well?

620
00:42:37,931 --> 00:42:40,308
Yes, as Sunny Singh.
Did you get the photo?

621
00:42:40,517 --> 00:42:42,477
Yes, it is Iqbal.

622
00:42:42,727 --> 00:42:45,021
I took it. It's useful isn't it?

623
00:42:45,522 --> 00:42:47,357
You are really smart Dimple.

624
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,942
Raina? Did you hear that?

625
00:42:49,276 --> 00:42:51,027
Saira, tell me the truth,

626
00:42:51,236 --> 00:42:53,196
did he make you his
girlfriend as well?

627
00:42:53,822 --> 00:42:55,573
If you give Saira a chance to speak

628
00:42:55,699 --> 00:42:58,285
then she can tell us. Tell us, Saira.

629
00:42:59,494 --> 00:43:03,164
Immediately after my graduation,
I was married off to Adil.

630
00:43:03,248 --> 00:43:05,333
You're married? Love marriage?

631
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:07,711
Arranged.

632
00:43:08,461 --> 00:43:13,216
After three years Adil
died in an accident.

633
00:43:14,426 --> 00:43:17,137
His parents are just as nice as he was.

634
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:20,473
I've been with them
for the last two years.

635
00:43:20,557 --> 00:43:21,975
So when did you meet Sunny?

636
00:43:22,684 --> 00:43:24,144
While going to my shop in the morning.

637
00:43:24,269 --> 00:43:26,938
Stop, stop.

638
00:43:29,691 --> 00:43:31,901
No hell would break lose if you stop.

639
00:43:40,493 --> 00:43:42,454
Hey, don't touch them.

640
00:43:44,122 --> 00:43:45,749
I picked them.

641
00:43:46,041 --> 00:43:48,877
I missed my bus. You can't enjoy them.

642
00:43:49,294 --> 00:43:50,754
No way.

643
00:44:12,901 --> 00:44:14,694
They look so yummy,

644
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:16,946
but taste like poison.

645
00:44:24,829 --> 00:44:26,289
Ticket!

646
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:27,832
Pass!

647
00:44:27,916 --> 00:44:29,459
Don't say it, show it.

648
00:44:33,713 --> 00:44:35,757
What happened? Has the pass failed?

649
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,300
I left my purse at home.

650
00:44:37,717 --> 00:44:39,427
Show your pass, or buy a ticket.

651
00:44:40,553 --> 00:44:42,305
I don't have money,
I'll give it you tomorrow.

652
00:44:42,472 --> 00:44:43,723
I always take this route.

653
00:44:43,807 --> 00:44:45,725
Madam, get a ticket or else get off.

654
00:44:46,976 --> 00:44:49,187
Should I buy one? Ticket?

655
00:44:50,438 --> 00:44:52,190
I am already insulted.

656
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,026
I don't want to be a beggar now.

657
00:44:55,110 --> 00:44:57,529
Return it tomorrow,
I will also take this route.

658
00:45:01,032 --> 00:45:02,158
Hazrat Ganj.

659
00:45:02,242 --> 00:45:03,451
Two for Hazrat Ganj.

660
00:45:05,078 --> 00:45:06,955
Even my business is that side.

661
00:45:37,402 --> 00:45:38,528
Thank you.

662
00:45:38,611 --> 00:45:39,696
Mention not.

663
00:45:58,965 --> 00:46:00,091
One for Hazrat Ganj.

664
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:06,723
Give it to him please.

665
00:46:06,806 --> 00:46:07,891
And yours?

666
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:13,104
Take it.

667
00:46:13,188 --> 00:46:14,314
She bought it.

668
00:46:15,356 --> 00:46:16,441
Thank you!

669
00:46:16,524 --> 00:46:17,692
Mention not!

670
00:46:23,156 --> 00:46:25,074
He had done his research.

671
00:46:25,158 --> 00:46:28,244
From which bus stop, 
 and at what time I take the bus.

672
00:46:28,328 --> 00:46:32,290
Which area the shop is in, 
 what time it opens, everything.

673
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:45,553
I want pink color salwar along with this.

674
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:49,390
By buying of the ticket, 
 and the thank you, the mention not,

675
00:46:49,724 --> 00:46:52,268
he got familiar with me, 
 and soon reached our lane.

676
00:46:58,066 --> 00:46:59,234
Hey, listen.

677
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:01,236
Shambhu, take the payments.

678
00:47:02,987 --> 00:47:04,447
Hey, Mr. Suitcase?

679
00:47:07,408 --> 00:47:08,618
Blue shirt?

680
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:14,499
My mind had glazed over, I smiled 
 and led him right into the shop.

681
00:47:15,124 --> 00:47:18,127
Royal Cloth Merchant. Our shop's name.

682
00:47:18,586 --> 00:47:19,671
My name is Iqbal.

683
00:47:20,171 --> 00:47:21,381
I am Saira.

684
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:25,134
What's the rate?

685
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:26,469
Rupees 450 a meter.

686
00:47:26,553 --> 00:47:28,888
He even chose the right time 
 to enter the shop.

687
00:47:29,013 --> 00:47:30,181
-Greetings.
-Greetings.

688
00:47:30,265 --> 00:47:32,850
He knew my father-in-law brings 
 lunch at that time.

689
00:47:33,268 --> 00:47:35,436
Just as father entered, 
 he began showing off

690
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:36,938
his knowledge about fabrics.

691
00:47:37,355 --> 00:47:39,399
-Khan, Iqbal Khan.
 -It took him hardly ten minutes

692
00:47:39,482 --> 00:47:42,277
to have my father 
 wrapped around his finger.

693
00:47:43,278 --> 00:47:45,321
Tie-dye is popular here?

694
00:47:45,613 --> 00:47:48,366
Yes. There's an entire colony
for the tie-dye.

695
00:47:48,783 --> 00:47:50,118
Which way would that colony be?

696
00:47:50,285 --> 00:47:54,706
It's through the by lanes,
you'll get lost if you go on your own.

697
00:47:54,914 --> 00:47:58,418
I would've shown you, had the
property tax guy not been coming.

698
00:47:59,294 --> 00:48:01,296
Saira why don't you show him?

699
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:02,839
Me?

700
00:48:02,922 --> 00:48:05,508
Yes, go ahead. I'll manage here.

701
00:48:07,302 --> 00:48:08,386
Okay.

702
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:13,975
While he was showing his 
 fake sympathy and kindness,

703
00:48:14,058 --> 00:48:17,604
I was melting like an idiot.

704
00:48:18,396 --> 00:48:19,522
Cold drink?

705
00:48:20,106 --> 00:48:21,232
Ice cream?

706
00:48:30,408 --> 00:48:31,951
Shall I show you something?

707
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:38,791
God, finally the Pandora's box
is opening today.

708
00:48:40,168 --> 00:48:41,252
What is this?

709
00:48:41,336 --> 00:48:43,087
Real intricate threadwork Zardozi.

710
00:48:43,171 --> 00:48:45,715
I've never seen such
intricate work before.

711
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:47,759
We have our own workshop in Bareli,

712
00:48:48,676 --> 00:48:50,136
traditional weavers.

713
00:48:52,555 --> 00:48:54,599
As there are no
sales in smaller towns,

714
00:48:55,308 --> 00:48:58,686
my friends said that
Lucknow would be the right place.

715
00:49:00,355 --> 00:49:03,524
Now, the dealers here
show interest but not cash.

716
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:08,780
I am almost through
with the money I had.

717
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:15,662
Back home my mother
and both my sisters are worried.

718
00:49:17,413 --> 00:49:20,500
I'd better head back home.

719
00:49:23,419 --> 00:49:25,088
Isn't it exquisite?

720
00:49:27,298 --> 00:49:28,883
What are you quoting for this?

721
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:30,343
Four rupees a meter.

722
00:49:30,426 --> 00:49:33,721
No one is ready to pay
even 400. Such swindlers!

723
00:49:33,805 --> 00:49:35,598
And they will sell it for a 1,000.

724
00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:38,476
Your losses won't be a profit to us!

725
00:49:39,894 --> 00:49:41,938
But 400 is too low, my friend.

726
00:49:42,522 --> 00:49:44,440
I'll give you 500 rupees a meter

727
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:46,943
And I'll place an
order for 5,000 meters.

728
00:49:47,485 --> 00:49:51,072
I'll give you ten lakhs advance
and the balance of 15 lakhs on delivery.

729
00:49:51,155 --> 00:49:52,281
Agreed?

730
00:49:52,365 --> 00:49:55,702
Poor father, he struck 
 the deal blindly for me.

731
00:49:56,077 --> 00:49:57,870
Hoping that this friendship would

732
00:49:57,995 --> 00:50:00,957
turn into a relationship, 
 and end my loneliness.

733
00:50:01,124 --> 00:50:03,543
Have some sweets to celebrate.

734
00:50:03,626 --> 00:50:04,711
Wow.

735
00:50:04,836 --> 00:50:07,296
The following day,  
 father gave him 10 lakhs, cash.

736
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:09,757
He promised to 
 return in two weeks' time.

737
00:50:09,966 --> 00:50:13,553
I feel like wringing the Zardozi Saree
around his neck

738
00:50:14,095 --> 00:50:16,180
and hang him in the city center.

739
00:50:16,347 --> 00:50:18,808
That's provided we find him.

740
00:50:19,142 --> 00:50:23,563
You guys have his photo
why don't you inform the police?

741
00:50:24,313 --> 00:50:26,774
If he gets to know the
police are looking for him

742
00:50:26,858 --> 00:50:29,694
he will go underground,
and we will never get our money.

743
00:50:30,278 --> 00:50:31,571
No. No police.

744
00:50:32,697 --> 00:50:34,365
Look, I have a plan.

745
00:50:35,366 --> 00:50:37,827
Everything will be
possible if we join forces.

746
00:50:38,244 --> 00:50:39,537
Why don't both of you come down?

747
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:40,997
It's impossible for me.

748
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:43,791
Papa has imposed various bans on me.

749
00:50:43,875 --> 00:50:46,461
Fine then sit in your homes,

750
00:50:46,544 --> 00:50:49,172
and let more Sunnys and
Iqbals make fools out of you.

751
00:50:49,756 --> 00:50:50,840
Bye.

752
00:51:07,857 --> 00:51:08,941
Go.

753
00:51:12,695 --> 00:51:14,363
It has been bothering me too.

754
00:51:16,115 --> 00:51:19,619
But then I didn't say anything
thinking about Adil.

755
00:51:20,912 --> 00:51:22,246
I was wrong.

756
00:51:22,872 --> 00:51:25,541
But even if Adil is not here anymore,
you are.

757
00:51:29,378 --> 00:51:32,548
No, you are not going on any trip.

758
00:51:32,673 --> 00:51:34,717
Gurmi, Puchki, Choti are all going.

759
00:51:36,385 --> 00:51:39,972
Well, no bodybuilder in their house
has swindled them of 20 lakhs.

760
00:51:40,431 --> 00:51:41,766
If I have done something wrong once

761
00:51:41,849 --> 00:51:43,267
it doesn't mean that
I'll be doing it all my life.

762
00:51:43,351 --> 00:51:45,019
Even you have made many mistakes.

763
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:48,898
Weren't you conned in the
Bhatia shop deal, for 12 Lakhs?

764
00:51:48,981 --> 00:51:51,442
The Pancholi Bunglaow,
the Preet Vihar flats,

765
00:51:51,567 --> 00:51:54,111
but did you shut down your property
business because of your mistakes?

766
00:51:54,237 --> 00:51:55,988
You've grounded me!

767
00:51:56,239 --> 00:51:59,659
I never thought you'd play such a
double standard game with me, Papa.

768
00:52:02,286 --> 00:52:03,746
Let her go.

769
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:12,964
Dimpy, will you travel
business class or economy?

770
00:52:24,976 --> 00:52:26,102
Raina!

771
00:52:27,144 --> 00:52:28,229
Dimple?

772
00:52:28,312 --> 00:52:30,273
Come on, I've been waiting for so long.

773
00:52:30,356 --> 00:52:31,482
But I was right here.

774
00:52:31,566 --> 00:52:33,776
But you didn't come in front of me.

775
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:35,528
Okay, sorry.

776
00:52:37,196 --> 00:52:38,281
Nice glares.

777
00:52:38,614 --> 00:52:39,740
Aren't they?

778
00:52:47,123 --> 00:52:49,000
Are you still in mourning for Sunny?

779
00:52:49,083 --> 00:52:50,167
No.

780
00:52:50,251 --> 00:52:51,544
So why black-black?

781
00:52:52,295 --> 00:52:53,379
I like black.

782
00:52:53,462 --> 00:52:54,547
I like colour.

783
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:56,299
Suits you.

784
00:52:57,133 --> 00:52:58,968
Saira's flight arrived before yours.

785
00:52:59,051 --> 00:53:01,137
She hasn't even
switched on her phone yet.

786
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:03,139
I am Saira

787
00:53:05,933 --> 00:53:07,435
You run a shop?

788
00:53:08,978 --> 00:53:10,062
Yes, Dimple.

789
00:53:10,688 --> 00:53:11,772
Hello, Raina.

790
00:53:11,856 --> 00:53:12,982
Hello.

791
00:53:21,282 --> 00:53:22,408
Let's go.

792
00:53:23,951 --> 00:53:25,494
How did you guess I was Dimple?

793
00:53:25,828 --> 00:53:29,123
You're very special,
people know you instantly.

794
00:53:39,091 --> 00:53:42,428
Okay so how will we
get our money from Sunny?

795
00:53:42,845 --> 00:53:43,930
From Iqbal.

796
00:53:44,055 --> 00:53:47,516
Dev, Iqbal, Sunny whatever
from that Bloody Scoundrel.

797
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:50,603
Idea. His name will
be Bloody Scoundrel

798
00:53:50,686 --> 00:53:51,979
to avoid any confusion.

799
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:55,358
To extract money from
the Bloody Scoundrel

800
00:53:55,441 --> 00:53:57,151
we will con that con.

801
00:53:58,277 --> 00:54:00,279
Con what con?

802
00:54:03,074 --> 00:54:04,909
Con means to cheat.

803
00:54:05,701 --> 00:54:09,038
He cheated us, now we will cheat him.

804
00:54:09,121 --> 00:54:11,958
We will plant a bait in front of him.

805
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:14,585
Our bait will pretend
that she has a great

806
00:54:14,669 --> 00:54:18,756
investment proposal to multiply money.

807
00:54:18,839 --> 00:54:21,926
Bloody Scoundrel will
invest his money in that,

808
00:54:22,218 --> 00:54:24,887
and through our bait we
will get our money back.

809
00:54:26,681 --> 00:54:27,807
Simple.

810
00:54:28,099 --> 00:54:30,893
Simple? Who will be 'The Bait'?

811
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:32,144
There is one.

812
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:35,606
I have someone in mind.

813
00:54:58,963 --> 00:55:00,715
Through the thorns

814
00:55:00,798 --> 00:55:02,675
Pluck the roses

815
00:55:03,050 --> 00:55:06,762
Snip the dreams,  
 From te tree of snoozes

816
00:55:09,849 --> 00:55:12,309
Through the thorns

817
00:55:12,435 --> 00:55:14,145
Pluck the roses

818
00:55:14,478 --> 00:55:18,107
Snip the dreams,  
 From te tree of snoozes

819
00:55:18,399 --> 00:55:21,986
Many a tales of hopes to look

820
00:55:22,278 --> 00:55:26,157
Pick any story and leave the book

821
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:29,952
Faded are the colors of life

822
00:55:30,077 --> 00:55:33,831
Follow your heart all the way through

823
00:55:33,914 --> 00:55:36,459
Till it changes your point of view

824
00:55:36,584 --> 00:55:40,129
Let out your passion

825
00:55:40,254 --> 00:55:43,841
Let out your passion

826
00:55:44,258 --> 00:55:47,803
Let out your passion

827
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:12,536
Let out your passion

828
00:56:12,703 --> 00:56:17,249
Let out your passion

829
00:56:31,639 --> 00:56:35,810
Pat a little

830
00:56:36,143 --> 00:56:39,647
Awaken your lazy dreams

831
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:43,609
It's your play

832
00:56:43,692 --> 00:56:47,363
Fight through the difficult way

833
00:56:47,571 --> 00:56:49,448
What will be, will be

834
00:56:49,532 --> 00:56:51,492
Don't worry you will see

835
00:56:51,575 --> 00:56:55,329
Restrain not your dreams

836
00:56:55,538 --> 00:56:59,041
Ride the waves of destiny

837
00:56:59,208 --> 00:57:03,003
Just sail out your boat and go

838
00:57:03,212 --> 00:57:06,006
Even your stars will shine and glow

839
00:57:13,264 --> 00:57:16,892
Let out your passion

840
00:57:17,101 --> 00:57:20,437
Let out your passion

841
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:24,733
Let out your passion

842
00:57:51,302 --> 00:57:52,970
Cabinets up, cabinets down.

843
00:57:53,095 --> 00:57:54,889
Cabinets down, cabinets up.

844
00:57:54,972 --> 00:57:56,891
Lots and lots of cabinets.

845
00:57:57,183 --> 00:57:59,935
Everything in its cabinet,
in its place.

846
00:58:00,019 --> 00:58:02,980
After chasing targets
in the office all day,

847
00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:05,441
you don't want to chase the
boxes of rice and curry at home?

848
00:58:05,983 --> 00:58:08,986
Perfect modular kitchen for
a perfect professional couple.

849
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:11,614
Sir, you just need
to choose the color,

850
00:58:11,739 --> 00:58:13,741
our engineers will fit every piece.

851
00:58:13,824 --> 00:58:15,284
They can even cook
if you want them to...

852
00:58:15,367 --> 00:58:17,244
But I can't guarantee the taste.

853
00:58:18,078 --> 00:58:20,831
Like I said,
HomeTown makes life beautiful.

854
00:58:20,998 --> 00:58:23,626
When you get promoted
please invite me to dinner.

855
00:58:23,834 --> 00:58:25,878
Sudesh will help you.

856
00:58:25,961 --> 00:58:27,379
Please pay at the counter.

857
00:58:27,463 --> 00:58:28,547
Thank you.

858
00:58:30,382 --> 00:58:31,467
Hello.

859
00:58:31,550 --> 00:58:33,010
-Raina, Ma'am.
-Hey.

860
00:58:34,053 --> 00:58:36,639
Wow, you are glowing...

861
00:58:36,972 --> 00:58:39,391
I know, I know. The sensex
must have gone up like a rocket.

862
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:40,684
How much profit have you booked for?

863
00:58:40,809 --> 00:58:42,436
Celebrating again? Perfect.

864
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:44,271
We've just received
exquisite wine glasses from Venice.

865
00:58:44,355 --> 00:58:45,773
Hand blown glass. What a finish.

866
00:58:45,856 --> 00:58:48,192
Even Indian wine
tastes like French in it.

867
00:58:48,275 --> 00:58:49,693
No, Ishika, I don't need...

868
00:58:49,777 --> 00:58:52,988
No no, you can't repeat
glasses from the last party.

869
00:58:53,072 --> 00:58:55,324
What will your guests think?
Raina is such a miser!

870
00:58:55,491 --> 00:58:58,535
I'm so sorry, your friends?

871
00:58:58,661 --> 00:59:00,412
Hi, I am Ishika and you are?

872
00:59:00,579 --> 00:59:02,081
Saira.

873
00:59:02,206 --> 00:59:03,290
Dimple Chaddha.

874
00:59:03,666 --> 00:59:06,335
Dimple, dude, I have
just the right thing for you.

875
00:59:06,418 --> 00:59:09,546
Ma'am, I will just attend to her,
and then the glasses.

876
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:29,483
Peeler, slicer, chopper, masher,
all in one. Cool, isn't it?

877
00:59:29,733 --> 00:59:32,653
Very cool, but what are
you going to do with it?

878
00:59:33,696 --> 00:59:38,659
Me?

879
00:59:41,328 --> 00:59:42,579
You were right,

880
00:59:43,831 --> 00:59:45,082
she is awesome.

881
00:59:48,669 --> 00:59:49,753
Bloody chameleon.

882
00:59:55,676 --> 00:59:56,760
Return seven rupees.

883
00:59:56,844 --> 00:59:59,013
No change, if you guys
get so petty then...

884
00:59:59,096 --> 01:00:00,222
You guys means?

885
01:00:00,431 --> 01:00:01,682
My money hangs off tress?

886
01:00:02,099 --> 01:00:03,183
Hey, Ishika!

887
01:00:05,019 --> 01:00:06,145
Raina, Ma'am.

888
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:07,855
Get out.

889
01:00:19,283 --> 01:00:21,577
Will you keep eating? Say something

890
01:00:22,828 --> 01:00:23,912
Coffee please.

891
01:00:24,038 --> 01:00:25,164
Yes, Ma'am.

892
01:00:31,128 --> 01:00:32,671
Frankly, I am not surprised.

893
01:00:33,422 --> 01:00:37,259
It's so easy to con you guys,
check out the bills from yesterday.

894
01:00:37,384 --> 01:00:39,845
We bought it only to check you out.

895
01:00:40,137 --> 01:00:42,306
Fine, agreed about yesterday.

896
01:00:43,098 --> 01:00:44,725
I con Raina every week,

897
01:00:45,559 --> 01:00:46,727
and you get conned.

898
01:00:47,186 --> 01:00:50,522
Till yesterday we were "Ma'am"
and today we are first names?

899
01:00:50,606 --> 01:00:53,901
If we work together we will be
equals right, then why "ma'am"?

900
01:00:53,984 --> 01:00:55,110
So are you doing it?

901
01:00:56,028 --> 01:00:57,196
"If" I do it.

902
01:00:59,365 --> 01:01:00,783
How much time will it take?

903
01:01:01,492 --> 01:01:02,659
A month or two.

904
01:01:03,243 --> 01:01:06,330
No way, I've finished my paid leave.

905
01:01:06,663 --> 01:01:08,624
To do this I'll have to take time off.

906
01:01:09,166 --> 01:01:10,793
I get paid 30 thousand a month.

907
01:01:11,001 --> 01:01:13,670
Five lakhs. Your fee.

908
01:01:14,254 --> 01:01:15,839
All expenses paid.

909
01:01:23,514 --> 01:01:25,099
What if he is a psycho-rapist?

910
01:01:25,182 --> 01:01:26,642
He is not a rapist.

911
01:01:27,184 --> 01:01:28,477
Actually, he is very nice.

912
01:01:28,769 --> 01:01:31,897
He is only interested in money.
Cold calculated unemotional.

913
01:01:32,272 --> 01:01:35,692
What pain his con causes
is no concern to him.

914
01:01:39,405 --> 01:01:41,073
I am doing my job well...

915
01:01:41,824 --> 01:01:43,158
Getting paid well,

916
01:01:44,034 --> 01:01:45,327
no one to check on me.

917
01:01:46,995 --> 01:01:48,247
Con a con?

918
01:01:48,330 --> 01:01:50,332
-Let it be. Excuse me.
-Fine.

919
01:01:51,625 --> 01:01:52,668
I will do it.

920
01:01:54,253 --> 01:01:57,714
Yes, let's show that scoundrel
what pain means.

921
01:01:58,048 --> 01:02:01,301
But how will we find the scoundrel?

922
01:02:01,385 --> 01:02:04,680
That you leave to Raina!

923
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:12,521
This number is issued to
Anjum Rizwi not Sunny Singh.

924
01:02:12,855 --> 01:02:15,816
Delhi, prepaid, March last year.

925
01:02:17,067 --> 01:02:19,486
Check this. Lucknow, October.

926
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:25,701
Parampal Yadav. Not Iqbal Khan. Prepaid.

927
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:28,203
And this one?

928
01:02:31,373 --> 01:02:33,041
Prepaid. Mumbai.

929
01:02:33,625 --> 01:02:34,710
October.

930
01:02:35,043 --> 01:02:36,170
Rahul Khanna.

931
01:02:36,253 --> 01:02:38,755
Hopeless, they are all different names,

932
01:02:38,839 --> 01:02:40,466
how can we find him like this?

933
01:02:40,549 --> 01:02:41,717
Patience, sweety.

934
01:02:42,593 --> 01:02:43,760
You're Bournvita.

935
01:02:43,844 --> 01:02:46,138
Okay, now the three numbers
have the same caller tune.

936
01:02:46,221 --> 01:02:48,098
At times, one has to lose to win,

937
01:02:48,223 --> 01:02:49,391
and that player is
the ultimate winner.

938
01:02:49,475 --> 01:02:50,559
So what?

939
01:02:50,642 --> 01:02:52,102
Most people choose songs.

940
01:02:52,186 --> 01:02:54,188
Very few ring tones have dialogues.

941
01:02:54,688 --> 01:03:00,527
Now you get a list of all
prepaid numbers with this caller tune.

942
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:03,614
Let's see how ultimate a winner you are.

943
01:03:04,364 --> 01:03:06,992
Raina Ma'am, you are wicked!

944
01:03:16,251 --> 01:03:18,337
Ladies, wake up.

945
01:03:19,338 --> 01:03:20,797
Here is your list,

946
01:03:21,256 --> 01:03:22,508
it has seven names.

947
01:03:25,636 --> 01:03:29,389
All the best, I hope in the
Ladies vs. Bloody Scoundrel,

948
01:03:29,473 --> 01:03:31,934
the Scoundrel loses
and the ladies win.

949
01:03:32,059 --> 01:03:33,143
Thank you, bye-bye.

950
01:03:36,063 --> 01:03:37,147
Ready?

951
01:03:38,524 --> 01:03:39,608
Bismillah.

952
01:03:40,317 --> 01:03:41,652
First name,

953
01:03:41,735 --> 01:03:47,533
Amandeep Chandigarh. 9915682870.

954
01:03:49,785 --> 01:03:51,036
It's ringing...

955
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:52,204
Hello?

956
01:03:52,287 --> 01:03:53,914
Amandeep you're a guy or a girl?

957
01:03:53,997 --> 01:03:55,415
You're an aunty or an uncle?

958
01:03:55,499 --> 01:03:57,668
-Your dad's the uncle!
-Dimple.

959
01:03:58,085 --> 01:03:59,753
No speaking. Just listen.

960
01:04:00,170 --> 01:04:01,547
Takes all sorts.

961
01:04:01,922 --> 01:04:03,048
Next.

962
01:04:04,508 --> 01:04:06,301
Hello? Who is it?

963
01:04:08,220 --> 01:04:09,805
Shailen Sharma, Bilaspur.

964
01:04:11,056 --> 01:04:12,724
Has the consignment arrived?

965
01:04:14,434 --> 01:04:15,727
Diego Vaz. Goa.

966
01:04:16,270 --> 01:04:18,855
I'll do it, she can't even dial.
Never gets through.

967
01:04:19,273 --> 01:04:23,235
9850008326.

968
01:04:29,950 --> 01:04:32,286
So what? You didn't get
through the first time either.

969
01:04:32,369 --> 01:04:33,537
Next.

970
01:04:35,539 --> 01:04:37,249
Where are you hiding, Scoundrel?

971
01:04:47,718 --> 01:04:49,928
The fourth guy Dimple
called is calling back.

972
01:04:50,012 --> 01:04:51,138
Diego Vaz.

973
01:04:53,098 --> 01:04:58,729
Hello?

974
01:05:05,235 --> 01:05:06,903
The Bloody Scoundrel is in Goa!

975
01:06:25,399 --> 01:06:26,566
This is your planning?

976
01:06:27,234 --> 01:06:30,362
Had we told Papa, he would've
booked us into a five-star hotel.

977
01:06:30,904 --> 01:06:35,409
Miss Dimple, I wish your papa
had financed this entire operation.

978
01:06:35,867 --> 01:06:37,202
We would've stayed in a five-star hotel,

979
01:06:37,285 --> 01:06:38,954
hired a Mercedes. Thank you.

980
01:06:39,037 --> 01:06:42,624
But I'm very sorry, this is all I could
manage with my small savings.

981
01:06:42,708 --> 01:06:45,043
Ishika's fee, food, transport,

982
01:06:45,127 --> 01:06:47,087
everyone's tickets, chips, cold drinks.

983
01:06:47,170 --> 01:06:48,922
But it's not an obligation, right,

984
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:50,215
once we get money from that
Bloody Scoundrel...

985
01:06:50,298 --> 01:06:51,133
Volume!

986
01:06:51,216 --> 01:06:52,843
When we get the money
from Bloody Scoundrel,

987
01:06:52,926 --> 01:06:56,138
you will take your cut first
and then give us ours, right?

988
01:06:58,014 --> 01:06:59,766
If we get and when we get.

989
01:07:00,434 --> 01:07:01,601
And what if we don't?

990
01:07:02,978 --> 01:07:04,479
Don't be negative.

991
01:07:05,021 --> 01:07:06,314
It's going to be fine.

992
01:07:07,816 --> 01:07:08,942
God willing.

993
01:07:10,861 --> 01:07:14,948
Wow, what a great bed.

994
01:07:15,115 --> 01:07:17,325
The two of us can fit in easily.

995
01:07:18,076 --> 01:07:19,161
That room.

996
01:07:19,619 --> 01:07:21,538
Why? Aren't we roomies?

997
01:07:21,621 --> 01:07:25,083
Sweetie, first you stop snoring
then you and I can be roomies.

998
01:07:25,250 --> 01:07:26,585
Till then, Saira and I are here.

999
01:07:26,668 --> 01:07:27,961
Okay, rules:

1000
01:07:28,837 --> 01:07:31,047
This is my friend Sasha's house,
not a hotel.

1001
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:36,386
We have to leave it in a
better condition than it is now.

1002
01:07:37,721 --> 01:07:39,639
The maid comes in
the morning to clean,

1003
01:07:39,723 --> 01:07:42,017
but no one says
anything in front of her.

1004
01:07:42,642 --> 01:07:46,688
The rest of the work will be
divided equally between us.

1005
01:07:46,772 --> 01:07:47,731
Okay?

1006
01:07:47,939 --> 01:07:51,193
Why didn't you specify earlier
that we'd have to be maids as well?

1007
01:07:51,276 --> 01:07:52,694
Change the SIM card.

1008
01:07:54,529 --> 01:07:56,406
Don't even know how to change a card.

1009
01:07:56,615 --> 01:07:59,493
That's why you're still a Manager
and not General Manager.

1010
01:08:04,790 --> 01:08:07,042
At times, one has to lose to win,

1011
01:08:07,667 --> 01:08:09,711
and that player is the ultimate winner.

1012
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:11,004
Yeah?

1013
01:08:11,671 --> 01:08:15,717
Hello, I have a problem with my laptop

1014
01:08:15,801 --> 01:08:19,638
and I was wondering
when I could come by to get it fixed.

1015
01:08:19,721 --> 01:08:20,806
Wrong number.

1016
01:08:20,889 --> 01:08:24,476
Hello, hello Ashley?
Ashley Rodriguez?

1017
01:08:24,559 --> 01:08:27,437
I am not Ashley Rodriguez. 
 I am Diego Vaz.

1018
01:08:27,521 --> 01:08:30,565
But my friend gave me this number

1019
01:08:30,649 --> 01:08:33,985
and told me you're
very good with computers.

1020
01:08:34,069 --> 01:08:36,613
You live in Cavelossim, right?

1021
01:08:36,696 --> 01:08:38,323
I don't fix computers, ma'am.

1022
01:08:38,406 --> 01:08:40,116
I work at the water
sports shack at The Pallazzo.

1023
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:41,284
If you'd like to...

1024
01:08:44,162 --> 01:08:45,288
Let's go.

1025
01:09:28,331 --> 01:09:30,166
What a body.

1026
01:10:50,038 --> 01:10:51,831
Oh, excuse me.

1027
01:10:51,915 --> 01:10:53,083
Yes, ma'am?

1028
01:10:53,166 --> 01:10:55,543
Can you give
me a dry towel, Mr. Shankar?

1029
01:10:56,086 --> 01:10:57,295
-Sure, ma'am.
-Thank you.

1030
01:11:13,728 --> 01:11:15,855
Come on, come on,
come on. Keys! The keys.

1031
01:11:15,939 --> 01:11:17,482
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

1032
01:11:19,317 --> 01:11:21,111
Dimple, you can drive, right?

1033
01:11:21,236 --> 01:11:23,154
-Drive? I'll fly.
-Open it.

1034
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:05,697
Just look.

1035
01:12:06,197 --> 01:12:07,699
The result of all his crimes.

1036
01:12:08,074 --> 01:12:10,702
House, fridge, microwave, TV,
he has everything.

1037
01:12:11,578 --> 01:12:12,662
Yet he seems lonely,

1038
01:12:13,621 --> 01:12:15,874
not even a soul to
share a meal with him.

1039
01:12:16,750 --> 01:12:18,460
How do we know there is no one?

1040
01:12:18,585 --> 01:12:19,627
No!

1041
01:12:20,086 --> 01:12:21,838
He's never getting into that trap.

1042
01:12:21,921 --> 01:12:25,258
Then what is he is doing here alone
with all our money?

1043
01:12:25,633 --> 01:12:27,510
Looking for another victim I guess.

1044
01:12:28,094 --> 01:12:30,346
Had he found one,
he wouldn't have been in Goa.

1045
01:12:36,936 --> 01:12:38,354
Hello, Ishika.

1046
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:39,731
We found the Scoundrel.

1047
01:12:39,898 --> 01:12:41,566
Take the first flight out!

1048
01:13:05,298 --> 01:13:06,382
Okay.

1049
01:13:06,716 --> 01:13:09,969
So the Bloody Scoundrel,
operates from The Grand Pallazzo.

1050
01:13:10,053 --> 01:13:11,805
You will be staying there as well.

1051
01:13:12,013 --> 01:13:13,139
The story is,

1052
01:13:13,223 --> 01:13:15,433
you're the daughter of Himesh Bhai,

1053
01:13:15,517 --> 01:13:16,810
the owner of King Motels and Resorts, USA.

1054
01:13:16,935 --> 01:13:18,103
-Me?
-Ishika Patel.

1055
01:13:18,728 --> 01:13:19,813
American citizen?

1056
01:13:19,938 --> 01:13:22,732
Fake one. We aren't
really taking you to America.

1057
01:13:23,817 --> 01:13:24,984
This is their website.

1058
01:13:25,318 --> 01:13:27,654
-Real website?
-No, we've made it.

1059
01:13:27,987 --> 01:13:29,697
Himesh Bhai fake, Ishika fake,

1060
01:13:29,781 --> 01:13:31,407
Kings Motel and Resorts fake.

1061
01:13:31,491 --> 01:13:34,494
But if you Google it, a genuine-looking
website will come up.

1062
01:13:34,828 --> 01:13:36,579
Impressive homework!

1063
01:13:36,663 --> 01:13:38,623
So Himesh Bhai and family,

1064
01:13:39,165 --> 01:13:40,792
billionaire American citizens.

1065
01:13:41,626 --> 01:13:45,296
Your father Himes Bhai Patel 
 is the USA Motel King.

1066
01:13:46,047 --> 01:13:48,883
Owner of 240 motels and 60 resorts.

1067
01:14:03,731 --> 01:14:06,526
You have three brothers, all older,

1068
01:14:06,943 --> 01:14:09,195
you're the only and 
 the youngest daughter.

1069
01:14:09,654 --> 01:14:13,408
You're in Goa to set up your own business.

1070
01:14:18,121 --> 01:14:20,206
-Welcome, Ma'am.
-Thank you.

1071
01:14:28,756 --> 01:14:30,216
Have a pleasant stay.

1072
01:14:30,341 --> 01:14:31,759
-Thank you.
-Welcome, Ma'am.

1073
01:14:32,594 --> 01:14:33,678
Thank you, Ma'am.

1074
01:14:33,803 --> 01:14:37,473
A man named Shankar works here
at the bell desk.

1075
01:14:37,765 --> 01:14:38,892
Yes, Ma'am.

1076
01:14:39,225 --> 01:14:41,186
A friend of mine
stayed here last month

1077
01:14:41,269 --> 01:14:42,770
and Shankar helped her a lot,

1078
01:14:42,937 --> 01:14:44,689
can you send Shankar, please?

1079
01:14:44,981 --> 01:14:46,065
I can help, Ma'am.

1080
01:14:46,191 --> 01:14:47,984
He is Shankar, I am Bhola.

1081
01:14:48,151 --> 01:14:49,068
What do you want ma'am?

1082
01:14:49,152 --> 01:14:50,904
Ice, hash, sugar, grass?

1083
01:14:52,697 --> 01:14:53,948
Shankar!

1084
01:14:54,032 --> 01:14:55,116
Okay, Ma'am.

1085
01:14:55,909 --> 01:14:56,993
Thank you.

1086
01:15:07,462 --> 01:15:12,300
This is like a 2BHK flat.

1087
01:15:16,179 --> 01:15:17,305
My feet hurt.

1088
01:15:24,687 --> 01:15:26,189
The Alps.

1089
01:15:26,689 --> 01:15:27,815
And complimentary!

1090
01:15:30,401 --> 01:15:32,987
Ishika Patel, Patel.

1091
01:15:33,655 --> 01:15:34,781
I feel good.

1092
01:15:35,865 --> 01:15:37,325
Fifty-two inch.

1093
01:15:50,922 --> 01:15:53,299
-Yes?
-Hello, Ma'am. I'm Shankar.

1094
01:15:53,633 --> 01:15:54,759
You asked for me?

1095
01:15:55,260 --> 01:15:56,386
Right.

1096
01:15:56,970 --> 01:15:58,388
-Shankar.
-Thank you, Ma'am.

1097
01:15:58,471 --> 01:16:01,015
I need a list of all the
property dealers in Goa,

1098
01:16:01,099 --> 01:16:03,142
-the best and most reliable.
-Yes, Ma'am.

1099
01:16:03,226 --> 01:16:05,561
The ones who deal for
less than a crore rupees,

1100
01:16:05,979 --> 01:16:07,397
don't bother including them.

1101
01:16:07,647 --> 01:16:09,065
It will be a waste of time.

1102
01:16:09,148 --> 01:16:10,608
Will get it done.

1103
01:16:10,984 --> 01:16:13,820
The list will be better

1104
01:16:13,903 --> 01:16:16,322
if I know what kind of
property you are looking for...

1105
01:16:16,406 --> 01:16:18,574
Flat, bungalow, office, show room?

1106
01:16:18,658 --> 01:16:20,702
For a restaurant. My restaurant.

1107
01:16:20,910 --> 01:16:22,287
I need land for that.

1108
01:16:24,414 --> 01:16:25,748
-My card.
-Thank you, Ma'am.

1109
01:16:25,832 --> 01:16:28,042
Sorry my dad's card.

1110
01:16:28,251 --> 01:16:29,794
-Here, this is mine.
-Thank you, Ma'am.

1111
01:16:30,003 --> 01:16:32,213
Call me on my Indian number
once the list is ready.

1112
01:16:32,297 --> 01:16:33,423
-Okay, Ma'am.
-Okay?

1113
01:16:33,589 --> 01:16:34,716
Now get to work.

1114
01:16:34,799 --> 01:16:36,759
Thank you very much, ma'am,
thank you very much.

1115
01:16:36,843 --> 01:16:38,052
Have a nice day, ma'am.

1116
01:16:40,054 --> 01:16:41,180
You too...

1117
01:16:44,559 --> 01:16:47,478
Boss, I found a huge fish.

1118
01:16:47,562 --> 01:16:48,896
Ishika Patel.

1119
01:17:17,925 --> 01:17:20,053
Excuse me, one minute.

1120
01:17:20,136 --> 01:17:21,596
What're you doing?
I'm going to use this.

1121
01:17:21,721 --> 01:17:22,930
One minute, I will not take long.

1122
01:17:23,056 --> 01:17:25,725
-I will not take long.
-Okay, where's the manager?

1123
01:17:35,902 --> 01:17:37,945
He was checking
Ishika's dad's website.

1124
01:17:38,571 --> 01:17:39,864
He's hooked.

1125
01:17:40,656 --> 01:17:41,741
Ishika.

1126
01:19:03,614 --> 01:19:04,991
-Wohoo...
-Hello, Ma'am.

1127
01:19:05,074 --> 01:19:07,535
This is the property dealer's list
you asked for.

1128
01:19:07,660 --> 01:19:09,078
-You got them?
-Yes, Ma'am.

1129
01:19:09,245 --> 01:19:10,413
-Superb.
-Yeah, thank you.

1130
01:19:10,496 --> 01:19:11,330
Thank you, Shankar.

1131
01:19:11,414 --> 01:19:13,332
My pleasure, Ma'am,
and this is your ride, Ma'am.

1132
01:19:13,416 --> 01:19:14,250
-I like it.
-Yeah.

1133
01:19:14,417 --> 01:19:15,293
-I love the color.
-Yeah.

1134
01:19:15,376 --> 01:19:16,836
-Please, Ma'am.
-Thank you.

1135
01:19:18,546 --> 01:19:20,506
-Have a nice day, Ma'am.
-Thank you.

1136
01:19:39,317 --> 01:19:41,319
Dimple, stay back. Stay back.

1137
01:20:54,767 --> 01:20:55,893
He's still not here.

1138
01:20:57,645 --> 01:20:58,771
Where is he?

1139
01:20:59,355 --> 01:21:01,274
He's just been
watching for three days.

1140
01:21:01,357 --> 01:21:02,525
Why isn't he attacking?

1141
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:06,404
Do you think he has
suspected something?

1142
01:21:27,341 --> 01:21:29,427
When will he stop looking so handsome?

1143
01:21:30,511 --> 01:21:32,722
All his luxury is
thanks to all our money.

1144
01:21:33,222 --> 01:21:36,309
Don't worry, won't last too long.

1145
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:52,992
Single malt, double.

1146
01:21:53,075 --> 01:21:54,410
Sure, Sir.

1147
01:22:02,835 --> 01:22:04,420
-Yes?
-Bill our drinks to this.

1148
01:22:04,754 --> 01:22:05,880
Okay.

1149
01:22:24,106 --> 01:22:25,232
Jerks.

1150
01:22:27,026 --> 01:22:28,402
Settle my tab please.

1151
01:22:28,736 --> 01:22:29,987
-Sure, Ma'am.
-Thank you.

1152
01:22:36,035 --> 01:22:38,704
-Ma'am, your card is blocked.
-What?

1153
01:22:41,707 --> 01:22:42,917
How can it be blocked?

1154
01:22:44,168 --> 01:22:46,629
Hello? Yeah my card

1155
01:22:46,879 --> 01:22:52,551
number is 4541 9823 3318 0680.

1156
01:22:53,302 --> 01:22:55,304
How can it be blocked you block-head?

1157
01:22:55,638 --> 01:22:57,390
Unblock it. Unblock it now!

1158
01:22:57,890 --> 01:22:59,016
Twenty four hours!

1159
01:22:59,975 --> 01:23:02,186
What will I do without
my card for 24 hours?

1160
01:23:03,104 --> 01:23:06,023
You know I will sue you for this. Raina!

1161
01:23:07,233 --> 01:23:08,901
He is not even looking at me.

1162
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:11,112
Drunkard's just chugging it down.

1163
01:23:12,029 --> 01:23:13,656
I am paying cash and leaving.

1164
01:23:14,824 --> 01:23:15,908
Okay, Bye.

1165
01:23:17,618 --> 01:23:20,746
Hi, so I'm just going to pay
you by cash, how much was it?

1166
01:23:20,871 --> 01:23:23,624
It's okay, ma'am, your bill has
been settled by your friend

1167
01:23:23,708 --> 01:23:24,792
Which friend?

1168
01:23:30,005 --> 01:23:31,132
Excuse me!

1169
01:23:34,635 --> 01:23:36,637
Since when have you become my friend?

1170
01:23:38,222 --> 01:23:40,975
Since the white shirt and
blue jeans became your enemy.

1171
01:23:43,018 --> 01:23:44,937
Listen, I don't have time for this.

1172
01:23:45,020 --> 01:23:46,647
So just tell me how
much you paid for my bill?

1173
01:23:46,731 --> 01:23:49,150
Blue and white paid, not me.

1174
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:51,235
Bartender said you...

1175
01:23:51,318 --> 01:23:53,404
I just pointed to the
blue and white's card,

1176
01:23:54,238 --> 01:23:56,532
the bartender was so hassled

1177
01:23:56,615 --> 01:23:58,409
he didn't notice whose card
had I pointed to.

1178
01:23:58,534 --> 01:24:01,579
He presumed it was mine. Simple.

1179
01:24:03,372 --> 01:24:04,957
Very classy thief!

1180
01:24:05,499 --> 01:24:07,376
Classy! Thank you.

1181
01:24:08,502 --> 01:24:09,754
Thief?

1182
01:24:10,838 --> 01:24:12,965
He misbehaved with you,
I punished him.

1183
01:24:13,090 --> 01:24:14,175
That's no theft.

1184
01:24:14,592 --> 01:24:15,676
That is theft.

1185
01:24:15,885 --> 01:24:17,887
Feeling guilty? Then apologise to him.

1186
01:24:18,345 --> 01:24:21,849
But if you want to
thank me for punishing him,

1187
01:24:21,932 --> 01:24:23,893
then there's a better bar in Colva.

1188
01:24:26,228 --> 01:24:31,525
Now I get it. I've known
guys to pay the bill and flirt,

1189
01:24:33,110 --> 01:24:34,653
but, dude, without paying!

1190
01:24:35,154 --> 01:24:36,280
Excellent.

1191
01:24:36,697 --> 01:24:39,074
But I am not in Goa to party

1192
01:24:39,450 --> 01:24:42,036
or see cheap tricks
from hunks like you.

1193
01:24:42,578 --> 01:24:43,996
Try it on someone else.

1194
01:24:47,458 --> 01:24:48,584
-Excuse me?
-Yes?

1195
01:24:48,667 --> 01:24:50,002
Sorry, but there's been some confusion,

1196
01:24:50,085 --> 01:24:53,756
can you pay the guy
whose card was used,

1197
01:24:53,964 --> 01:24:55,549
I think they're over there...

1198
01:24:59,804 --> 01:25:02,014
Is he is a ghost
that he just vanished?

1199
01:25:02,264 --> 01:25:04,642
If she shows so much attitude,
he will vanish.

1200
01:25:04,725 --> 01:25:06,894
It was a perfect plan Ishika,
you ruined it.

1201
01:25:07,937 --> 01:25:10,856
He was convinced that you
are a damsel in distress.

1202
01:25:10,940 --> 01:25:12,983
Damsel in distress!

1203
01:25:13,275 --> 01:25:15,820
No one gives a second
glance to damsels these days.

1204
01:25:17,321 --> 01:25:18,531
I can't play a damsel.

1205
01:25:18,697 --> 01:25:22,409
We've hired you! You have to
play according to our rules.

1206
01:25:23,494 --> 01:25:27,122
Miss director, I am the one who
has to deal with him face to face.

1207
01:25:27,498 --> 01:25:29,792
You can't press a remote and have fun.

1208
01:25:31,335 --> 01:25:34,463
I am not an actress,
I have to play it my way.

1209
01:25:35,339 --> 01:25:37,466
What if he were to catch me acting, then?

1210
01:25:42,346 --> 01:25:45,224
The partnership idea has to
be sold to him, I'll sell it.

1211
01:25:46,058 --> 01:25:49,854
I've never let you go empty
handed from the mall, have I?

1212
01:25:51,939 --> 01:25:55,442
Okay, but now we have to
think of a new move.

1213
01:25:56,110 --> 01:25:59,280
Don't worry the next
move will be made by him.

1214
01:26:01,574 --> 01:26:04,159
With hearty compliments
from Mr. Vikram Thapar.

1215
01:26:05,202 --> 01:26:08,914
-Vikram who?
-Mr. Thapar, Goa's beach king.

1216
01:26:09,206 --> 01:26:12,167
Out of all the water sporting
between Varca to Anjuna

1217
01:26:12,251 --> 01:26:14,003
at least a dozen are owned by him.

1218
01:26:14,086 --> 01:26:18,716
Including the one at our hotel.

1219
01:26:19,925 --> 01:26:22,011
You met him last night at the bar.

1220
01:26:23,512 --> 01:26:26,807
That's Vikram Thapar?

1221
01:26:27,308 --> 01:26:28,475
Yes, ma'am.

1222
01:26:29,101 --> 01:26:31,478
-Interesting name.
-Interesting man.

1223
01:26:32,396 --> 01:26:37,776
If you want to thank him, then
you can find him at the beach.

1224
01:26:38,152 --> 01:26:39,820
-Have a nice day, ma'am.
-Thank you.

1225
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:46,285
This is finished.

1226
01:26:46,702 --> 01:26:49,079
How will we run the
business if he does this?

1227
01:26:49,705 --> 01:26:50,789
Tell him.

1228
01:27:03,135 --> 01:27:04,470
Grease.

1229
01:27:07,890 --> 01:27:12,102
Mr. Beach King, credit card trick
didn't work so you sent flowers?

1230
01:27:13,354 --> 01:27:15,689
They always work. Here you are.

1231
01:27:16,607 --> 01:27:17,691
So I was right.

1232
01:27:18,108 --> 01:27:20,527
Last night's drama was to attract me.

1233
01:27:20,903 --> 01:27:22,821
You are so attractive what could I do?

1234
01:27:24,615 --> 01:27:25,741
Thank you.

1235
01:27:26,367 --> 01:27:27,493
For the flowers.

1236
01:27:28,869 --> 01:27:31,121
Is it from your own
money or stolen cash?

1237
01:27:32,873 --> 01:27:33,958
Did they smell nice?

1238
01:27:34,541 --> 01:27:36,210
So how does it matter then?

1239
01:27:40,005 --> 01:27:41,173
I want to go for a ride.

1240
01:27:41,256 --> 01:27:43,467
-Come, I will take you
-I will drive.

1241
01:27:58,857 --> 01:28:01,694
If you are not here to party
then what're you doing here?

1242
01:28:02,486 --> 01:28:04,780
To prove that I can
also set up a business.

1243
01:28:05,489 --> 01:28:07,741
-Prove to whom?
-To my father.

1244
01:28:08,993 --> 01:28:12,121
I told him I wanted to set up a
chain of restaurants in India,

1245
01:28:12,204 --> 01:28:13,580
he thought it was stupid.

1246
01:28:13,914 --> 01:28:16,458
Do anything in the U.S. but not in India.

1247
01:28:16,959 --> 01:28:19,420
After numerous fights
he has conceded that

1248
01:28:19,545 --> 01:28:24,883
I first set up the project
like land, licences, clearances,

1249
01:28:24,967 --> 01:28:28,554
staff everything, and then
he'll invest five million.

1250
01:28:29,805 --> 01:28:32,558
-Five million dollars is...
-Twenty five crores

1251
01:28:33,434 --> 01:28:34,768
Right.

1252
01:28:35,811 --> 01:28:38,355
But do you know how much
he's given me for my trip?

1253
01:28:38,814 --> 01:28:43,444
Five lakhs including transport,
hotel food.

1254
01:28:44,278 --> 01:28:45,404
But I'll prove it.

1255
01:28:45,487 --> 01:28:47,489
I won't leave here till
my restaurant is set up,

1256
01:28:47,573 --> 01:28:50,367
even if it means
sleeping on the beaches.

1257
01:28:55,330 --> 01:28:57,291
I can help you set up your restaurant.

1258
01:28:57,666 --> 01:28:58,917
Really?

1259
01:28:59,835 --> 01:29:01,003
But why?

1260
01:29:04,923 --> 01:29:08,135
Lone girl, millionaire dad,

1261
01:29:08,302 --> 01:29:10,929
trap her, take her money.

1262
01:29:11,597 --> 01:29:12,723
Is this the plan?

1263
01:29:14,767 --> 01:29:17,144
Right! This was my plan.

1264
01:29:17,686 --> 01:29:18,771
But you're so clever,

1265
01:29:19,563 --> 01:29:21,106
you don't need any help.

1266
01:29:21,940 --> 01:29:23,317
Goa is waiting for you.

1267
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:27,029
All the honest officers, land owners,
cops, collector, ministers.

1268
01:29:28,030 --> 01:29:31,075
They will help you honestly.

1269
01:29:32,242 --> 01:29:33,619
You have a good evening.

1270
01:29:37,539 --> 01:29:39,124
Hey, Mr. Beach King!

1271
01:29:40,793 --> 01:29:41,960
Want to have a beer?

1272
01:29:51,428 --> 01:29:53,222
I don't want any favors.

1273
01:29:54,515 --> 01:29:56,767
Do you want an equal
partnership of sharing,

1274
01:29:57,226 --> 01:29:59,436
but profit sharing will be 60-40.

1275
01:30:00,687 --> 01:30:02,314
You said equal partnership?

1276
01:30:02,773 --> 01:30:05,275
My idea, so 60 mine. Agreed?

1277
01:30:05,692 --> 01:30:07,069
Okay agreed.

1278
01:30:08,153 --> 01:30:10,739
You will also have to
invest in the partnership.

1279
01:30:12,407 --> 01:30:13,492
Oh.

1280
01:30:15,160 --> 01:30:16,245
Obviously.

1281
01:30:16,620 --> 01:30:19,039
Why do you think I am
letting you be my partner?

1282
01:30:20,749 --> 01:30:23,836
I'm not going to runV away
with your money,

1283
01:30:24,044 --> 01:30:27,047
all the expenses will be
transparent and for the yacht party.

1284
01:30:27,506 --> 01:30:28,632
Yacht party?

1285
01:30:30,134 --> 01:30:31,218
See?

1286
01:30:31,885 --> 01:30:33,595
Every time I go to meet somebody,

1287
01:30:33,846 --> 01:30:35,389
they don't take me seriously.

1288
01:30:36,348 --> 01:30:39,726
If we organise a yacht party,

1289
01:30:40,435 --> 01:30:43,230
good food, music, wine,

1290
01:30:43,647 --> 01:30:47,359
invite all the important people
in Goa, put photos in the press.

1291
01:30:47,734 --> 01:30:50,028
Just see, the phone
won't stop ringing.

1292
01:30:50,154 --> 01:30:52,739
Entire Goa will help our restaurant.

1293
01:30:54,116 --> 01:30:55,951
That's how we promote in the states.

1294
01:30:58,912 --> 01:31:01,665
Had I the money,
I would've had the party,

1295
01:31:02,332 --> 01:31:04,042
and started the restaurant by now.

1296
01:31:05,711 --> 01:31:07,254
How much will we need for the party?

1297
01:31:08,672 --> 01:31:11,425
A crore perhaps.

1298
01:31:15,971 --> 01:31:18,056
As soon as dad
sanctions his 25 crores,

1299
01:31:18,473 --> 01:31:20,142
your money will be returned.

1300
01:31:20,767 --> 01:31:25,147
So partner or no partner?

1301
01:31:33,447 --> 01:31:34,573
Partner.

1302
01:32:07,856 --> 01:32:08,982
How much for this?

1303
01:32:09,107 --> 01:32:10,317
One can get shoes for 500 rupees here.

1304
01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:11,735
And that one?

1305
01:32:17,366 --> 01:32:19,451
Need to check other properties, let's go.

1306
01:32:33,632 --> 01:32:34,800
Which brand?

1307
01:32:34,967 --> 01:32:37,010
Mango, Diesel, Dolce &amp; Gabbana, Gucci.

1308
01:32:42,975 --> 01:32:44,059
What time is it?

1309
01:32:44,142 --> 01:32:45,519
Tripping on these Jalapenos.

1310
01:32:45,602 --> 01:32:46,770
We have to leave now,
come on, come on, come on...

1311
01:32:46,853 --> 01:32:49,022
-I'm not done eating...
-We have to leave, he is not going to

1312
01:32:49,106 --> 01:32:50,190
Wait for us all day.

1313
01:32:50,274 --> 01:32:51,233
What's the rush?

1314
01:32:51,316 --> 01:32:52,317
We're late for the meeting.

1315
01:32:53,527 --> 01:32:56,113
-What happened?
-You have got to be kidding me, man...

1316
01:32:59,992 --> 01:33:02,077
What're you doing?

1317
01:33:02,202 --> 01:33:04,288
Watch out, watch out. What the hell?

1318
01:33:34,985 --> 01:33:36,111
No price tag?

1319
01:33:36,320 --> 01:33:37,904
We'll put it when we get there.

1320
01:33:38,572 --> 01:33:40,282
Yeah, Gaurav? On our way.

1321
01:33:48,790 --> 01:33:51,043
-Hey, Gaurav. What's up?
-You are looking nice.

1322
01:33:51,126 --> 01:33:52,294
Come, come, come.

1323
01:33:52,377 --> 01:33:53,879
-Okay, that's Saira.
-Hello.

1324
01:33:53,962 --> 01:33:54,796
This is Dimple.

1325
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:55,714
-Hi.
-Hello.

1326
01:33:55,797 --> 01:33:57,549
Ladies on a mission huh? Come.

1327
01:34:17,194 --> 01:34:19,154
Like a fool I rushed here,

1328
01:34:19,863 --> 01:34:21,323
didn't even pack properly.

1329
01:34:21,656 --> 01:34:23,700
All the money is
going to the hotel bill.

1330
01:34:25,952 --> 01:34:29,289
I think I should shift from Pallazzo
to a cheaper one star hotel.

1331
01:34:30,123 --> 01:34:33,668
From the money I save,
I can buy a dress at least.

1332
01:34:33,752 --> 01:34:35,796
You won't be able to handle a one star.

1333
01:34:36,338 --> 01:34:37,631
So what to do?

1334
01:34:38,256 --> 01:34:40,092
I don't have a dress for the party.

1335
01:34:43,011 --> 01:34:44,262
Let's go shopping!

1336
01:34:45,722 --> 01:34:46,848
How sweet.

1337
01:34:52,729 --> 01:34:55,690
This is what they are
wearing in New York now, like now.

1338
01:34:56,483 --> 01:34:58,151
-It's lovely.
-Prada!

1339
01:34:58,402 --> 01:34:59,653
Beautiful.

1340
01:35:00,195 --> 01:35:01,363
Ninety thousand only.

1341
01:35:01,571 --> 01:35:02,697
Only!

1342
01:35:04,991 --> 01:35:06,827
One dress is not good enough,

1343
01:35:06,952 --> 01:35:08,954
I mean at least...

1344
01:35:10,872 --> 01:35:12,374
I need at least eight,

1345
01:35:12,958 --> 01:35:16,837
matching foot wear,
jewellery, accessories.

1346
01:35:16,920 --> 01:35:18,171
Take everything.

1347
01:35:19,047 --> 01:35:20,882
It's an investment for our future.

1348
01:35:20,966 --> 01:35:23,135
I mean business future.

1349
01:35:30,517 --> 01:35:31,810
And it's backless.

1350
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:34,604
It's good.

1351
01:35:38,817 --> 01:35:39,901
Now, that's nice.

1352
01:35:41,862 --> 01:35:42,988
It's nice.

1353
01:35:57,878 --> 01:35:58,962
Nice couple.

1354
01:35:59,921 --> 01:36:01,423
But the boy is short.

1355
01:36:02,174 --> 01:36:03,592
Why don't you get heels?

1356
01:36:06,219 --> 01:36:08,263
I can't believe we
have shopped so much.

1357
01:36:22,944 --> 01:36:25,322
Sixteen lakhs fifty thousand.

1358
01:36:25,405 --> 01:36:27,324
Yes! Yes! Yes!

1359
01:36:28,658 --> 01:36:29,784
Mind blowing.

1360
01:36:30,410 --> 01:36:31,578
Thank you.

1361
01:36:33,413 --> 01:36:34,581
Oh, my God.

1362
01:36:36,541 --> 01:36:38,668
Okay, enough hugging, kissing.

1363
01:36:38,752 --> 01:36:40,045
Let's get back to work.

1364
01:36:40,545 --> 01:36:41,588
Phase two!

1365
01:36:43,632 --> 01:36:44,674
Can you talk, Ishika?

1366
01:36:45,592 --> 01:36:48,637
Listen yachts are
parked at the Madovi Jetty.

1367
01:36:49,012 --> 01:36:51,014
One of them is my
friend Fardeen's Yacht.

1368
01:36:51,640 --> 01:36:53,558
He has explained
everything to the captain.

1369
01:36:53,642 --> 01:36:54,893
He is all set.

1370
01:36:54,976 --> 01:36:57,479
He will ask you for the
entire payment in advance.

1371
01:36:57,729 --> 01:36:59,481
Then you take over.

1372
01:37:00,148 --> 01:37:02,526
The yacht is Brown 
 in colour and called...

1373
01:37:03,109 --> 01:37:05,779
Freedom. Freedom it is!

1374
01:37:06,530 --> 01:37:07,614
So?

1375
01:37:07,697 --> 01:37:09,199
Including food and beverages,

1376
01:37:09,282 --> 01:37:11,535
and 6:00 p.m. to midnight
will be 20 lakhs in total.

1377
01:37:13,828 --> 01:37:14,871
Too much no?

1378
01:37:15,038 --> 01:37:16,540
That's 40,000 dollars.

1379
01:37:17,082 --> 01:37:20,710
In the US this party will
cost at least a 100,000 dollars.

1380
01:37:20,961 --> 01:37:22,712
Actually, it's a good deal.

1381
01:37:23,713 --> 01:37:25,757
Aye, aye, captain sail the boat.

1382
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:28,843
Full advance payment in cash,
then booking, then sailing.

1383
01:37:35,141 --> 01:37:36,184
Done.

1384
01:37:45,986 --> 01:37:47,070
How much is this?

1385
01:38:07,841 --> 01:38:08,925
Invitation card?

1386
01:38:12,137 --> 01:38:13,722
Invitation card.

1387
01:38:14,931 --> 01:38:17,434
Oh. Gorgeous.

1388
01:38:18,893 --> 01:38:20,145
Here you go.

1389
01:38:33,491 --> 01:38:34,534
Ninety rupees.

1390
01:38:35,994 --> 01:38:37,078
Is this the cheapest?

1391
01:38:37,162 --> 01:38:39,539
Only mango juice will
be cheaper than this.

1392
01:38:39,623 --> 01:38:40,874
Forty bottles, please.

1393
01:38:42,876 --> 01:38:43,960
How much?

1394
01:38:44,044 --> 01:38:45,086
Twenty and 50

1395
01:38:45,587 --> 01:38:46,963
I'll take all.

1396
01:38:56,514 --> 01:39:00,018
A 200 bucks bottle
is now worth 90,000.

1397
01:39:22,082 --> 01:39:23,124
Thank you.

1398
01:40:05,375 --> 01:40:08,086
So far we've earned 45 lakhs.

1399
01:40:08,420 --> 01:40:13,258
After Ishika's fee and all expenses,
we are left with 35.

1400
01:40:39,743 --> 01:40:42,787
Ishika Patel, you are a genius.

1401
01:40:43,872 --> 01:40:45,665
There are at least eight investors.

1402
01:40:45,749 --> 01:40:48,334
In fact, we might not need
your dad's money anymore.

1403
01:40:48,626 --> 01:40:51,087
No. I don't need anymore partners.

1404
01:40:51,629 --> 01:40:54,716
I am happy with one,
whom I can trust completely.

1405
01:40:56,551 --> 01:41:00,305
No really, for any
business trust is crucial.

1406
01:41:02,682 --> 01:41:03,767
Right.

1407
01:41:05,059 --> 01:41:06,394
Trust is crucial.

1408
01:41:11,608 --> 01:41:12,776
Oh, my God! Vikram.

1409
01:41:21,993 --> 01:41:23,870
Once more, once more.

1410
01:41:28,958 --> 01:41:30,960
We never had any in our childhood

1411
01:41:31,044 --> 01:41:32,962
so I go crazy when I see them now.

1412
01:41:33,213 --> 01:41:35,632
Papa got us one of each firework and,

1413
01:41:35,715 --> 01:41:37,509
they would be finished in seconds.

1414
01:41:37,801 --> 01:41:39,677
I would be angry with the
fireworks when they finished so soon,

1415
01:41:39,803 --> 01:41:41,638
wondering, why have they finished?

1416
01:41:41,721 --> 01:41:43,389
But why rationing on the fireworks?

1417
01:41:43,473 --> 01:41:46,643
Your father could've
bought an entire factory right?

1418
01:41:51,481 --> 01:41:55,068
Had my father not rationed
in the beginning of his business,

1419
01:41:55,193 --> 01:41:57,445
then how would he have become
the Motel King?

1420
01:41:59,906 --> 01:42:01,449
Let's go.

1421
01:42:02,075 --> 01:42:03,159
Let's go party.

1422
01:42:05,078 --> 01:42:06,871
Haven't we just been to a party?

1423
01:42:07,455 --> 01:42:09,332
That wasn't a party, it was business.

1424
01:42:09,999 --> 01:42:11,251
Isn't it late?

1425
01:42:11,751 --> 01:42:13,211
Is someone waiting for you?

1426
01:42:17,882 --> 01:42:20,260
Alright, Vikram Thapar, let's party.

1427
01:42:20,718 --> 01:42:21,761
Let's party.

1428
01:42:32,730 --> 01:42:33,982
She isn't answering.

1429
01:42:35,525 --> 01:42:37,235
Booking was till 12.

1430
01:42:37,694 --> 01:42:39,654
Party must have
finished long time ago.

1431
01:42:40,530 --> 01:42:43,491
Real romance has happened
between the calf and the butcher.

1432
01:42:44,409 --> 01:42:45,660
Real romance.

1433
01:42:46,452 --> 01:42:50,707
Raina, if what she is
saying is true, then?

1434
01:42:54,085 --> 01:42:55,128
Then, my dear,

1435
01:42:57,046 --> 01:42:58,506
we are screwed.

1436
01:48:46,020 --> 01:48:47,813
All night party!

1437
01:48:48,397 --> 01:48:50,107
While we've been
rotting in that hell-hole,

1438
01:48:50,191 --> 01:48:51,984
she is living it up in the five-star.

1439
01:48:52,068 --> 01:48:53,694
Partying with Sunny all night.

1440
01:48:54,028 --> 01:48:56,239
I had to go with him
to build his confidence.

1441
01:48:56,364 --> 01:48:59,116
What other debaucheries did
you do to build his confidence?

1442
01:48:59,200 --> 01:49:02,370
-Raina, please tell her to shut up.
-I am not going to shut up.

1443
01:49:02,828 --> 01:49:04,247
You are in Goa for us.

1444
01:49:04,330 --> 01:49:05,414
We've hired you.

1445
01:49:05,498 --> 01:49:06,832
We are footing the bills.

1446
01:49:06,958 --> 01:49:10,253
Not for you to hang out with my
ex-boyfriend like shameless bitch.

1447
01:49:10,336 --> 01:49:11,629
That's enough, Dimple.

1448
01:49:12,546 --> 01:49:14,131
You are always taking her side.

1449
01:49:14,507 --> 01:49:16,175
Dimple, just shut up.

1450
01:49:25,309 --> 01:49:28,145
Do you have any idea
how worried we've been all night?

1451
01:49:28,688 --> 01:49:29,730
Any idea?

1452
01:49:36,529 --> 01:49:37,613
I am really sorry.

1453
01:49:39,865 --> 01:49:41,867
Champagne, beer, yacht,

1454
01:49:43,619 --> 01:49:45,288
brain got a bit side tracked.

1455
01:49:47,373 --> 01:49:49,083
I promise it won't happen again.

1456
01:49:52,003 --> 01:49:53,129
I am on your side.

1457
01:49:54,547 --> 01:49:57,550
Now the focus is to
defeat the Bloody Scoundrel.

1458
01:49:57,633 --> 01:49:59,302
Down with the Bloody Scoundrel.

1459
01:49:59,427 --> 01:50:01,679
We haven't even
recovered half the amount yet.

1460
01:50:02,471 --> 01:50:03,806
We've a long way to go.

1461
01:50:04,724 --> 01:50:05,975
Don't ditch, Ishika.

1462
01:50:07,560 --> 01:50:08,644
I won't.

1463
01:50:12,231 --> 01:50:13,607
Dimple, come on.

1464
01:51:10,498 --> 01:51:12,124
Hi, you haven't slept?

1465
01:51:12,375 --> 01:51:14,460
I want to show you
something mind blowing.

1466
01:51:14,794 --> 01:51:15,878
Okay, let's go.

1467
01:51:21,550 --> 01:51:23,928
I know, even my mind
is completely blown.

1468
01:51:25,388 --> 01:51:26,555
Wow!

1469
01:51:27,890 --> 01:51:29,934
This land is perfect for the restaurant.

1470
01:51:32,978 --> 01:51:34,188
Very nice.

1471
01:51:36,399 --> 01:51:37,691
Actually it's perfect.

1472
01:51:40,486 --> 01:51:41,779
Let's make it here.

1473
01:51:42,238 --> 01:51:43,656
Let's talk to the owner.

1474
01:51:43,739 --> 01:51:45,032
Wait, wait, wait partner.

1475
01:51:47,410 --> 01:51:49,954
Before we go ahead I
want to share a few secrets,

1476
01:51:50,663 --> 01:51:53,791
after knowing them you might
want to break the partnership.

1477
01:51:56,377 --> 01:51:57,711
What secret can that be?

1478
01:51:59,463 --> 01:52:01,173
I'm not breaking the partnership.

1479
01:52:02,299 --> 01:52:04,718
You will also have to
tell me your secrets.

1480
01:52:11,892 --> 01:52:13,352
I don't have any secrets.

1481
01:52:13,978 --> 01:52:15,980
-You can tell me yours.
-I am a conman.

1482
01:52:21,360 --> 01:52:22,445
I am a thief.

1483
01:52:26,157 --> 01:52:29,577
For the last 15 years,
I've conned 30 ladies.

1484
01:52:30,202 --> 01:52:31,620
You are the 31st.

1485
01:52:35,207 --> 01:52:36,709
Friendship, partnership...

1486
01:52:36,792 --> 01:52:39,753
Investment in your
project has all been for this.

1487
01:52:41,755 --> 01:52:43,883
My plan was to run
away after fleecing you,

1488
01:52:49,388 --> 01:52:51,223
but I fell in love with you Ishika.

1489
01:52:55,019 --> 01:52:56,061
I am not lying.

1490
01:52:59,064 --> 01:53:00,107
I have lied a lot.

1491
01:53:04,820 --> 01:53:06,489
I've spent my entire life alone,

1492
01:53:08,866 --> 01:53:11,160
even if I wanted to be
friends with someone,

1493
01:53:11,285 --> 01:53:13,078
I would scold myself and restrain,

1494
01:53:13,162 --> 01:53:15,456
but since I met
my heart won't listen to me.

1495
01:53:22,421 --> 01:53:23,506
Do you?

1496
01:53:27,051 --> 01:53:28,135
Love me?

1497
01:53:32,431 --> 01:53:33,766
Will you marry me, Ishika?

1498
01:53:37,269 --> 01:53:38,395
He proposed to you?

1499
01:53:40,022 --> 01:53:42,024
Liar. Look at her face.

1500
01:53:42,107 --> 01:53:44,818
He never proposed to me,
why would he propose to her?

1501
01:53:45,110 --> 01:53:46,529
It's not a proposal,

1502
01:53:48,113 --> 01:53:49,156
it's a con silly.

1503
01:53:49,573 --> 01:53:51,784
The biggest con of his life.

1504
01:53:52,535 --> 01:53:54,995
After marrying her he
will have her, her father's,

1505
01:53:55,079 --> 01:53:58,249
the land's, the
restaurant's money in his pocket.

1506
01:53:58,415 --> 01:54:00,000
With an investment of 40 lakhs,

1507
01:54:00,084 --> 01:54:02,628
he plans to hit
the billion dollar jackpot.

1508
01:54:05,256 --> 01:54:06,590
That's why I was wondering

1509
01:54:06,799 --> 01:54:10,844
why is he buying her all
these dresses and shoes for?

1510
01:54:11,845 --> 01:54:13,430
He will marry for money.

1511
01:54:18,269 --> 01:54:19,353
Marry him.

1512
01:54:20,187 --> 01:54:21,522
No way. Are you crazy?

1513
01:54:21,605 --> 01:54:24,066
This is the best way to
get the rest of our money.

1514
01:54:25,109 --> 01:54:26,193
How?

1515
01:54:26,318 --> 01:54:27,820
Her father won't marry her off

1516
01:54:27,903 --> 01:54:33,659
to a thief like Vikram Thapar
without any security right?

1517
01:54:34,493 --> 01:54:38,581
And for that security Ishika's
father will ask him to buy that land

1518
01:54:38,789 --> 01:54:39,832
in her name.

1519
01:54:40,165 --> 01:54:41,417
Before the wedding.

1520
01:54:41,500 --> 01:54:43,377
So will she get married to Sunny?

1521
01:54:44,169 --> 01:54:46,505
No, the plot will be
bought before the wedding.

1522
01:54:46,589 --> 01:54:49,216
We'll sell it
immediately after its registration.

1523
01:54:49,717 --> 01:54:53,470
Take our money,
and get on the first flight home.

1524
01:54:54,054 --> 01:54:55,431
Not bad, Saira.

1525
01:54:55,514 --> 01:54:57,224
Can you clear one matter first,

1526
01:54:57,308 --> 01:54:59,393
will she or wont she
be married to Sunny?

1527
01:54:59,518 --> 01:55:00,603
No.

1528
01:55:02,146 --> 01:55:04,398
Ishika will only accept his proposal.

1529
01:55:05,733 --> 01:55:07,234
Make him speak to her father.

1530
01:55:10,321 --> 01:55:12,906
Right, we have to find a papa for her.

1531
01:55:14,533 --> 01:55:16,327
Let me figure this out.

1532
01:55:19,413 --> 01:55:20,581
I'll make tea.

1533
01:55:20,706 --> 01:55:21,874
I'll leave.

1534
01:55:21,957 --> 01:55:24,084
No, let Raina finish her call.

1535
01:55:27,296 --> 01:55:28,547
Did he give you flowers?

1536
01:55:31,175 --> 01:55:32,217
What?

1537
01:55:32,301 --> 01:55:35,095
When he proposed. Ring?

1538
01:55:37,056 --> 01:55:38,098
No.

1539
01:55:38,557 --> 01:55:39,642
Plain?

1540
01:55:42,353 --> 01:55:43,395
Kiss?

1541
01:55:45,105 --> 01:55:47,066
You guys must have definitely kissed.

1542
01:55:48,192 --> 01:55:50,903
I am conning him,
and he is conning me.

1543
01:55:52,821 --> 01:55:53,989
Where did the kiss come from?

1544
01:55:54,406 --> 01:55:57,284
Kiss is a bitch.
It creeps up anywhere.

1545
01:55:57,660 --> 01:56:00,079
Okay, papa sorted.

1546
01:56:00,663 --> 01:56:05,376
Ishika tell him I do, I do, I do.

1547
01:56:05,709 --> 01:56:08,170
Before that, let's find
out the value of the land.

1548
01:56:09,672 --> 01:56:11,256
It's a fair deal, ma'am.

1549
01:56:11,382 --> 01:56:12,424
Don't worry.

1550
01:56:12,508 --> 01:56:14,009
Owner is settled in Dubai,

1551
01:56:14,176 --> 01:56:16,053
I have the Power of Attorney.

1552
01:56:16,136 --> 01:56:17,721
I'll do the formalities.

1553
01:56:18,389 --> 01:56:21,558
Final price 90 Lakhs.

1554
01:56:21,642 --> 01:56:24,061
No bargaining. Sorry.

1555
01:56:27,106 --> 01:56:28,190
Ninety Lakhs.

1556
01:56:29,566 --> 01:56:30,984
-My gosh!
-Yes, yes.

1557
01:56:31,527 --> 01:56:32,611
Really?

1558
01:56:32,903 --> 01:56:33,987
Mind-blowing!

1559
01:56:35,197 --> 01:56:36,240
Papa call time!

1560
01:56:42,996 --> 01:56:44,039
Papa.

1561
01:56:50,462 --> 01:56:51,505
Hello Mr. Patel.

1562
01:56:51,630 --> 01:56:52,715
Vikram Thapar?

1563
01:56:52,798 --> 01:56:54,007
Yes sir, Vikram Thapar.

1564
01:56:54,091 --> 01:56:55,759
Let's come straight to the point.

1565
01:56:55,968 --> 01:56:58,971
What's the turnover of 
 your water sports business?

1566
01:56:59,430 --> 01:57:01,098
Not even 50 Lakhs annually.

1567
01:57:01,348 --> 01:57:04,101
Ishika's shoes almost cost that much!

1568
01:57:04,184 --> 01:57:07,771
Sir, honestly I don't
have your kind of money.

1569
01:57:09,815 --> 01:57:13,110
But Ishika's happiness
is most important to me.

1570
01:57:15,320 --> 01:57:17,531
I promise to always keep her happy.

1571
01:57:19,533 --> 01:57:22,119
My dear, a promise has no value.

1572
01:57:22,286 --> 01:57:24,288
My dear a promise has no value.

1573
01:57:24,913 --> 01:57:26,623
Bills cannot be paid by promises.

1574
01:57:27,166 --> 01:57:30,753
Moreover, how do I know you are not
marrying my daughter for her money?

1575
01:57:31,211 --> 01:57:32,296
Tell me.

1576
01:57:35,674 --> 01:57:38,302
Sir, I love Ishika, not her money.

1577
01:57:38,969 --> 01:57:41,013
I can't just believe what you say.

1578
01:57:41,346 --> 01:57:42,931
Trust needs proof.

1579
01:57:43,348 --> 01:57:45,100
If you want to marry Ishika,

1580
01:57:45,184 --> 01:57:49,480
then buy a land of her
choice registered in her name

1581
01:57:49,563 --> 01:57:51,064
for her restaurant.

1582
01:57:51,940 --> 01:57:54,359
I'll make the rest of the 
 investment in the restaurant,

1583
01:57:54,443 --> 01:57:55,903
but if you buy the land

1584
01:57:55,986 --> 01:57:57,112
then I'll be rest assured 
 that she has some security.

1585
01:57:57,529 --> 01:57:58,947
That's my condition.

1586
01:58:10,292 --> 01:58:13,170
What happened? 
 Can't give the security?

1587
01:58:18,217 --> 01:58:21,678
I'll give sir. Of course I will.

1588
01:58:24,097 --> 01:58:25,724
For Ishika, I'll do anything.

1589
01:58:32,689 --> 01:58:34,316
The butcher becomes the calf.

1590
01:58:35,442 --> 01:58:38,237
I am telling you,
the scoundrel is in love.

1591
01:58:38,445 --> 01:58:39,988
He can't love anyone.

1592
01:58:40,489 --> 01:58:42,574
He is laying his trap
slowly and steadily.

1593
01:58:43,075 --> 01:58:45,077
He is getting caught up in it.

1594
01:58:52,376 --> 01:58:53,418
I am trapped.

1595
01:58:56,088 --> 01:58:58,966
I've made a promise
but I don't have 90 lakhs.

1596
01:59:00,634 --> 01:59:03,303
I have only 45 left after the yacht party.

1597
01:59:05,138 --> 01:59:06,223
So now?

1598
01:59:09,351 --> 01:59:12,521
Had I not met you, I could
have conned someone for it easily.

1599
01:59:13,021 --> 01:59:14,189
But now I can't do it.

1600
01:59:16,149 --> 01:59:17,067
I love you...

1601
01:59:19,361 --> 01:59:22,155
But how will I give your
father security? I don't know!

1602
01:59:26,118 --> 01:59:28,370
We will have to give
the rest of the 45 Lakhs.

1603
01:59:28,912 --> 01:59:31,206
Crazy? We've got it
with so much difficulty.

1604
01:59:31,582 --> 01:59:35,460
With our 45 and his 45,
he will buy the plot.

1605
01:59:35,961 --> 01:59:38,630
Hopefully when we sell it
we will get more than 90,

1606
01:59:38,755 --> 01:59:40,674
and we'll recover all our money.

1607
01:59:44,303 --> 01:59:49,266
Okay Ishika, tell him you raised 45
by selling your jewellery.

1608
01:59:49,850 --> 01:59:50,934
Okay?

1609
01:59:53,478 --> 01:59:54,521
But Raina,

1610
01:59:56,523 --> 01:59:59,192
what if he has genuinely
fallen in love with me, then?

1611
02:00:02,404 --> 02:00:03,488
What's going on here?

1612
02:00:03,572 --> 02:00:05,157
Love what else?

1613
02:00:05,490 --> 02:00:07,367
I told you she's a traitor.

1614
02:00:07,451 --> 02:00:10,412
He is leading you on.
He can't love anyone.

1615
02:00:10,495 --> 02:00:11,705
He loves me... perhaps.

1616
02:00:12,539 --> 02:00:15,167
Ishika waved the magic wand

1617
02:00:15,250 --> 02:00:18,045
and the scoundrel became
a caring, honest lover.

1618
02:00:18,128 --> 02:00:20,380
Believe me, he has changed.

1619
02:00:20,631 --> 02:00:23,467
If you look into his eyes,
you will see an honest man.

1620
02:00:23,592 --> 02:00:25,010
Enough, Ishika.

1621
02:00:25,093 --> 02:00:26,428
Even I've seen his eyes,

1622
02:00:26,845 --> 02:00:28,180
when he spoke to my
father-in-law about his poor mother

1623
02:00:28,263 --> 02:00:30,557
and sister and stole our 10 Lakhs.

1624
02:00:30,849 --> 02:00:33,185
If you don't want to
carry on, it's okay.

1625
02:00:33,644 --> 02:00:37,230
But don't mock us.
We're stupid and you're clever.

1626
02:00:38,273 --> 02:00:40,484
When he vanishes
after breaking your heart,

1627
02:00:40,609 --> 02:00:41,944
that's when you will realise her pain

1628
02:00:42,319 --> 02:00:45,739
and know that we are
your well-wishers, not that rogue.

1629
02:00:59,711 --> 02:01:00,754
Raina...

1630
02:01:01,171 --> 02:01:02,214
The money for Vikram.

1631
02:01:02,297 --> 02:01:04,508
Are we crazy to hand over so
much money to a thief's girlfriend?

1632
02:01:04,633 --> 02:01:07,886
You will run away with it.
Aren't you in love with him?

1633
02:01:07,970 --> 02:01:09,221
I am.

1634
02:01:11,473 --> 02:01:12,766
I am in love with him.

1635
02:01:17,062 --> 02:01:19,690
But I'm an honest sales girl, not a thief.

1636
02:01:20,315 --> 02:01:21,942
Less salary, tough life,

1637
02:01:23,694 --> 02:01:29,074
but I feel proud when my
bosses praise me for my honesty.

1638
02:01:31,159 --> 02:01:35,038
I wouldn't sell that
feeling even for a hundred crore.

1639
02:01:37,916 --> 02:01:39,292
I won't cheat you.

1640
02:01:41,378 --> 02:01:42,421
Trust me.

1641
02:02:16,079 --> 02:02:17,581
I'll return all your money.

1642
02:02:18,498 --> 02:02:22,085
Promise me, no more lies.

1643
02:02:35,599 --> 02:02:36,641
I love you.

1644
02:02:38,852 --> 02:02:39,936
I love you.

1645
02:02:43,398 --> 02:02:44,441
Owner?

1646
02:02:44,524 --> 02:02:45,984
Mr. Abhay Salaskar.

1647
02:02:46,526 --> 02:02:47,861
He is settled in Dubai.

1648
02:02:48,195 --> 02:02:50,238
Power of Attorney is with me D'Silva.

1649
02:02:53,158 --> 02:02:54,242
Buyer?

1650
02:02:55,577 --> 02:02:56,620
Ishika Patel.

1651
02:02:58,413 --> 02:02:59,456
Sign please.

1652
02:03:05,629 --> 02:03:07,047
Ma'am, sign here please.

1653
02:03:44,042 --> 02:03:46,128
Hundred percent genuine!

1654
02:03:55,512 --> 02:03:56,555
Ishika,

1655
02:03:58,390 --> 02:04:00,142
sorry, and thank you.

1656
02:04:00,559 --> 02:04:01,560
It's okay.

1657
02:04:09,985 --> 02:04:12,320
Sorry. Thank you.

1658
02:04:14,406 --> 02:04:15,949
I can't wait to see his face

1659
02:04:16,032 --> 02:04:19,578
when he sees us and
realises that he has been duped.

1660
02:04:19,870 --> 02:04:21,413
But where is the scoundrel?

1661
02:04:40,891 --> 02:04:42,225
-This is fine.
-Hello.

1662
02:04:42,350 --> 02:04:45,187
Hello, excuse me, what are you doing here?

1663
02:04:45,896 --> 02:04:46,938
Flood control.

1664
02:04:47,856 --> 02:04:49,107
Where's the flood?

1665
02:04:49,191 --> 02:04:51,193
It's not here now, but it
will come after the monsoons.

1666
02:04:51,276 --> 02:04:52,569
Who gave you permission?

1667
02:04:52,777 --> 02:04:54,571
We are the new owners of this land.

1668
02:04:54,779 --> 02:04:55,906
Take our permission.

1669
02:04:56,031 --> 02:04:58,783
You? Isn't the owner Abhay Salaskar?

1670
02:04:59,701 --> 02:05:01,745
Was. He is in Dubai now. We bought it.

1671
02:05:01,828 --> 02:05:02,913
For 90 lakhs.

1672
02:05:04,247 --> 02:05:06,374
-90 Lakhs!
-Cheap deal, isn't it?

1673
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:08,835
What would be its market value now?

1674
02:05:10,045 --> 02:05:11,213
Three lakhs.

1675
02:05:11,671 --> 02:05:13,006
With great difficulty.

1676
02:05:14,007 --> 02:05:18,511
This is a swamp. It's under
water for five months. What value?

1677
02:05:20,639 --> 02:05:24,893
Check the deed, may be there
is an extra zero by mistake.

1678
02:05:25,477 --> 02:05:27,604
Even nine Lakhs is too much.

1679
02:05:27,687 --> 02:05:30,690
David, Abhay Salaskar has cheated them.

1680
02:05:30,899 --> 02:05:32,234
Ninety Lakhs.

1681
02:05:43,703 --> 02:05:45,163
What's your cut?

1682
02:05:49,960 --> 02:05:51,002
What?

1683
02:05:51,211 --> 02:05:53,838
How much will that
scoundrel give you out of the 90?

1684
02:05:53,964 --> 02:05:56,132
Is it a 50-50 or a 60-40 partnership?

1685
02:05:56,466 --> 02:06:00,053
Was it his idea because an idea
is worth more, or was it yours?

1686
02:06:00,136 --> 02:06:02,264
-Shut up, Raina.
-You double crossing bitch.

1687
02:06:02,347 --> 02:06:04,724
-Shut up, Raina.
-Liar, thief, bloody scoundrel.

1688
02:06:04,808 --> 02:06:05,850
Raina, shut up!

1689
02:06:05,934 --> 02:06:07,644
-Ishika.
-Shut up all of you.

1690
02:06:13,817 --> 02:06:15,151
I did it for you

1691
02:06:17,404 --> 02:06:18,613
and you are accusing me?

1692
02:06:20,407 --> 02:06:21,491
Calling me a thief?

1693
02:06:24,661 --> 02:06:25,704
To hell with you.

1694
02:06:30,333 --> 02:06:31,376
Raina!

1695
02:06:31,835 --> 02:06:34,421
Had Ishika cheated us,
then why would she come here?

1696
02:06:35,005 --> 02:06:36,840
Don't abuse her for your defeat.

1697
02:06:36,923 --> 02:06:38,925
The scoundrel has cheated her as well.

1698
02:07:04,451 --> 02:07:07,454
First, he bought the land himself,  
 for three lakhs

1699
02:07:07,912 --> 02:07:09,873
as Abhay Salaskar from Dubai.

1700
02:07:10,248 --> 02:07:13,209
Then he gave the Power 
 of Attorney to D'Silva.

1701
02:07:14,377 --> 02:07:16,046
Ishika met D'Silva

1702
02:07:16,463 --> 02:07:18,340
who quoted 90 lakhs.

1703
02:07:19,632 --> 02:07:21,468
Out of which we gave 45 Lakhs.

1704
02:07:23,136 --> 02:07:24,471
After signing the deed

1705
02:07:25,096 --> 02:07:27,807
D'Silva gave the entire 
 money to Bloody Scoundrel.

1706
02:08:15,939 --> 02:08:16,981
Aren't I too good?

1707
02:08:21,528 --> 02:08:24,072
I had boarded the plane
after the security check,

1708
02:08:25,990 --> 02:08:27,283
but could not take off.

1709
02:08:30,453 --> 02:08:32,664
For the first time, it was no fun.

1710
02:08:35,834 --> 02:08:39,421
I conned girls because I
thought it was a game,

1711
02:08:40,672 --> 02:08:41,840
which I would win.

1712
02:08:44,259 --> 02:08:45,802
I never stopped to think,

1713
02:08:45,885 --> 02:08:49,806
that along with cash,
what else the girls lost.

1714
02:08:52,142 --> 02:08:53,268
Now that I know,

1715
02:08:55,270 --> 02:08:56,771
the game is no fun.

1716
02:09:00,984 --> 02:09:02,986
I thought I was superstar Shahrukh Khan,

1717
02:09:05,238 --> 02:09:06,406
but this time,

1718
02:09:08,575 --> 02:09:10,160
even though I won, I have lost.

1719
02:09:24,007 --> 02:09:25,425
Your money.

1720
02:09:27,552 --> 02:09:28,636
It is one crore.

1721
02:09:40,482 --> 02:09:42,942
You have straightened
this Bloody Scoundrel out.

1722
02:09:45,695 --> 02:09:47,113
I can't do con jobs anymore,

1723
02:09:48,823 --> 02:09:50,533
and I know nothing else.

1724
02:09:52,785 --> 02:09:53,828
Thanks to you all,

1725
02:09:55,079 --> 02:09:57,749
I will have to learn honest work.

1726
02:10:00,502 --> 02:10:04,422
I am not good at saying sorry,

1727
02:10:05,548 --> 02:10:06,633
so...

1728
02:10:11,429 --> 02:10:12,514
Hats off, boss!

1729
02:10:13,723 --> 02:10:14,807
Hats off.

1730
02:10:27,529 --> 02:10:30,782
If you ever meet Ishika,
tell her my proposal was real.

1731
02:10:32,951 --> 02:10:34,536
I really fell in love with her.

1732
02:10:37,747 --> 02:10:39,707
But she turned out
to be a real player,

1733
02:10:41,543 --> 02:10:42,877
hats off to her as well.

1734
02:10:53,930 --> 02:10:55,181
Abhay Salaskar!

1735
02:10:57,475 --> 02:10:59,352
How does he come up with these names?

1736
02:11:04,107 --> 02:11:06,609
Sunny and I were dating seriously.

1737
02:11:07,902 --> 02:11:10,822
And I wondered why
isn't he going first base?

1738
02:11:12,073 --> 02:11:13,116
First what?

1739
02:11:13,616 --> 02:11:14,701
Kissing!

1740
02:11:15,368 --> 02:11:17,120
So I thought, I'd take him there.

1741
02:11:17,287 --> 02:11:19,122
I came on to him in the night club,

1742
02:11:19,247 --> 02:11:23,209
but he didn't kiss me.

1743
02:11:25,086 --> 02:11:27,255
He could have taken advantage,
I was ready.

1744
02:11:29,716 --> 02:11:31,551
But he didn't exploit me.

1745
02:11:39,601 --> 02:11:42,604
But he doesn't know
how much Ishika loves him, right?

1746
02:11:44,647 --> 02:11:46,065
No, only we know.

1747
02:11:54,198 --> 02:11:55,908
No, no, don't do that.

1748
02:11:56,117 --> 02:11:57,827
Give this pamphlet to your mother.

Ishika Patel.

1755
02:12:27,899 --> 02:12:28,983
Sorry, sir.

1756
02:12:29,692 --> 02:12:31,944
I think you are
looking for another Ishika,

1757
02:12:32,820 --> 02:12:34,280
I am Ishika Desai,

1758
02:12:34,656 --> 02:12:36,115
a small time sales girl,

1759
02:12:36,324 --> 02:12:37,700
my salary is 25,000 rupees.

1760
02:12:38,451 --> 02:12:40,078
I am sure I am no good to you.

1761
02:12:41,454 --> 02:12:44,791
By the way, we have a 25 percent
discount in all the sections.

1762
02:12:44,874 --> 02:12:46,209
Please do check it out.

1763
02:12:46,334 --> 02:12:48,002
Won't you ask me why I came back?

1764
02:12:55,843 --> 02:12:56,886
Not really,

1765
02:12:58,971 --> 02:13:00,056
I am 22 years old,

1766
02:13:01,307 --> 02:13:03,309
I have a lot to achieve, a lot to earn.

1767
02:13:05,228 --> 02:13:08,022
I went off track once and lost out.

1768
02:13:08,981 --> 02:13:10,566
But now I won't make a mistake,

1769
02:13:11,234 --> 02:13:12,360
I want to mint money.

1770
02:13:12,485 --> 02:13:13,736
Not a good plan!

1771
02:13:14,487 --> 02:13:15,947
I've been there, done that.

1772
02:13:16,906 --> 02:13:18,908
It's no fun making money on your own.

1773
02:13:20,993 --> 02:13:23,246
Let's be partners,

1774
02:13:24,038 --> 02:13:26,958
same deal 60 yours, 40 mine.

1775
02:13:28,126 --> 02:13:30,002
No lies, no cheating.

1776
02:13:30,962 --> 02:13:33,423
Your brains, my courage,

1777
02:13:35,049 --> 02:13:36,551
world's best partnership.

1778
02:13:40,012 --> 02:13:41,931
You've conned 31 girls right?

1779
02:13:43,725 --> 02:13:45,101
I don't want to be 32nd.

1780
02:13:46,686 --> 02:13:49,355
I will constantly be
seeking the truth in your lies.

1781
02:13:49,939 --> 02:13:52,942
I was telling the truth then,
I am telling the truth now.

1782
02:13:54,152 --> 02:13:56,529
You were lying then,
you are lying now.

1783
02:13:59,240 --> 02:14:02,118
You might feign anger but
your eyes are saying, clearly,

1784
02:14:02,201 --> 02:14:03,953
that you are happy to see me here.

1785
02:14:07,290 --> 02:14:09,250
That's why we are made for each other,

1786
02:14:11,043 --> 02:14:13,045
we won't be able to lie to each other,

1787
02:14:13,129 --> 02:14:14,672
because we will be caught.

1788
02:14:16,841 --> 02:14:19,594
A 100 percent true partnership
of two liars.

1789
02:14:21,429 --> 02:14:23,181
If you are so in love with my lies,

1790
02:14:23,306 --> 02:14:25,016
then why did you leave me and go?

1791
02:14:25,224 --> 02:14:26,684
It was my last con,

1792
02:14:27,769 --> 02:14:28,978
how could I have lost?

1793
02:14:35,651 --> 02:14:37,487
Ishika Desai, I love you.

1794
02:14:40,865 --> 02:14:41,949
Marry me.

1795
02:14:42,867 --> 02:14:44,202
Straight to marriage,

1796
02:14:44,869 --> 02:14:46,788
don't you want to test me
as a girlfriend or something?

1797
02:14:47,622 --> 02:14:48,998
I am the number one conman,

1798
02:14:49,540 --> 02:14:51,709
I have checked
everything before attacking.

1799
02:14:54,378 --> 02:14:56,047
Wait wait,

1800
02:14:58,966 --> 02:15:00,468
first tell me your real name.

1801
02:15:01,385 --> 02:15:02,428
Bahl,

1802
02:15:03,304 --> 02:15:04,388
Ricky Bahl.

1803
02:15:07,600 --> 02:15:08,851
Ricky!

1804
02:15:09,811 --> 02:15:11,187
What kind of name is that?

1805
02:15:11,813 --> 02:15:14,065
I don't want to marry a Ricky.

1806
02:15:31,082 --> 02:15:33,584
Dimple, don't worry.

1807
02:15:33,751 --> 02:15:37,255
We'll look for a much better groom
for you than Ricky.

1808
02:15:37,588 --> 02:15:40,466
I don't want him anymore,

1809
02:15:40,883 --> 02:15:42,844
I just want to go home
to mummy and papa.

1810
02:16:14,041 --> 02:16:18,462
The world dances 
 On the cue of boys

1811
02:16:22,174 --> 02:16:26,721
The world dances 
 On the cue of boys

1812
02:16:26,804 --> 02:16:30,391
Just tell the girls  
 About this simple funda

1813
02:16:30,975 --> 02:16:33,311
Won't get conned, but will con them

1814
02:16:33,394 --> 02:16:35,104
Will not lose,  
 But will win them

1815
02:16:35,313 --> 02:16:38,858
They're girls, keep them on your side

1816
02:16:39,066 --> 02:16:41,152
Con the girls

1817
02:16:41,235 --> 02:16:45,114
Con the girls

1818
02:16:45,698 --> 02:16:47,325
Con them

1819
02:16:47,575 --> 02:16:49,452
Con the girls

1820
02:16:49,619 --> 02:16:53,664
Con the girls

1821
02:16:53,956 --> 02:16:56,542
Con them

1822
02:17:13,434 --> 02:17:17,772
They think it's easy to win

1823
02:17:22,109 --> 02:17:26,280
They think it's easy to win

1824
02:17:26,447 --> 02:17:30,701
This time, we will defeat them

1825
02:17:30,785 --> 02:17:34,872
These are tall claims 
 Very light claims

1826
02:17:35,039 --> 02:17:38,417
Their pockets are loaded  
 But hollow are their brains

1827
02:17:38,584 --> 02:17:42,421
Con the boys

1828
02:17:42,505 --> 02:17:45,216
Con the boys

1829
02:17:45,341 --> 02:17:46,842
Con them

1830
02:17:46,926 --> 02:17:51,222
Con the boys

1831
02:17:51,305 --> 02:17:53,224
Con the boys

1832
02:17:53,432 --> 02:17:56,018
Con them

1833
02:18:13,119 --> 02:18:17,248
The more you praise them 
 And pay attention to them

1834
02:18:17,623 --> 02:18:21,919
Their pride is inflated

1835
02:18:25,923 --> 02:18:30,011
They just look for some chance  
 And try to woo us

1836
02:18:30,344 --> 02:18:34,056
If you extend your hand  
 They will show attitude

1837
02:18:34,598 --> 02:18:38,602
Let's get through their tricks 
 And check-mate them

1838
02:18:38,686 --> 02:18:41,731
Enjoy the fun

1839
02:18:42,148 --> 02:18:46,277
Con the boys

1840
02:18:46,610 --> 02:18:48,904
Con the boys

1841
02:18:49,030 --> 02:18:51,073
Con them

1842
02:18:51,198 --> 02:18:54,702
Con the girls

1843
02:18:54,869 --> 02:18:58,497
Con the girls

1844
02:19:07,715 --> 02:19:09,925
Con the girls

1845
02:19:10,051 --> 02:19:11,469
Con the boys

1846
02:19:11,594 --> 02:19:13,345
Con the girls

1847
02:19:14,013 --> 02:19:16,098
Con the boys

1848
02:19:16,348 --> 02:19:18,017
Con the girls 
 Con the boys

1849
02:19:18,517 --> 02:19:20,603
Con the girls 
 Con the boys

1850
02:19:20,686 --> 02:19:21,937
Con them
