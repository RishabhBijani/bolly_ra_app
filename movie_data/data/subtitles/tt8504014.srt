1
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,460
- Papa, let's go! 
- We're going, we're going, son.

2
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,170
- Papa! 
- Yes, yes! We're going.

3
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,400
- Papa, let's go! 
- Son, please. Papa is trying to talk.

4
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,380
Tell me about the car features.

5
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,790
When your kid calms down...

6
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:05,670
...I'll explain everything.

7
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:06,750
Mr. Gill!

8
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:11,130
Papa, let's go.

9
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:17,030
Son, this car is for you. 
Go, play with it.

10
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,040
Mr. Gill.

11
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,710
Varun Batra, CEO.

12
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:22,630
I spotted you from my office.

13
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:27,500
And I'm not surprised your son 
doesn't like this car.

14
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:33,000
Even I think this car is not 
suitable for your family.

15
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:35,710
Go home, Akash.

16
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,040
Allow me to show you 
the right car. Come.

17
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,540
The Volkswagen Tiguan.

18
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,590
A car that oozes perfection 
from every angle.

19
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:49,590
I won't bore you with describing 
all its amazing features.

20
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,590
But yes, the sunroof...

21
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:54,710
...and drive-mode selector 
makes this a sporty SUV.

22
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:57,670
A perfect combination 
for your family's journey.

23
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:02,790
It's not my job to advise customers 
but I took one look at you...

24
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:06,760
...and, honestly, I can't see you 
behind the wheel of any other car.

25
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,630
You can have a look.

26
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:37,000
Papa! Let's go home.

27
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,710
I don't want that car, Papa!

28
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:41,040
- One second, sonny. 
- Papa, I wanna go home!

29
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,600
Sorry. My son's upset. 
I'll come back later.

30
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,390
Sir...

31
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,710
Varun, you go home too.

32
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,170
You need a drink.

33
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:05,460
Come on, guys. Cheers!

34
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:13,920
First time in my career, a one-foot 
nothing ruined a deal.

35
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,670
"Don't want it."

36
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:19,540
How can anyone be scared 
of a wife or a kid?

37
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:28,250
Deepu's on the line. 
Hello, Deepu!

38
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:31,930
"How can anyone be scared 
of a wife or a kid?" The proof!

39
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:35,040
- Yes, Deepu? 
- Where are you, Varun?

40
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:38,500
At the showroom. 
Darling, it's a very, very busy day.

41
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:40,420
What's the date today?

42
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:45,670
- When's our anniversary? 
- October.

43
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,540
And Deepu's birthday?

44
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,380
- She's your wife! 
- How should we know?

45
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,740
Darling, sorry, that was a customer.

46
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:58,420
Today's the 12th of January. Why?

47
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:01,130
What's special about the 12th?

48
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:03,790
The 12th of January?

49
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,500
I'm ovulating, Varun.

50
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:09,210
I stuck a note on your cupboard 
to remind you.

51
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:11,040
It clearly said:

52
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,960
"On 12th January, we're trying 
for a child."

53
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:20,460
Darling, I have so much work. 
So many deliveries.

54
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:23,890
- Get the invoice ready. 
- Yes, sir.

55
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:28,000
Why don't you ask your customers 
to give you a baby?

56
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:30,170
Let them do the delivering.

57
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:31,500
Listen carefully, Varun.

58
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:35,840
If you want this baby to look like you, 
be home in half an hour.

59
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:39,120
What do you mean by that? 
Deepu!

60
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,670
What did she say?

61
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,710
She's ov...overreacting.

62
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:53,790
- Is your helicopter here? 
- Parked right outside!

63
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:56,210
See you later. Bye.

64
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,540
Where are all your clothes?

65
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,000
I gotta poop.

66
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,130
You've been drinking.

67
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,790
And smoking.

68
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,590
My friends insisted, 
so I had one root beer.

69
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:16,630
Liar! You were drinking 
with your pals.

70
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:18,790
You know we're going 
to Delhi tomorrow.

71
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,040
Today's an important day for us.

72
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,670
How can you be so irresponsible?

73
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,760
Must I keep reminding you? 
Drinking and smoking damages sperm.

74
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,290
I had one drag.

75
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:32,340
If one drag can weaken 
my sperm count, then shame on it!

76
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:34,630
This isn't about sperm, 
it's about your promise.

77
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:37,670
Don't I want to go out drinking 
with my friends?

78
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:41,000
But I know what's important. 
Show some maturity.

79
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:42,960
Look who's talking!

80
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:46,380
Remember the doctor's advice? 
"Make sure you get plenty of sleep."

81
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,540
And who was watching 
"Baby's Day Out" till 3am?

82
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:50,880
So mature of you!

83
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:54,510
Richa said seeing images of cute kids 
puts one in a good mood.

84
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:57,040
And a good mood means 
healthy kids.

85
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,880
I can't believe it.

86
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:01,130
You're a leading journalist 
and Richa's a top lawyer.

87
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:02,670
Is this what you two talk about?

88
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:08,130
Great! Keep staring at cute kids. 
Maybe that'll get you pregnant.

89
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:11,000
- Don't you want children? 
- Of course I do.

90
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:14,230
But not if it turns the 
bedroom into a battlefield.

91
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,960
Think of the pressure on me.

92
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:20,090
I don't even win video games. 
How do you expect me to score in bed?

93
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,000
Gone off pooping?

94
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:33,000
It's my poop. Poop or not poop, 
what's it to you?

95
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:40,840
I'm sorry. 
I want a kid so badly.

96
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:43,380
I've been pressuring you too much.

97
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,170
I'm sorry, baby.

98
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:54,590
I'm sorry too.

99
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:06,440
Here we go to battle again, 
Comrades!

100
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:22,500
Planning a moon jump?

101
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:25,460
This boosts my chances of conceiving.

102
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:29,710
Chances of you losing your mind 
are far greater.

103
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,380
I'm still mad at you.

104
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:36,380
How could you lie to me and go 
boozing with your friends, Varun?

105
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:41,210
You just apologized. 
Why stir it up again?

106
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,920
You should say sorry to me.

107
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,670
I faked it because you were 
play-acting.

108
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:50,130
I can't waste my precious fertile days.

109
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,000
You mean...

110
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:55,500
...you weren't really sorry?

111
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,670
You're disgusting!

112
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,920
Let's have dinner. 
Then we'll do it again.

113
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,500
Do it again?

114
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:07,340
- Do what again? 
- What we just did.

115
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,130
Have you no pity on me?

116
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:12,790
My insides are drained. I'm just 
blowing smoke rings.

117
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,290
I can't do it. No chance.

118
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,540
No. Can't be done.

119
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,740
- Varun... 
- I...

120
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,800
I've had it.

121
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,040
Thank you.

122
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:34,090
I'm sorry to keep forcing you, 
but it's so important.

123
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:39,420
This time I've got really 
positive vibes. I can feel it.

124
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:46,210
Deepu, put your legs down, please.

125
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,380
Don't try your yoga poses. 
No point.

126
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,710
Why?

127
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:54,290
Nothing happened.

128
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,980
I was just faking it.

129
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,180
I made the right noises, that's all.

130
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,640
What?

131
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:06,230
You guys can fake it too?

132
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:08,850
It's not rocket science.

133
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:11,230
All we do is make weird faces 
and grunt.

134
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:16,780
This is wrong. Unfair. Deepu!

135
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:20,480
I can't do it.

136
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,160
If I try any harder, 
I'll end up with a hernia.

137
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,900
What now? You're drinking water?

138
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:27,230
What are you doing, Deepu? 
Deepu!

139
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:30,270
- Where do I sleep? 
- On the sofa.

140
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:53,930
Mister, if we go any slower, 
we'll be rolling backwards.

141
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:56,770
Faster, please.

142
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:59,600
We're gonna miss our flight.

143
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,680
What's come over you?

144
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:06,100
The idea of kids scared you 
two years ago and now...

145
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:09,020
Your career was top priority then.

146
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:12,060
Can't I want something too? 
Unbelievable.

147
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,240
I'll be the one delivering, 
putting my career on hold.

148
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:17,520
Can't believe it.

149
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,390
You were at it again at dawn.

150
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:21,730
No tea, coffee or breakfast.

151
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:24,600
"Baby, let's try again."

152
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:28,610
If you get pregnant this time, 
we'll tell the baby:

153
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:30,610
"Papa created you 
on an empty stomach."

154
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,360
I'm ovulating, Varun.

155
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,320
There's a party at our Delhi home 
this evening. Be reasonable.

156
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,070
We have a flight to catch 
and Mummy keeps calling 24/7.

157
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:43,230
She won't stop texting either. 
Does it have to be today?

158
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:45,690
Oh! I'm sorry.

159
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:49,990
I'll tell my ovaries not to release 
any eggs when there's a family do.

160
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:52,650
They can release eggs any time, 
but must I slog?

161
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,440
Sir, sorry to interrupt.

162
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:57,900
Ovulation takes place about 14 days 
before the expected date.

163
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,270
Females can conceive only then.

164
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:01,900
But we men...

165
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,690
...can produce millions of sperm 
every day.

166
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:07,770
So it's important to try 
on the right date.

167
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:10,520
I should know. My kids...

168
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,270
Tia and Aryan.

169
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:19,590
Keep using Uber! Looks like their 
drivers are qualified doctors.

170
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:31,110
Ladies and gentlemen, 
you may now unfasten your seat belts.

171
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:34,980
You may now use the washroom 
and your electronic devices.

172
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:38,860
- Let me help you. 
- It's fine.

173
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:43,520
- Excuse me? Could you help me? 
- Sure.

174
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:45,900
The brown one.

175
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,570
Thank you.

176
00:13:58,690 --> 00:13:59,940
I'm really sorry, but I have to ask.

177
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:03,230
Don't you write a column in 
"Entertainment Magazine 60mm?"

178
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,440
Deepti Batra?

179
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:06,980
Yeah.

180
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:10,860
- I thought only I read my columns. 
- No, not at all.

181
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:14,190
Every time I read your column, 
I thank God I'm not illiterate.

182
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:17,270
Do you mind a selfie?

183
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,070
- Sure. 
- Thanks.

184
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:28,570
Excuse me. You're photobombing us.

185
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:30,190
Thanks.

186
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,020
Thank you.

187
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,820
My Insta's gonna go off the hook!

188
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:42,190
- Excuse me. Could you sit over here? 
- No, we're fine, thank you.

189
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:45,150
She's my wife.

190
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,230
Sit here then.

191
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:52,400
Excuse me. 
What are you doing?

192
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,820
I think madam is angry.

193
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,320
It happens.

194
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:06,480
Maybe she asked you for something 
you couldn't give her.

195
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,520
May I be of any help?

196
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,980
Stick to selfies.

197
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,360
You were right.

198
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:24,770
We won't get a chance in Delhi 
with our relatives around.

199
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,770
Our only chance is to do what 
we have to before we land.

200
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:51,440
My wife is ovulating.

201
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,520
What's wrong, Deepu?

202
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:21,520
Now I know how a cricket team feels...

203
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,320
...when they return home 
without a trophy.

204
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,440
Meaning?

205
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,720
We're seeing your parents again 
without any "good news."

206
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,690
My parents know you're 
the ace batsman Virat Kohli.

207
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:35,150
One day you'll bring 
the trophy home.

208
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:40,070
Virat Kohli has a team of ten, 
all I have is you.

209
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:41,900
I'm trying. What about the flight...?

210
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:44,490
- Here comes the Mumbai family! 
- Mama!

211
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,230
Welcome, welcome!

212
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:50,440
God bless you with a healthy child.

213
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:54,110
- Where's Papa? 
- Buying peanuts for Lohri.

214
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:58,230
You two must rest now. 
We'll leave at 5pm.

215
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:01,480
Son, how's your slip-dicks?

216
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,900
It's "slipped disc." Ma!

217
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:05,440
This is a disc.

218
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,400
- OK! Your backache. 
- It's fine.

219
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,930
- Where are you going? 
- To the beauty parlor.

220
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:14,230
- We'll be ready by 5. 
- Don't be late. See you.

221
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,490
My brother is here.

222
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:44,430
Thank you for coming. 
I'm so glad you're here.

223
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:48,920
You've lost so much weight. 
Give me some dieting tips.

224
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,670
It's time to gain weight, 
not lose it.

225
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:55,010
Why explain it to the children? 
They never listen.

226
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:58,520
- Why are you so skinny? 
- I've been working out, Mom.

227
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,630
Look, what a cute kid!

228
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:03,960
Why did you call him "Holaram?"

229
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:07,000
Granny insisted on the name.

230
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:09,050
Grandpa's name was Ram...

231
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:10,670
...and our son was born on Holi.

232
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,880
So she named him "Holaram."

233
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:17,000
Good job he wasn't born on Lohri, 
he'd be called a peanut!

234
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,340
- Why must you put your foot in it? 
- I didn't do it deliberately.

235
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,620
I didn't even realize it.

236
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,170
Come.

237
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,590
Now say sorry to everyone.

238
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:35,880
Sorry. Sorry, everyone.

239
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,170
Never mind!

240
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:40,300
I'm changing Holaram's name 
before he starts school...

241
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:41,920
...before he changes his parents.

242
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,710
Congratulations!

243
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:48,220
Congratulations on Hole's first Lohri.

244
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,740
A gift for you.

245
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,300
It's "Hola" and not "Hole".

246
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:55,460
As if either name made any sense. 
By God!

247
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:00,550
Is that your Mumbai sister-in-law?

248
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:02,630
I'll say a quick hello.

249
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:06,460
Hello! Do you recognize me?

250
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:09,340
Yes, of course.

251
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:14,210
You're looking gorgeous. 
Where's your husband?

252
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:16,840
He's actually at the bar.

253
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:19,750
- How long have you been married? 
- Seven years.

254
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,300
Seven years? Children?

255
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:25,090
Actually, I'm really busy 
with my job, so...

256
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:27,590
That's just an excuse.

257
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:31,050
You're at the right age to have kids, 
make the in-laws happy.

258
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:35,220
So they'll have a little toy 
to play with!

259
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,800
Yes, of course, aunty.

260
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,210
- Glass of wine? 
- Yeah!

261
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:40,590
- See you later. 
- No problem.

262
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:45,420
Relax, sister-in-law. 
Ignore these silly aunties.

263
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:48,420
- How are you, Deepu? 
- I don't have kids!

264
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,120
I came to wish you Happy Lohri.

265
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,760
Sorry, aunty. Happy Lohri!

266
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,510
- Happy Lohri, aunty. 
- Happy Lohri. Bless you.

267
00:19:57,590 --> 00:20:00,210
As I was saying, don't pay 
attention to them.

268
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,630
Tell you what...

269
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,300
...if you're having trouble conceiving, 
I have an idea.

270
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,550
I know this amazing healer.

271
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:10,880
He just has to take one look at you 
and your work is done.

272
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,670
Shall I talk to him?

273
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:15,880
Aunty! Mom's looking for you.

274
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,170
She phoned you three times. 
She's over there, waiting.

275
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:21,880
I'd better go to her.

276
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,550
Think it over.

277
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:28,670
I swear! If I hear the word "baby" 
again, I'll punch someone in the face.

278
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,500
- Ma'am, you want a baby...? 
- No, I don't want...

279
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:34,880
What happened?

280
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:38,670
He meant "baby corn".

281
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:41,920
I know, but...

282
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,130
We're sorry, baby.

283
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:01,420
Girls and boys, 
get ready to dance the bhangra

284
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:15,760
We'll dance all night

285
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,460
How it teases me

286
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,590
Takes my breath away

287
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:28,080
Your red flowing skirt

288
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:35,980
It robs me of sleep

289
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:42,940
Sweetheart, your red flowing skirt

290
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:21,550
My fair skin, 
dark kohl in my eyes

291
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:25,050
You keep waiting for me, 
I won't be vain

292
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,550
When you dance, everyone dances 
You set hearts on fire

293
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:46,210
No one is safe 
when you sway your hips

294
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:49,840
Let's get crazy!

295
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,920
How it teases you

296
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,420
How it steals your heart

297
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,210
My red flowing skirt

298
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,160
I can't sleep at nights

299
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:17,130
My red flowing skirt

300
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:20,530
Sweetheart, your red flowing skirt

301
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,800
Hola is such a cutie!

302
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:09,800
I told you, I only watch kiddy TV 
when I'm pregnant.

303
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,210
He's the result!

304
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:14,960
What Channel did Vivek's parents watch? 
Animal Planet?

305
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:18,750
Keep your trap shut, please!

306
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:23,420
We called you here to discuss 
something important.

307
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:25,050
No prizes for what that is.

308
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:27,550
We're trying to have kids.

309
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,710
But he makes me feel like 
he's doing me a big favor.

310
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:36,800
- Don't start that again. 
- Relax, brother. We're family.

311
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:39,960
If you can't talk to us, 
then who can you talk to?

312
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:43,130
Deepu is right. Keep trying.

313
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:46,380
We were at it three times a day. 
Ask him! We tried every position:

314
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:49,840
- Missionary, spooning, dog and... 
- That'll do.

315
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,750
Spare us the details.

316
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:56,710
Frankly, I'm sick and tired 
of this subject.

317
00:24:57,090 --> 00:25:00,170
Sometimes I get confused. 
Do we really want kids...

318
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:03,750
...or is it because society wants us 
to have them?

319
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:07,380
Facebook and Twitter are full of 
images of celebrity kids.

320
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:10,380
If you have kids, keep them 
out of sight.

321
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,970
Stop making us jealous. 
Don't show off.

322
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:14,880
What about old age?

323
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:17,340
Our children will take care 
of our needs.

324
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,460
That's what they all say.

325
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:20,840
But we're not gonna produce 
the next billionaire!

326
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:25,380
We'll have kids with funny pet names. 
We'll turn grey wiping his nose.

327
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:28,880
And when relatives come over and say, 
"So sweet!"

328
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,000
He'll poop his pants.

329
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:33,250
They'll hand him back to us saying: 
"Clean him up and bring him back."

330
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:36,300
Then they'll make gurgling sounds 
at the kid.

331
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,460
We feed him, he'll poop again.

332
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:42,170
We feed him, he'll poop again.

333
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:45,710
- Another beer? 
- Let me finish this one.

334
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:54,340
Who is Dr. Joshi? 
Why are you texting me his number?

335
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:57,050
He's Mumbai's top fertility specialist.

336
00:25:57,170 --> 00:25:58,950
No harm in seeing him once.

337
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:00,500
I don't want to see him.

338
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:03,340
I don't want to see a sexologist. 
No chance.

339
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:06,720
Varun, which century do you live in?

340
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:10,380
Just a minute, sister-in-law. 
Varun, remember Cherry?

341
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,900
Aunt Anu's daughter?

342
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:15,840
She and her husband tried 
for five years.

343
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,380
Five long years.

344
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:21,160
Finally, they went to Mumbai 
and met Dr Joshi.

345
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:23,380
And a year later, guess what?

346
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:25,880
She had two healthy kids.

347
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:28,830
One kid every six months?

348
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,760
Hell, no, idiot! Twins.

349
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,920
- Be more precise. 
- They had twins.

350
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:37,800
There's no shame in meeting 
the doctor.

351
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,960
Dr Joshi's the best, brother.

352
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:42,210
Just go and see him.

353
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,000
OK, we'll see him.

354
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,840
Happy now?

355
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:51,920
Much obliged.

356
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,000
Nothing makes her happy.

357
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:12,550
Why are test tube babies only white?

358
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:14,710
Doesn't the doctor do Indian babies?

359
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:20,500
Mr and Mrs Patra? 
Dr Joshi will see you now.

360
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:24,250
It's Mr and Mrs Batra.

361
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:26,380
I'm sorry, my bad.

362
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:27,920
Thank you, Puzie.

363
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:29,670
It's "Suzie."

364
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:31,670
Sorry. My bad.

365
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:44,090
Hello.

366
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:48,460
Please have a seat, Mr and Mrs Batra.

367
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:55,880
I've read your reports.

368
00:27:57,130 --> 00:27:58,300
Tell me something.

369
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:01,960
How are your relations 
with your wife?

370
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:08,110
We're fighting now, but we're good.

371
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,460
He means "relations".

372
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:16,130
- You mean our sex life? 
- Yes. Frequency?

373
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,570
- 16. 
- 2.

374
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:24,130
How often?

375
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:25,550
- Every week. 
- Every month.

376
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:33,720
I'm sure you know there's 
a big difference between...

377
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,920
...sixteen times a week 
and twice a month.

378
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:42,050
Anyway, the reports 
are not that great.

379
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:46,050
Your egg count is rapidly decreasing.

380
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:47,500
What does that mean?

381
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:51,580
Whatever we do, 
we need to act fast.

382
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:54,630
Doctor, is everything OK with me?

383
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:58,010
Well, let's just say you have 
a few good swimmers left.

384
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:02,050
- Swimmers? Oh! Sperm? 
- Yes.

385
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:05,300
Now listen to me carefully.

386
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:09,500
You have strong swimmers.

387
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:14,170
But they faint the minute they enter 
her universe.

388
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,920
Faint? Why?

389
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,630
Don't worry. 
It's very common at your age.

390
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:21,750
Now listen to me carefully.

391
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:26,170
What we'll do is - we'll take 
Deepti's eggs and your swimmers...

392
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:30,500
...and fertilize them in our lab.

393
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,630
One of the finest labs in India.

394
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:33,920
Sure.

395
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:37,590
And when the embryo is formed, 
we'll put it into your body.

396
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,800
This process is called 
"In vitro fertilization."

397
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,050
IVF.

398
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,840
Perfect, let's do it.

399
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:49,240
Doctor, during the process, will I need 
to take time off work?

400
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:53,010
If you two are serious about wanting 
a child then...

401
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:57,500
...I'd suggest you put your work on hold. 
Focus on getting pregnant.

402
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:59,340
But I can work, can't I?

403
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:02,340
- I can go? 
- What?

404
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:06,420
Of course Mr Batra, you can work.

405
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:08,460
Good.

406
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:14,500
Please have a look at this 
and I'll see you in a minute.

407
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:22,450
What's wrong with you?

408
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:24,000
Wrong with me? 
What's wrong with him?

409
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:26,840
Weirdo! Charging us a fortune...

410
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:29,920
...and making out like he'll conjure up 
a baby for us from heaven.

411
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,960
We're legally married. Why was he 
embarrassed to use the word "sex"?

412
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:36,340
Relations! He must talk to his wife 
like that.

413
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:39,050
"Darling, let's have 'relations' tonight."

414
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,630
Just shut up!

415
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:43,710
What was that nonsense? 
16 times a week!

416
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:45,800
Where was I the other 14 times?

417
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,550
I got nervous.

418
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:51,840
I'm used to doctors asking where I hurt. 
But he asked me about my relations.

419
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:55,000
Not something I discuss every day.

420
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:56,960
Varun, stop annoying me.

421
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,670
- He's a very good doctor. 
- Look at him. A very good doctor.

422
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:06,670
Please come.

423
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,710
Come on, let's go.

424
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:19,920
This lab is 12,000 sq. ft. 
They must be minting money here.

425
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:23,610
So this is where we create life.

426
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:42,920
Wow!

427
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:46,840
All new machines. 
Absolutely fresh!

428
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:51,300
Doctor, who's she?

429
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,210
She is my wife, Dr Joshi.

430
00:31:58,290 --> 00:31:59,340
Oh, OK.

431
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:00,670
Why?

432
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:03,170
Nothing, just...

433
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:07,460
May I ask something, doctor?

434
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,800
What if my eggs don't fertilize?

435
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:13,590
Then we can use donor eggs.

436
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,050
Meaning?

437
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:19,840
We can use the eggs of a young lady 
and fertilize them with your sperm.

438
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:22,250
Then plant them in Deepti.

439
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:26,340
You guys are really stubborn. Good.

440
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:29,000
Turning couples into parents 
is an art.

441
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:33,380
Do you really believe these celebs 
who become parents in old age...

442
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:36,300
- ...use their stardom to have kids? 
- True.

443
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:39,130
But isn't it easier just to adopt?

444
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,960
Then why didn't you?

445
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:49,000
The obsession of carrying forward 
one's genes is an old deep-rooted one.

446
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:51,800
Please come.

447
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,460
Ask something. 
Take some interest.

448
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:59,670
Doctor, I have a question.

449
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:03,800
I was just thinking, we're so 
medically advanced now...

450
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:07,380
...is there a way for a man 
to get pregnant?

451
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:08,500
Of course.

452
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:13,740
In fact, in 2017, a man in the UK 
gave birth to a healthy baby girl.

453
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:15,920
The man was a woman first.

454
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,130
Her ovaries and private parts 
had been removed.

455
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:22,460
Got it! Spare us the details. 
That's amazing. Thank you.

456
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:25,800
The nurse will explain everything 
to you.

457
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:29,470
You'll be administered hormone 
injections till your next cycle.

458
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:31,500
You may have major mood swings.

459
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:32,630
Let me warn you.

460
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:35,840
The process is draining, 
emotionally and financially.

461
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,500
So be prepared.

462
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,460
Mr Batra, can you give us 
a semen sample?

463
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:43,000
And Deepti, I'll see you on day two 
of your next cycle.

464
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,460
- This is yours. 
- Thank you.

465
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:47,090
- All the best. 
- Thank you.

466
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:53,500
Bobby, bet 13,500 rupees for me.

467
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:55,590
All on India. OK?

468
00:33:57,380 --> 00:34:00,550
Sh**! Amateurs!

469
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:03,540
Call for a run! Come on!

470
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:05,300
Where's my match gone?

471
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,060
Why?

472
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:12,970
You're giving your sample today. 
You can't be stressed.

473
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:16,140
You know how stress upsets sperm.

474
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:21,920
Aren't you overdoing it? 
Please, it's the semi-finals.

475
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,210
My sperm want to watch too. 
Don't upset them.

476
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:27,670
If they get upset, 
we'll never have children.

477
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:29,670
You find this funny, Varun?

478
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:32,630
Stop talking rubbish. 
Go! Do it properly.

479
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:34,090
Properly?

480
00:34:35,170 --> 00:34:38,340
Feed me some honey for good luck! 
This is not an exam.

481
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:41,300
I'm so tense as it is. 
What'll happen there?

482
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:44,130
Please go, Varun.

483
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,960
Another wicket down.

484
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,050
- Varun? 
- Going!

485
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:49,340
Going!

486
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:55,300
I'll watch on the phone. 
Do as you please.

487
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:56,920
My team's losing.

488
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:10,920
- Excuse me. 
- Yes, sir?

489
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:12,380
I have an appointment.

490
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,170
For what, sir?

491
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,840
Sample.

492
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:17,710
Sorry, sir?

493
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:20,300
Check my name in your system.

494
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:22,260
Your name?

495
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:23,960
Varun Batra.

496
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:28,710
You're here to give a semen sample.

497
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,920
Don't be embarrassed. 
They're all here for the same reason.

498
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,840
Here's your bottle.

499
00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:40,760
Sit in the waiting area.

500
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:43,460
Could you put it in a plastic bag?

501
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,050
Sir, plastic is banned.

502
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:47,510
So is this made of metal?

503
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:52,210
Mr Pendekar, please come.

504
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:59,930
Now listen to me carefully. If you want to 
entrust your dreams of parenthood...

505
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:03,590
...to safe hands, 
then don't hesitate coming to us.

506
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:05,720
Look at the clock above your head.

507
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:09,510
You'll know how many healthy kids 
we've brought into this world.

508
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:12,130
We can guarantee you one thing...

509
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:14,960
Good news!

510
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:21,800
Please help.

511
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:28,500
Mr Batra!

512
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,890
Please come. 
Your super-deluxe room is ready.

513
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:35,590
I say! Super-deluxe?

514
00:37:10,210 --> 00:37:11,300
Varun, all done?

515
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:13,510
Deepu, it's very tough.

516
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:16,840
It's like a gun is pointed at my head 
and a voice booming: "Do it now!"

517
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,520
It's biologically impossible.

518
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,380
Varun, I seriously can't do this 
right now.

519
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:22,710
I have an interview 
with the star Katrina.

520
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:24,880
You don't care 
what I'm going through.

521
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:29,380
They gave me magazines and 
DVDs to get me started. Seriously!

522
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,840
Am I a teenager?

523
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:38,010
Baby, at your granny's memorial 
service...

524
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:41,630
...while everyone was mourning, 
what were we up to?

525
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:43,920
This is nothing.

526
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:46,380
Stop agonizing! Just do it.

527
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:50,880
Can you help me? 
Talk dirty to me.

528
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,130
You nuts? Stop behaving like a kid!

529
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:55,940
- Then give the phone to Katrina. 
- Shut up!

530
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:16,050
It seems we're all ready to go.

531
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:18,670
Now listen to me carefully.

532
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:23,010
This is the last stage of the IVF 
procedure. The embryo transfer.

533
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:27,510
The most delicate and critical 
procedure.

534
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:28,850
They're interns.

535
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:33,300
- Shouldn't they be more experienced? 
- They're just kids.

536
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:35,090
Understand?

537
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:38,880
Sir, the swelling on the outer lining? 
Is it normal?

538
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:42,920
Absolutely normal. It could be 
a reaction to the medication.

539
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:48,050
Doctor, please administer anesthesia. 
I want to be unconscious.

540
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:49,710
Relax, Mrs Batra.

541
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,080
I've done this a thousand times.

542
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:56,750
Now listen to me carefully. I want you 
to shake off that negativity.

543
00:39:56,830 --> 00:40:00,050
It just upsets the embryo.

544
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:03,760
And now I'll say a little prayer.

545
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:09,960
So listen carefully.

546
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:14,920
Close your eyes. Let your positive 
energy flow into this embryo.

547
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,800
You too.

548
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,210
Not you two, idiots!

549
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:27,010
- Focus your mind here. 
- Sorry.

550
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:30,630
"O Mother of Life..."

551
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:33,880
Doctor, should I repeat after you?

552
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,010
No, just listen!

553
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:40,900
"O Mother of Life. 
O Father of the Universe.

554
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:44,960
"Bless us...

555
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,050
"...with the gift of a child.

556
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:52,050
"With the gift of generations.

557
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,050
"With the gift of love."

558
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:05,050
Congratulations!

559
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:07,210
The procedure has been successful.

560
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:09,460
We'll do a pregnancy test in 14 days.

561
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,050
Till then take extra care 
of yourself.

562
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:13,590
Remember...

563
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:17,340
...the greatest enemy of an embryo 
is stress. So no stressing.

564
00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:20,050
Don't set your expectations too high.

565
00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:25,320
The next 14 days are the 
most difficult and...

566
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,420
...crucial.

567
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,630
Crucial time.

568
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:33,030
So be absolutely calm.

569
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:34,630
Thank you.

570
00:41:54,670 --> 00:41:57,960
It feels so good to fall in love

571
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:01,380
But how I fell I'll never know

572
00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:05,430
The way we kiss, the way we touch

573
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:08,570
My heart will never know

574
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:13,770
We kept talking as 
the evening turned to night

575
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:20,370
Dreams like sparkling stars 
weaved a story for us

576
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:28,300
Eyes spoke innocent words

577
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:34,920
What did they say? 
We listened mesmerized

578
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:39,710
Where is the wind carrying us?

579
00:42:43,870 --> 00:42:47,460
How unaware we were...

580
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:53,320
...when our hearts embraced each other

581
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:57,040
Can't say when it happened

582
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:36,010
It feels so good to fall in love

583
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:39,470
But how I fell I'll never know

584
00:43:40,090 --> 00:43:43,420
The way we kiss, the way we touch

585
00:43:43,710 --> 00:43:46,820
My heart will never know

586
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,050
Dr Joshi's on the line.

587
00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:21,050
It's been only 12 days.

588
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:23,600
Hello?

589
00:44:23,770 --> 00:44:28,160
Mrs Batra, can you both come 
to the clinic for a minor check-up?

590
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:29,050
Right now?

591
00:44:29,590 --> 00:44:30,510
Say no.

592
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:33,760
We're leaving for work. Tomorrow?

593
00:44:34,030 --> 00:44:37,050
Please come straight away. 
It's an emergency check-up.

594
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:39,590
Dr Joshi would also like a word.

595
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:41,630
An emergency checkup?

596
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,670
I guess they know we aren't stressed.

597
00:44:48,090 --> 00:44:49,420
So they want to see us.

598
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:53,330
We can guarantee you one thing...

599
00:44:55,370 --> 00:44:56,370
Good news!

600
00:44:56,520 --> 00:45:00,910
What news on star Alia's interview? 
See you later.

601
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:05,200
This commercial makes me think twice 
about having kids.

602
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:08,070
Why can't they show something 
decent here?

603
00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:10,580
- Like? 
- "Lethal Weapon."

604
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:13,120
- It's a hospital for children. 
- "Baby's Day Out?"

605
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,620
But don't show this. 
Look at him selling parenthood.

606
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:18,550
Keep coming, keep coming. 
Carefully!

607
00:45:22,290 --> 00:45:23,660
Carefully!

608
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:26,830
Greetings, madam.

609
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:29,920
Put them down.

610
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,370
Hey, bro! Keep them here.

611
00:45:34,450 --> 00:45:36,370
What's all this, sir?

612
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:37,620
A gift, madam.

613
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,330
This isn't a hospital. 
It's the house of God...

614
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:43,290
...where human beings are made.

615
00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:45,660
You bless unlucky couples like us.

616
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:48,910
That's very thoughtful of you, sir. 
But gifts aren't allowed.

617
00:45:48,990 --> 00:45:49,610
No gifts?

618
00:45:50,130 --> 00:45:51,750
- No gifts in God's house? 
- No.

619
00:45:51,830 --> 00:45:54,000
You're kidding me.

620
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:56,550
I brought Chandigarh's 
sweetest delicacies.

621
00:45:56,630 --> 00:45:59,830
They're for couples blessed 
with good news. Give them a box...

622
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:01,380
...from me.

623
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:02,700
What's this?

624
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:06,310
Diapers. Give these away too.

625
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:09,190
I'd like to sponsor 
those cute little poops.

626
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:12,390
So babies can let it flow free.

627
00:46:15,310 --> 00:46:18,010
Poop reminds me. Why did you call us?

628
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:23,690
Actually, I feel blessed 
to have a medical problem.

629
00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:27,440
It has given me a reason to visit 
God's house.

630
00:46:29,270 --> 00:46:30,270
By the way, ma'am...

631
00:46:30,390 --> 00:46:33,560
...God wrote this prescription, 
but no one can read it.

632
00:46:33,810 --> 00:46:34,600
Here you go.

633
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:41,300
Just look at the prescription 
on the front. Ignore the back.

634
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:45,310
Amazing! God's handwriting 
is the same, back and front!

635
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:48,480
- The baby has arrived! 
- The baby's here.

636
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,690
The baby has arrived!

637
00:46:52,270 --> 00:46:53,850
She's made a baby in 12 days.

638
00:46:53,930 --> 00:46:58,150
- No, not our baby. Someone else's. 
- Hear that?

639
00:46:58,230 --> 00:47:02,600
Dr Joshi let me watch. 
The cutie was born in front of my eyes.

640
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:06,770
O Mother Goddess, give us 
a cute baby girl too.

641
00:47:06,850 --> 00:47:09,860
If it's a boy, you can dress him 
in a frock.

642
00:47:10,770 --> 00:47:14,020
Fine by us. Girl or boy. 
As long as it's our blood.

643
00:47:15,690 --> 00:47:18,140
What excuse do they have extending 
their family line?

644
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:20,730
Mr and Mrs Batra.

645
00:47:20,850 --> 00:47:22,230
- Yeah. 
- Yes.

646
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:26,940
- You also Batras? 
- Yeah.

647
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:29,190
- Wow! We also! 
- Wow!

648
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:30,890
So which Batras do you want?

649
00:47:31,850 --> 00:47:32,850
All four.

650
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:37,230
I think all the Batras will hear 
good news today.

651
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:41,140
- Batra Day coming up! 
- Come.

652
00:47:42,850 --> 00:47:44,640
- Sir... 
- Please come.

653
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:46,950
Hello.

654
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,230
Please sit.

655
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:58,020
Varun and Deepti, please meet 
the other Batras.

656
00:47:58,430 --> 00:48:00,010
Myself Honey Batra.

657
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:02,390
And she's my dear wife, 
Monika Batra.

658
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:04,190
And here's my card.

659
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:13,980
You keep it.

660
00:48:15,310 --> 00:48:19,440
Doctor, you called us here. 
Is it urgent?

661
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:21,860
- I should be at the office. 
- Yes, yes.

662
00:48:22,010 --> 00:48:24,440
Take your time, doctor. 
We're in no hurry.

663
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:26,810
Sorry, sir.

664
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:31,560
I'll get to the point.

665
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:35,890
We have a small problem.

666
00:48:36,150 --> 00:48:37,390
What problem?

667
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:40,970
Well, the problem is...

668
00:48:41,050 --> 00:48:44,560
It's not the first time. It has happened 
in the US before.

669
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,270
But it's the first time for us.

670
00:48:46,350 --> 00:48:47,560
What is it, doctor?

671
00:48:49,390 --> 00:48:52,560
Well, the thing is...

672
00:48:53,190 --> 00:48:56,190
...there has been a sperm mix-up.

673
00:48:58,100 --> 00:48:58,850
What?

674
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,270
What do you mean "sperm mix-up?"

675
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:05,690
Mixer? Fruit mixer?

676
00:49:05,810 --> 00:49:07,360
Doctor, explain in Hindi.

677
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:12,190
You see Mr Honey, our highly 
experienced embryologists...

678
00:49:12,270 --> 00:49:16,190
...were processing two sets of semen 
at the same time.

679
00:49:16,270 --> 00:49:18,360
Since you share the 
same surname, Batra...

680
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:20,480
...there was a mix-up.

681
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:23,600
Mix-up? Will someone tell me 
what's going on?

682
00:49:23,870 --> 00:49:25,440
You're kidding me?

683
00:49:26,390 --> 00:49:30,870
You mean my wife has 
this baboon's sperm inside her?

684
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:33,480
- What? 
- Don't call me a baboon.

685
00:49:34,810 --> 00:49:36,640
Whose child am I having?

686
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:40,060
What the hell is he saying? 
Explain in Hindi.

687
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:41,770
I'll explain.

688
00:49:42,310 --> 00:49:44,560
This man has put my sperm...

689
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:46,390
...into her.

690
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:48,560
And your sperm went here.

691
00:49:49,190 --> 00:49:50,390
I mean inside her.

692
00:49:50,770 --> 00:49:54,800
You're saying our seeds got mixed up?

693
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:57,940
- Seeds? 
- Our spam!

694
00:49:58,310 --> 00:50:01,940
Impossible! Spam isn't like luggage 
you can mix up.

695
00:50:02,390 --> 00:50:05,390
- Call yourself a doctor! 
- Please be civil.

696
00:50:05,470 --> 00:50:06,900
- Please be civil. 
- Stay calm.

697
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:08,640
Just shut up, guys!

698
00:50:09,230 --> 00:50:11,860
I'm going to sue you. 
I will sue you.

699
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:13,980
- I'm going to sue you guys. 
- That's nothing!

700
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:17,940
You don't know my sister and her husband. 
They're Delhi's top criminal lawyers.

701
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:19,810
My wife's a leading journalist.

702
00:50:19,890 --> 00:50:24,270
Who cares! My uncle is Haryana's 
CM's father-in-law.

703
00:50:24,350 --> 00:50:27,600
I'll get you both 15 years in jail.

704
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:29,310
A minimum of 15 years.

705
00:50:29,390 --> 00:50:31,310
Calm down. Please.

706
00:50:31,390 --> 00:50:35,360
- Is this some joke? 
- Spam is not a song you remix.

707
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:36,560
Calm down.

708
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:38,730
We're very embarrassed. 
It's our fault.

709
00:50:38,810 --> 00:50:41,900
Our technicians made a blunder. 
I'm very sorry.

710
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:44,480
- So sorry. 
- Now listen to me carefully.

711
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:46,940
Say that again and I'll punch you!

712
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:48,850
Now you listen to me.

713
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:53,060
Fix this mess now! Right now!

714
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:56,770
Give me back my spam, madam. 
Doctor, give me back my seed.

715
00:50:56,850 --> 00:51:01,230
No stress. You two will have 
to undergo a minor procedure.

716
00:51:01,310 --> 00:51:03,480
So there's no chance of implantation.

717
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:06,420
Plantation? 
Why doesn't he speak in Hindi?

718
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:07,940
Hindi, please!

719
00:51:08,020 --> 00:51:09,730
So your wives don't get pregnant.

720
00:51:09,810 --> 00:51:13,650
- There's no chance of pregnancy. 
- What if she's already pregnant?

721
00:51:13,730 --> 00:51:15,230
Just tell me what happens then?

722
00:51:15,310 --> 00:51:16,810
We can terminate.

723
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:19,480
It's like a grain of sand. 
A minor DNC will do it.

724
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:22,810
DNC? How's the "Delhi Noida Corporation" 
mixed up in this?

725
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:25,600
We go for an abortion.

726
00:51:25,810 --> 00:51:26,860
Abortion?

727
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:29,610
Are you bloody nuts?

728
00:51:29,690 --> 00:51:34,040
Mrs Batra, your chance of 
pregnancy are low.

729
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:37,810
- Because your ovaries are way too old. 
- Hey! That's not right.

730
00:51:37,890 --> 00:51:41,120
My head's splitting! Let's just go.

731
00:51:42,350 --> 00:51:44,900
- Deepti. 
- You wait and watch.

732
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:46,020
That's the wrong door.

733
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:48,590
As if you got the right woman!

734
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:51,600
Moni...

735
00:51:58,390 --> 00:51:59,790
Can we get a refund?

736
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:19,560
Yes?

737
00:52:20,150 --> 00:52:21,480
Negative.

738
00:52:21,730 --> 00:52:23,560
I'm so relieved.

739
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:27,560
Deepu, let's forget all this.

740
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:32,020
- It's fine if we had children naturally. 
- But?

741
00:52:32,350 --> 00:52:34,480
Aren't we good enough 
for each other?

742
00:52:34,910 --> 00:52:38,140
Being a parent is fulfilling, 
but restrictions come with it.

743
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:44,190
We can't plan a holiday without thinking 
where we can buy baby food.

744
00:52:44,890 --> 00:52:46,230
Worry about school holidays.

745
00:52:46,310 --> 00:52:48,850
Now we can just take off. 
Books our tickets and fly!

746
00:52:49,230 --> 00:52:51,390
Do you realize freedom is priceless?

747
00:52:52,770 --> 00:52:55,480
Varun, I can't believe 
you're saying this.

748
00:52:56,730 --> 00:52:58,690
- Goodnight, Varun. 
- Goodnight.

749
00:52:58,810 --> 00:53:00,190
Don't switch the light off.

750
00:53:01,890 --> 00:53:03,200
Push.

751
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:05,560
Deepu, push.

752
00:53:05,730 --> 00:53:06,440
Push!

753
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:08,690
Say Moosa!

754
00:53:08,770 --> 00:53:09,520
Just relax.

755
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:12,980
Think of a valley, a mountain, 
Mahabaleshwar.

756
00:53:13,310 --> 00:53:15,870
- OK, no Mahabaleshwar. 
- Push!

757
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:18,640
That's good. Good.

758
00:53:20,190 --> 00:53:21,940
It's here!

759
00:53:27,810 --> 00:53:29,230
Hello-ji!

760
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:38,890
What's wrong? Are you OK?

761
00:53:42,890 --> 00:53:43,690
Deepu!

762
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:03,350
Deepu, are you OK?

763
00:54:03,930 --> 00:54:05,140
Yeah, I'm OK.

764
00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:09,230
I had a bad dream. Now that I'm awake, 
I'll go for a walk.

765
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:11,060
Go back to sleep, honey.

766
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:15,640
"Honey!"

767
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:25,940
Right, left. Up and down.

768
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:31,640
Yes, like this.

769
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:35,730
Zumba's the coolest

770
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:45,610
Young girl, filling water at the well

771
00:54:45,690 --> 00:54:48,040
Don't wash your delicate feet

772
00:54:52,690 --> 00:54:56,760
The champa flowers have blossomed, 
make your wedding garland

773
00:55:01,850 --> 00:55:06,170
The world's a dry crust of bread. 
My heart's a buttery paratha

774
00:55:06,390 --> 00:55:10,710
Baby, choose what you will. 
Sway your hips

775
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:14,900
Dance the bhangra with me. 
Shake your booty!

776
00:55:14,980 --> 00:55:16,730
Zumba's the coolest

777
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:23,130
Even cooler when a Sardar 
wiggles the Zumba

778
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:31,480
My dancing feet will shake 
the earth today

779
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:33,520
Young girl, filling water at the well

780
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:35,740
Don't wash your delicate feet

781
00:55:40,690 --> 00:55:44,640
The champa flowers have blossomed, 
make your wedding garland

782
00:55:48,730 --> 00:55:50,210
Zumba!

783
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:00,480
Move your feet

784
00:56:00,910 --> 00:56:03,150
Sway your hips

785
00:56:03,230 --> 00:56:07,470
Shame's like cholesterol. 
Get it out of your system!

786
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:26,010
Come with me, shake your booty. 
Why stand frozen like a pillar?

787
00:56:26,090 --> 00:56:30,620
You'll lose weight, you'll look younger 
if we all did the Zumba!

788
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:34,600
Zumba's the coolest

789
00:56:37,230 --> 00:56:40,490
Even cooler when a Sardar 
wiggles the Zumba

790
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:51,460
Zumba's the coolest

791
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:10,520
Even cooler when a Sardar 
wiggles the Zumba

792
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:16,540
Zumba's the coolest

793
00:57:17,290 --> 00:57:19,350
Moni! Moni!

794
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:34,230
Excuse me.

795
00:57:35,890 --> 00:57:37,310
Madam, the medicines.

796
00:57:37,850 --> 00:57:40,190
Are Moni's reports in? 
Monika Batra.

797
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:41,900
- Is she your wife? 
- Yes.

798
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:44,940
Sir, don't you recognize me?

799
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:46,890
It's me, Lalita.

800
00:57:47,730 --> 00:57:49,140
I was at your wedding.

801
00:57:49,820 --> 00:57:51,980
Remember the buffet?

802
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:54,310
The chole-kulcha? The food counter?

803
00:57:54,390 --> 00:57:56,940
That tasted rotten. 
The cook was arrested.

804
00:57:57,020 --> 00:58:00,900
You mean my husband? We came to 
your wedding together.

805
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:03,440
- I made the... 
- Moni, are you OK?

806
00:58:03,770 --> 00:58:06,310
- What does the report say? 
- I'll get it.

807
00:58:06,490 --> 00:58:07,390
Are you OK?

808
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:17,020
I feel more comfortable with you.

809
00:58:17,270 --> 00:58:18,770
That's why I asked for you.

810
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:20,640
Me too.

811
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:26,390
I'm glad.

812
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:30,640
If we can undo our mistake, 
we'd be very happy.

813
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:35,520
The endometrium lining seems 
a little thick. But it's normal.

814
00:58:40,690 --> 00:58:41,980
What's wrong, doctor?

815
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:47,060
I think I see the sac.

816
00:58:50,420 --> 00:58:51,560
What do you mean?

817
00:58:56,810 --> 00:58:59,300
I think she's pregnant.

818
00:59:01,890 --> 00:59:04,470
Time to celebrate. It's good news!

819
00:59:20,230 --> 00:59:23,270
We can guarantee you one thing:

820
00:59:24,730 --> 00:59:26,060
Good news!

821
00:59:32,270 --> 00:59:34,270
How can you be so irresponsible?

822
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:37,020
You're always playing Hitler 
with me.

823
00:59:37,310 --> 00:59:38,850
Why didn't you take the pill?

824
00:59:40,060 --> 00:59:42,350
The test results were negative.

825
00:59:42,430 --> 00:59:45,900
So I didn't want to tamper 
with my system.

826
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:50,950
Tamper? It's one tiny bloody pill. 
How's that tampering?

827
00:59:51,430 --> 00:59:55,230
- Varun, you're so insensitive. 
- I'm insensitive?

828
00:59:55,310 --> 00:59:57,560
Someone up there must be laughing.

829
00:59:57,640 --> 00:59:59,850
"They tried so many times in vain.

830
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:03,240
"But when they weren't trying..." 
We got good news!

831
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:05,220
Go!

832
01:00:06,810 --> 01:00:08,560
It's a hospital zone. No honking.

833
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:11,220
Let's abort.

834
01:00:11,930 --> 01:00:13,060
What is it?

835
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:15,470
What's wrong?

836
01:00:16,970 --> 01:00:18,350
I was just thinking.

837
01:00:18,430 --> 01:00:22,390
What if Monika is carrying 
your child?

838
01:00:22,470 --> 01:00:26,080
Impossible! 
Remember what Dr Joshi said.

839
01:00:26,250 --> 01:00:29,130
My sperm faints when it enters 
your universe.

840
01:00:29,310 --> 01:00:33,470
They would've fainted entering Monika. 
Or died on the spot.

841
01:00:33,890 --> 01:00:37,020
Stop scaring me. 
She can't be pregnant.

842
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:40,200
She can't be, right?

843
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:59,270
- Don't tell anyone. 
- Why not?

844
01:00:59,410 --> 01:01:01,220
Don't tell the family now.

845
01:01:04,810 --> 01:01:07,020
Here come my children 
with good news!

846
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:08,680
Bless you!

847
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:12,720
My sweet future father. 
Let's celebrate.

848
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:15,180
A beautiful day for good news.

849
01:01:15,260 --> 01:01:18,810
I had arranged a prayer meeting, 
then we heard the good news.

850
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:21,690
- Who told you? 
- Lalita.

851
01:01:22,270 --> 01:01:24,680
- The receptionist? The wedding cook? 
- Yes.

852
01:01:24,970 --> 01:01:26,640
She told her mother.

853
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:29,690
Her mother told her mother-in-law. 
And her mother-in-law told me.

854
01:01:29,770 --> 01:01:32,060
And you told all of Chandigarh.

855
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:35,010
They're here for the prayer meeting.

856
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:36,640
OK.

857
01:01:37,020 --> 01:01:41,190
Come, son. Go, distribute gifts 
to the married ladies.

858
01:01:41,270 --> 01:01:44,390
Your turn, Mummy. Don't drag me 
into this ladies business.

859
01:01:44,470 --> 01:01:45,350
Have mine.

860
01:01:48,020 --> 01:01:49,340
What's wrong with him?

861
01:01:49,850 --> 01:01:50,770
Wait!

862
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:53,370
- Congratulations! 
- Scoot!

863
01:01:53,450 --> 01:01:54,600
Take this.

864
01:01:56,810 --> 01:01:58,600
What's come over you?

865
01:02:01,310 --> 01:02:05,140
I've been practising this line 
for six years.

866
01:02:06,100 --> 01:02:07,180
"Listen..."

867
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:11,700
"I'm going to be the mother 
of your child"

868
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:17,700
I've been dying to hear you say 
those words.

869
01:02:18,850 --> 01:02:20,600
But basically...

870
01:02:22,850 --> 01:02:26,100
- You're not carrying my child. 
- Then whose is it?

871
01:02:26,270 --> 01:02:27,810
Don't you remember?

872
01:02:29,380 --> 01:02:32,980
- Spam mix! 
- You still on about that?

873
01:02:33,110 --> 01:02:35,680
What mix-up? It's not funny.

874
01:02:36,060 --> 01:02:37,430
It's Mother Goddess's blessings.

875
01:02:37,580 --> 01:02:40,270
So why didn't She bless us before?

876
01:02:40,470 --> 01:02:42,470
What's so special about me now?

877
01:02:43,060 --> 01:02:45,470
Sit over there.

878
01:02:46,470 --> 01:02:47,720
Sit down!

879
01:02:51,970 --> 01:02:53,560
Tell me something.

880
01:02:53,810 --> 01:02:58,970
We lived in different cities. 
Who brought us together at Aunt Pinky's?

881
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:03,790
- Aunty Pinky. 
- Rubbish! It was Mother Goddess.

882
01:03:04,750 --> 01:03:06,810
You went quiet when you saw me.

883
01:03:07,100 --> 01:03:10,270
Who gave you the sense 
to say hello to me four days later?

884
01:03:13,810 --> 01:03:14,810
Mother Goddess.

885
01:03:15,310 --> 01:03:18,310
She saved your business, 
our crops and even saved you...

886
01:03:18,390 --> 01:03:20,480
...when you had pneumonia.

887
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:23,250
She made Mummy's knee surgery 
go well. Who did?

888
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:24,730
Mother Goddess.

889
01:03:24,810 --> 01:03:28,840
When She performed miracles for us, 
you never doubted Her.

890
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:31,390
She has blessed our lives.

891
01:03:36,670 --> 01:03:39,440
Doubting Her miracles is doubting Her.

892
01:03:46,770 --> 01:03:49,180
- Sorry, Moni. 
- It's OK.

893
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:51,980
I should not doubt Her blessings.

894
01:03:52,470 --> 01:03:53,640
It's OK.

895
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:55,100
Glory to the Goddess!

896
01:04:30,890 --> 01:04:31,850
Hello?

897
01:04:32,220 --> 01:04:34,470
Hello, brother. It's Honey.

898
01:04:35,030 --> 01:04:36,940
Honey, who? Wrong number.

899
01:04:37,020 --> 01:04:39,400
I dialed the right number. 
It's Honey Batra.

900
01:04:39,850 --> 01:04:44,080
Remember our spam mix-up 
at Joshi's hospital?

901
01:04:45,810 --> 01:04:48,820
I want to know. Is your wife pregnant?

902
01:04:49,060 --> 01:04:51,930
Hello, have you no sense of decency?

903
01:04:53,030 --> 01:04:54,950
Talking nonsense at this hour.

904
01:04:55,350 --> 01:04:57,770
Time has nothing to do 
with talking nonsense.

905
01:04:58,050 --> 01:05:02,530
I'm serious. You see my wife Moni 
is pregnant.

906
01:05:04,970 --> 01:05:08,630
- What? 
- Yes. Your wife, too?

907
01:05:10,310 --> 01:05:12,980
What's it to you if she were?

908
01:05:13,060 --> 01:05:16,810
It has everything to do with me. 
The kid will have my qualities.

909
01:05:16,890 --> 01:05:18,800
What qualities?

910
01:05:19,550 --> 01:05:23,680
I wouldn't even buy ice-cream 
of your quality!

911
01:05:24,150 --> 01:05:25,720
Don't you dare call back!

912
01:05:28,700 --> 01:05:29,680
Hello...

913
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:36,270
He wouldn't even buy ice-cream 
of my quality.

914
01:05:38,250 --> 01:05:39,060
Moni.

915
01:05:40,410 --> 01:05:42,020
What's going on?

916
01:05:42,350 --> 01:05:46,120
You're pregnant, she's pregnant. 
Imagine the soup we're in now.

917
01:05:47,930 --> 01:05:49,970
What if they don't let us abort?

918
01:05:50,050 --> 01:05:52,220
Why not? 
They're not ruling the country.

919
01:05:52,580 --> 01:05:54,350
It's your body, do what you like.

920
01:05:55,030 --> 01:05:58,180
- Are you sure? 
- Sure? Hell, I'm no expert.

921
01:05:58,420 --> 01:06:00,180
This is a first for me too.

922
01:06:00,570 --> 01:06:04,350
Yes, but his wife is carrying 
your baby...

923
01:06:04,430 --> 01:06:07,810
- It's not a baby yet. 
- I know that.

924
01:06:08,980 --> 01:06:10,220
What now, Varun?

925
01:06:17,130 --> 01:06:18,680
Where's your phone?

926
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:21,390
Password?

927
01:06:21,590 --> 01:06:22,420
00...

928
01:06:23,850 --> 01:06:24,930
0000.

929
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:28,790
How innovative!

930
01:06:32,150 --> 01:06:35,600
Go to sleep, please. 
Let us sleep.

931
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:37,970
Hola, please be quiet!

932
01:06:38,050 --> 01:06:42,180
I told you, Richa, don't call him Hola.

933
01:06:42,260 --> 01:06:44,630
- Please. 
- OK, OK.

934
01:06:44,770 --> 01:06:46,720
- What's wrong? 
- Yes, Varun?

935
01:06:46,950 --> 01:06:48,680
Sorry to call so late.

936
01:06:48,810 --> 01:06:50,890
Is your hearing on Friday in Mumbai?

937
01:06:51,230 --> 01:06:52,270
That's right.

938
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:54,850
- Can you come on Thursday? 
- What's wrong?

939
01:06:55,880 --> 01:06:57,390
Just come, I'll tell you.

940
01:06:57,470 --> 01:06:59,530
Take this monster, please.

941
01:07:00,350 --> 01:07:03,310
Listen, I gotta go. I'll talk to Richa.

942
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:05,630
Don't call him a monster.

943
01:07:06,100 --> 01:07:08,310
Varun, please, not my phone.

944
01:07:08,390 --> 01:07:09,470
OK. Sorry.

945
01:07:09,810 --> 01:07:10,970
What's wrong?

946
01:07:11,380 --> 01:07:12,520
Moni...

947
01:07:14,310 --> 01:07:15,600
...she's definitely pregnant.

948
01:07:15,890 --> 01:07:16,970
Who?

949
01:07:17,420 --> 01:07:19,230
- That snooty chick? 
- Yep.

950
01:07:19,640 --> 01:07:21,390
You should be happy.

951
01:07:21,590 --> 01:07:23,890
You'll have two kids.

952
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:26,230
Ours and theirs.

953
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:28,890
That's all very well.

954
01:07:29,580 --> 01:07:32,930
But I'm scared they'll drop the kid.

955
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:36,930
Not if they hold it firmly 
in their arms.

956
01:07:37,970 --> 01:07:39,100
I mean...

957
01:07:39,310 --> 01:07:44,840
...I think he wants his wife 
to have an abortion.

958
01:07:46,230 --> 01:07:49,850
Why would they do that? 
Don't they fear Mother Goddess?

959
01:07:50,140 --> 01:07:53,520
He said he will not have a baby 
with my qualities.

960
01:07:54,430 --> 01:07:56,140
Are they crazy?

961
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:59,120
As if they knew your fine qualities.

962
01:08:01,900 --> 01:08:03,120
What's on your mind?

963
01:08:11,390 --> 01:08:15,170
Pack our bags, Moni. 
We can't let them abort our child.

964
01:08:20,230 --> 01:08:22,210
What the f***!

965
01:08:23,020 --> 01:08:26,560
I mean if we let things 
run their course...

966
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:30,650
...then nine months later 
she'll deliver your child.

967
01:08:31,930 --> 01:08:34,200
And you'll be delivering his child.

968
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:40,930
You recommended that 
guilty quack.

969
01:08:43,310 --> 01:08:46,140
I'm thinking of suing them.

970
01:08:47,390 --> 01:08:49,870
They're making a franchise 
out of my sperm.

971
01:08:50,270 --> 01:08:53,140
We're not suing anyone. 
This is not America...

972
01:08:53,770 --> 01:08:55,930
...where you'll get 
a two million dollar settlement.

973
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:59,440
He's a famous doctor. 
If the media finds out...

974
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:01,560
...they'll have a field day.

975
01:09:02,180 --> 01:09:04,780
Our families will learn the truth. 
We'll be screwed.

976
01:09:05,350 --> 01:09:06,600
So what have you decided?

977
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:09,180
What's there to decide? 
We're going for an abortion.

978
01:09:10,310 --> 01:09:14,390
We need your advice. 
Could it be legally tricky?

979
01:09:14,470 --> 01:09:16,520
No, you're married.

980
01:09:16,890 --> 01:09:21,140
On a doctor's advice, you can have an 
abortion within 20 weeks of pregnancy.

981
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:23,230
If we go for an abortion...

982
01:09:23,310 --> 01:09:26,620
...can that clown Honey sue us?

983
01:09:26,890 --> 01:09:30,020
Technically, yes. 
But he won't win the case.

984
01:09:30,350 --> 01:09:34,350
In pregnancy cases, the mother's rights 
are greater than the father's.

985
01:09:34,430 --> 01:09:37,420
So your decision will be final.

986
01:09:37,740 --> 01:09:41,270
But I suggest you go back 
to that doctor.

987
01:09:41,550 --> 01:09:44,680
He knows your case. 
It'll save you from gossip.

988
01:09:45,010 --> 01:09:46,020
Let's abort.

989
01:09:47,470 --> 01:09:48,180
Let's abort.

990
01:09:55,220 --> 01:09:56,470
Are you OK?

991
01:10:00,310 --> 01:10:01,520
Are we ready?

992
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:06,020
While your husband fills in the form, 
let's get a quick scan done. Come.

993
01:10:17,970 --> 01:10:19,140
Deepti.

994
01:10:21,610 --> 01:10:23,770
See that grey dot on the screen?

995
01:10:25,060 --> 01:10:28,220
That's the baby's heart. 
It's beating.

996
01:10:30,930 --> 01:10:32,470
Why show it to me?

997
01:10:33,140 --> 01:10:35,890
Because I know how desperate 
you are to be a mother.

998
01:10:37,850 --> 01:10:39,440
The final decision is yours.

999
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:43,890
I don't want to influence you, 
specially not in this case.

1000
01:10:44,290 --> 01:10:46,060
It's a very sensitive case.

1001
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:51,930
But I do want you to forget everything 
and think about the heart...

1002
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:54,270
...that's beating inside you.

1003
01:10:55,090 --> 01:10:56,600
The baby's alive and kicking.

1004
01:10:59,030 --> 01:11:01,680
Think of everything you've tried.

1005
01:11:03,720 --> 01:11:06,810
It's a blessing for any woman 
to get pregnant.

1006
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:09,640
But believe me, in your case...

1007
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:11,970
...it's a miracle!

1008
01:11:24,970 --> 01:11:26,100
Deepu.

1009
01:11:27,680 --> 01:11:32,520
Before you decide to keep the baby, 
imagine that baboon's face.

1010
01:11:33,230 --> 01:11:35,770
His IQ is lower than a toddler's.

1011
01:11:36,180 --> 01:11:38,020
And we're having that man's baby!

1012
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:41,520
It's not his baby, it's ours, Varun.

1013
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:43,520
It'll grow up to be just like us.

1014
01:11:44,030 --> 01:11:49,680
Assume 5% of the baby is like him, 
what ditch do we jump into?

1015
01:11:51,430 --> 01:11:55,310
Look, Deepu, I realize you're 
feeling very emotional.

1016
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:59,060
Rest for a few days. Then we'll go 
for an abortion.

1017
01:12:01,350 --> 01:12:02,600
No, Varun.

1018
01:12:03,710 --> 01:12:05,850
There's a life growing inside me.

1019
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:09,220
I saw its heart beating 
with my own eyes.

1020
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:12,350
Do you realize what a terrible thing 
we're doing?

1021
01:12:12,810 --> 01:12:16,770
We're killing a child. 
We can't be murderers.

1022
01:12:19,370 --> 01:12:21,020
Stop being so dramatic!

1023
01:12:31,310 --> 01:12:32,470
Deepu!

1024
01:12:33,390 --> 01:12:34,520
Deepu!

1025
01:12:35,180 --> 01:12:36,930
- It's them. 
- What?

1026
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:39,100
The baby's father.

1027
01:12:40,790 --> 01:12:44,190
Hush! They'll ring the doorbell 
a few times and go.

1028
01:12:44,270 --> 01:12:47,600
- Stop talking like a kid! 
- They're here to talk about a kid.

1029
01:12:48,140 --> 01:12:50,270
"Deepu and Varun's home"

1030
01:12:50,350 --> 01:12:53,060
See that? Snooty show-offs!

1031
01:12:53,140 --> 01:12:55,600
We call our home "paradise." 
They call it "home."

1032
01:12:55,680 --> 01:12:58,560
How obvious can you get!

1033
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,810
Go inside, I'll handle them.

1034
01:13:00,890 --> 01:13:03,520
- Let me see. 
- They're dangerous.

1035
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:04,930
Deepu, please.

1036
01:13:06,340 --> 01:13:08,420
Hello, sister-in-law. How are you?

1037
01:13:09,100 --> 01:13:10,680
All good. Yes?

1038
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:13,310
- We want to talk to you. 
- Go on.

1039
01:13:13,720 --> 01:13:16,970
Out here? Let's talk inside. 
Come, Moni.

1040
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:18,940
- Thank you, sister-in-law. 
- Come in.

1041
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:22,020
Wow! Our home is better than theirs.

1042
01:13:22,690 --> 01:13:27,690
Hey, you! Hello, brother! 
Prefer saying hello the Indian way?

1043
01:13:27,770 --> 01:13:30,970
I knew you were old world 
when I read your doorplate.

1044
01:13:31,100 --> 01:13:32,390
Some delicacies for you.

1045
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:35,970
Bet it's a bomb.

1046
01:13:36,050 --> 01:13:37,310
Varun!

1047
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:39,840
- Excuse me. 
- Can we get a water, please?

1048
01:13:39,970 --> 01:13:40,970
Thank you so much.

1049
01:13:43,310 --> 01:13:45,520
- Here. 
- Straight from the bottle?

1050
01:13:45,850 --> 01:13:49,250
He treats us like family, 
not like guests.

1051
01:13:50,310 --> 01:13:52,060
- What news, brother? 
- Water for you.

1052
01:13:52,680 --> 01:13:54,100
How's work?

1053
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:55,680
What do you want?

1054
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:58,770
You really cut to the chase.

1055
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:03,910
I want to talk about this weird mishap... 
the seed mix-up.

1056
01:14:04,060 --> 01:14:05,890
- Seed? 
- Spam.

1057
01:14:06,430 --> 01:14:09,680
We just want to know 
if my baby is safe.

1058
01:14:09,770 --> 01:14:11,810
Your baby? It's ours.

1059
01:14:11,890 --> 01:14:15,060
- But it's my spam. 
- And she has mine.

1060
01:14:15,140 --> 01:14:17,980
- How so? They're my eggs. 
- My eggs too.

1061
01:14:18,060 --> 01:14:19,270
But the spam's mine!

1062
01:14:19,350 --> 01:14:22,560
Enough of this egg-spam! 
Are you both nuts? What do you want?

1063
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:27,730
I just want the baby inside her, 
with my spam, to be safe.

1064
01:14:27,810 --> 01:14:31,100
In return, I guarantee your spam 
is safe inside my wife.

1065
01:14:31,180 --> 01:14:33,230
Who cares if it's safe or not!

1066
01:14:33,310 --> 01:14:36,120
We want you to stop disturbing us.

1067
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:38,520
Disturb? Please tell him.

1068
01:14:38,660 --> 01:14:42,020
We must know what happens 
once the baby is born.

1069
01:14:42,240 --> 01:14:44,390
You said you didn't want a child 
with my qualities.

1070
01:14:44,810 --> 01:14:48,230
Sir, we want you to give us the baby.

1071
01:14:48,310 --> 01:14:49,680
We'll take care of both children.

1072
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:52,190
Best idea! One minute.

1073
01:14:52,270 --> 01:14:54,140
- What month are we? 
- March.

1074
01:14:54,220 --> 01:14:57,330
9 months means November. 
She'll deliver in November.

1075
01:14:57,970 --> 01:14:59,340
Just shut up!

1076
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:01,560
- I'll talk to you later. 
- It's settled!

1077
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:05,100
And you guys, get up and get lost.

1078
01:15:05,180 --> 01:15:08,220
If you ever talk such rot again... 
just get out!

1079
01:15:08,680 --> 01:15:10,170
Get out? Why?

1080
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:14,850
She's the boss. 
If she can ask me to shut up...

1081
01:15:14,930 --> 01:15:16,720
...why can't she ask you 
to get out?

1082
01:15:16,850 --> 01:15:20,020
So get up and go! Move it!

1083
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:23,600
Crazy people.

1084
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:25,390
Rubbish people!

1085
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:28,720
I'm sure there's a bomb in that box.

1086
01:15:29,970 --> 01:15:32,310
- What was that, Varun? 
- Meaning?

1087
01:15:32,460 --> 01:15:34,810
We're a team. I was showing them 
our teamwork.

1088
01:15:35,180 --> 01:15:38,230
You want me to carry the child for 
9 months, endure pain...

1089
01:15:38,310 --> 01:15:41,720
...deliver the baby 
and then give it to them?

1090
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:44,560
Do you even know how insensitive 
you are?

1091
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:46,770
Insensitive? Me?

1092
01:15:47,020 --> 01:15:48,850
You're the insensitive one.

1093
01:15:49,060 --> 01:15:51,940
Who decided against abortion 
without consulting me?

1094
01:15:52,020 --> 01:15:53,680
Now handle the uncouth twosome.

1095
01:15:53,930 --> 01:15:55,930
They stink of mustard oil.

1096
01:15:56,270 --> 01:16:00,430
From now on I won't let the father 
of your child barge into my home.

1097
01:16:08,680 --> 01:16:09,850
The father of my child?

1098
01:16:10,810 --> 01:16:12,060
Your home?

1099
01:16:12,970 --> 01:16:14,180
I can't believe you, Varun.

1100
01:16:16,110 --> 01:16:18,100
So enjoy your home alone!

1101
01:16:19,020 --> 01:16:22,310
Great, I will. 
Now who's being sensitive?

1102
01:16:23,260 --> 01:16:24,640
Go away!

1103
01:16:25,420 --> 01:16:26,850
I'll be happy alone.

1104
01:16:28,580 --> 01:16:31,020
Love it. Wonderful.

1105
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:33,560
Deepu!

1106
01:16:33,890 --> 01:16:34,680
Deepu!

1107
01:16:36,820 --> 01:16:37,750
Deepu.

1108
01:16:39,210 --> 01:16:40,120
Deepu.

1109
01:16:41,080 --> 01:16:42,080
Varun, let me go.

1110
01:16:42,210 --> 01:16:44,790
- Where you going? 
- Don't know. Let go of the door.

1111
01:16:44,920 --> 01:16:48,000
I'm sorry. It just slipped out. 
I'm really sorry.

1112
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:50,580
No, Varun. It wasn't a mistake.

1113
01:16:50,750 --> 01:16:53,540
You were accusing me of 
having an affair with him.

1114
01:16:53,620 --> 01:16:55,840
That's enough. 
You don't want to be a parent.

1115
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:59,540
- Clearly I'm forcing you. Let it be! 
- Not true.

1116
01:16:59,620 --> 01:17:02,710
Listen to me. Relax. 
Just cool down.

1117
01:17:32,330 --> 01:17:33,290
What's this?

1118
01:17:33,620 --> 01:17:34,250
Pardon me?

1119
01:17:34,460 --> 01:17:36,460
- What's going on? 
- What does it look like?

1120
01:17:36,750 --> 01:17:39,530
We're renting the flat above you.

1121
01:17:41,460 --> 01:17:43,870
Bunty! Unload all our things.

1122
01:17:44,580 --> 01:17:45,710
Come, Moni.

1123
01:18:06,070 --> 01:18:07,600
Slow it down!

1124
01:18:16,120 --> 01:18:17,170
Sister-in-law.

1125
01:18:18,670 --> 01:18:20,960
Good morning. 
Off to work?

1126
01:18:21,670 --> 01:18:23,870
Have a "Good Day" or a "Krackjack."

1127
01:18:25,170 --> 01:18:26,870
Both super biscuits!

1128
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:39,330
But the boy's too stubborn

1129
01:18:40,380 --> 01:18:43,070
He won't cut me any slack

1130
01:18:47,620 --> 01:18:50,720
Be friends with me

1131
01:18:54,540 --> 01:18:57,370
Give your heart in return of mine

1132
01:18:59,790 --> 01:19:01,650
What a trade-off!

1133
01:19:06,420 --> 01:19:09,020
A golden deal

1134
01:19:40,540 --> 01:19:41,920
Oh my God!

1135
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:44,700
Richa, I don't trust that Honey one bit.

1136
01:19:44,920 --> 01:19:47,290
He's a pest. 
We must do something.

1137
01:19:47,530 --> 01:19:48,790
Like what?

1138
01:19:49,080 --> 01:19:51,380
Legally we can't stop them 
from living in your building.

1139
01:19:51,560 --> 01:19:53,710
But we can stop them from 
claiming rights to the child.

1140
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,460
Why don't we make a contract?

1141
01:19:55,660 --> 01:19:57,870
It'll say post-delivery...

1142
01:19:58,080 --> 01:20:01,540
...they'll have no rights to our child, 
nor will we to theirs.

1143
01:20:01,790 --> 01:20:03,350
No contact either...

1144
01:20:03,630 --> 01:20:05,670
...regardless of whose spam is involved.

1145
01:20:06,500 --> 01:20:08,870
I'll check the legalities 
and get back to you.

1146
01:20:09,080 --> 01:20:10,790
- I need a little time. 
- Bye.

1147
01:20:11,180 --> 01:20:14,420
You like the deal. But I don't

1148
01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:16,950
This love trade-off

1149
01:20:21,210 --> 01:20:22,790
Don't get too comfy

1150
01:20:22,870 --> 01:20:24,500
Move aside

1151
01:20:24,580 --> 01:20:26,890
Don't spoil my mood

1152
01:20:29,210 --> 01:20:31,440
When you touched my heart

1153
01:20:32,750 --> 01:20:35,060
This Jatt became all sentimental

1154
01:20:39,580 --> 01:20:42,870
Be friends with me

1155
01:20:46,710 --> 01:20:49,420
Give your heart in return of mine

1156
01:20:51,960 --> 01:20:54,030
What a trade-off!

1157
01:21:01,750 --> 01:21:05,210
You must rest. Take time off. 
To hell with work!

1158
01:21:05,290 --> 01:21:06,710
You're in your third month.

1159
01:21:07,960 --> 01:21:09,710
Have a safe lift, sister-in-law.

1160
01:21:11,510 --> 01:21:12,870
These ladies...!

1161
01:21:13,370 --> 01:21:16,610
A golden deal

1162
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:23,620
Sister-in-law.

1163
01:21:56,210 --> 01:21:58,960
Hi! The contract's here.

1164
01:22:15,670 --> 01:22:17,010
I think we should call them.

1165
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:48,130
Varun!

1166
01:22:48,550 --> 01:22:50,080
Varun, open the door!

1167
01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:54,670
Work in progress.

1168
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:03,080
That's good.

1169
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:06,500
Forgot to flush?

1170
01:23:06,750 --> 01:23:09,460
I'm so stressed, nothing happened. 
Is that OK by you?

1171
01:23:09,660 --> 01:23:12,210
I knew you smoked but now 
you're smoking a ***?

1172
01:23:12,290 --> 01:23:16,170
Yes, Miss Sherlock Holmes. 
OK. I smoked a ***.

1173
01:23:16,250 --> 01:23:19,080
- It's your fault. 
- My fault?

1174
01:23:19,160 --> 01:23:22,420
It's your fault they barged 
into our lives.

1175
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:25,840
If you had taken my advice 
and had an abortion...

1176
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:28,460
- ...we wouldn't have to see this day. 
- Relax.

1177
01:23:28,790 --> 01:23:34,200
We need them to sign the contract. 
Then we can go our separate ways.

1178
01:23:35,560 --> 01:23:37,480
Sh**! They're here.

1179
01:23:37,560 --> 01:23:40,370
- Relax, Varun. It's fine. 
- Relax?

1180
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:42,790
It'll be all over today.

1181
01:23:43,330 --> 01:23:44,790
We've got this.

1182
01:23:46,540 --> 01:23:47,960
Teamwork?

1183
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:50,250
Teamwork!

1184
01:23:52,040 --> 01:23:55,370
- Will you get the door? 
- Sure! I'm the man of the house.

1185
01:23:59,330 --> 01:24:00,750
Hello, brother. How are you?

1186
01:24:00,830 --> 01:24:02,330
Very well. Come in.

1187
01:24:04,920 --> 01:24:07,670
- Should I take my shoes off? 
- No need. Barge in.

1188
01:24:07,750 --> 01:24:08,880
We'll take our shoes off.

1189
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:11,790
The less bacteria entering the house 
the better. Think of the babies!

1190
01:24:12,610 --> 01:24:14,960
Can't stop all the bacteria.

1191
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:18,370
Pulling my leg! 
Wanna try the other leg?

1192
01:24:18,450 --> 01:24:20,040
Brother, I must thank you.

1193
01:24:20,170 --> 01:24:22,830
I know it's for the contract, but 
at least you invited us home.

1194
01:24:22,910 --> 01:24:25,430
- Thank you. 
- Sit down.

1195
01:24:25,710 --> 01:24:27,750
Come, Moni. Thank you, sir.

1196
01:24:28,500 --> 01:24:30,170
He's in a good mood.

1197
01:24:32,170 --> 01:24:33,740
Easy.

1198
01:24:37,160 --> 01:24:39,750
Listen. Ask where the toilet is.

1199
01:24:39,890 --> 01:24:43,040
But you just went. How many times 
in a day do you go?

1200
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:45,340
I'll make you a portable toilet.

1201
01:24:45,420 --> 01:24:46,920
A kind of takeaway.

1202
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:48,670
I can't control it.

1203
01:24:48,750 --> 01:24:51,210
- Ask! 
- Be patient. Let them come back.

1204
01:24:51,290 --> 01:24:52,920
Who can I ask? The walls?

1205
01:24:53,670 --> 01:24:58,500
His laugh makes my whole body 
shake with disgust.

1206
01:24:59,740 --> 01:25:01,790
I'm dying to punch him.

1207
01:25:03,170 --> 01:25:04,000
Relax!

1208
01:25:05,990 --> 01:25:07,250
Namaste.

1209
01:25:07,670 --> 01:25:10,040
Tea? Coffee? Juice?

1210
01:25:10,340 --> 01:25:11,490
Nothing, thank you.

1211
01:25:11,570 --> 01:25:13,000
Can I get a beer, please?

1212
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:22,290
Varun.

1213
01:25:27,370 --> 01:25:28,710
Coming up.

1214
01:25:34,790 --> 01:25:37,790
Beer is basically barley water.

1215
01:25:37,870 --> 01:25:39,920
Rewires your gut.

1216
01:25:42,580 --> 01:25:43,670
Hear that?

1217
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:47,380
Good shot, sister-in-law.

1218
01:25:47,460 --> 01:25:48,920
Isn't she cute?

1219
01:25:49,500 --> 01:25:51,170
My wife breaks wind.

1220
01:25:51,250 --> 01:25:55,250
In pregnancy, the belly's like 
a soda spraying gas bubbles.

1221
01:25:55,330 --> 01:25:57,810
I'm sure you fart too.

1222
01:26:03,790 --> 01:26:04,640
Varun!

1223
01:26:05,980 --> 01:26:07,460
The toilet, please?

1224
01:26:07,540 --> 01:26:09,120
Good idea.

1225
01:26:09,910 --> 01:26:10,750
Hello?

1226
01:26:10,830 --> 01:26:13,710
- Come. 
- Easy does it!

1227
01:26:15,530 --> 01:26:17,670
Careful. You might fart again.

1228
01:26:23,490 --> 01:26:25,080
Varun's in a good mood today.

1229
01:26:25,160 --> 01:26:26,420
Come, Mrs Batra.

1230
01:26:26,990 --> 01:26:29,870
The toilet. 
The light switch is to your left.

1231
01:26:31,830 --> 01:26:35,250
If you need anything, call.

1232
01:26:52,070 --> 01:26:54,920
I forgot! Sister-in-law, 
some laddoos.

1233
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:56,210
My mother made them.

1234
01:26:56,370 --> 01:26:59,370
- Does your Mummy know? 
- No. She made them for Moni.

1235
01:26:59,540 --> 01:27:01,620
I thought I'd give you some.

1236
01:27:03,500 --> 01:27:04,710
Put them down.

1237
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:16,290
All well?

1238
01:27:17,820 --> 01:27:20,670
Could you call my husband, please?

1239
01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:25,290
OK.

1240
01:27:28,120 --> 01:27:30,790
- Never mind. 
- What is it?

1241
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,320
Your 'flesh' isn't working.

1242
01:27:35,960 --> 01:27:39,260
It's not like our 'flesh.'

1243
01:27:43,170 --> 01:27:45,160
What's so funny?

1244
01:27:47,880 --> 01:27:49,370
'Flesh!'

1245
01:27:51,870 --> 01:27:53,120
Sorry.

1246
01:27:53,650 --> 01:27:55,620
You have a nice library.

1247
01:27:58,370 --> 01:28:02,920
If you prefer Hindi books, 
they're over there.

1248
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,420
No, I read English novels too.

1249
01:28:06,040 --> 01:28:09,020
I did my English Horrors 
at Guru Nanak Dev University.

1250
01:28:13,140 --> 01:28:18,850
If you'd like to have one of my books, 
it will be my 'horror.'

1251
01:28:23,070 --> 01:28:26,860
- Sister-in-law, are you OK? 
- Yes.

1252
01:28:27,070 --> 01:28:30,960
You have strong arms. 
My child will have them too.

1253
01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:33,430
- Varun! 
- The police are here.

1254
01:28:33,710 --> 01:28:35,160
He was just helping me.

1255
01:28:36,250 --> 01:28:38,170
So helpful, isn't he?

1256
01:28:38,590 --> 01:28:40,120
Can I borrow this book?

1257
01:28:40,250 --> 01:28:41,820
"Sweaty Nights."

1258
01:28:45,080 --> 01:28:48,790
Forget it. 
Actually, I've already read it.

1259
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:51,580
- I'll be off. 
- "Sweaty Nights!"

1260
01:28:53,620 --> 01:28:56,710
That clown was trying to feed me 
homemade laddoos...

1261
01:28:56,790 --> 01:28:59,290
...and you're smoking a *** 
and flirting with his wife.

1262
01:28:59,370 --> 01:29:03,040
I wasn't flirting. 
But I can't stop laughing.

1263
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:05,790
She's so darn funny.

1264
01:29:05,870 --> 01:29:09,280
Varun, I don't want us to kill 
each other in front of them.

1265
01:29:09,420 --> 01:29:12,250
So let's get it over with. 
Where's the contract?

1266
01:29:14,760 --> 01:29:17,710
Above "Sweaty Nights."

1267
01:29:21,750 --> 01:29:23,420
And listen...

1268
01:29:23,500 --> 01:29:25,670
Don't talk in front of them.

1269
01:29:27,750 --> 01:29:29,120
Ridiculous.

1270
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:45,330
Doesn't he look weird today?

1271
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:52,610
Here's the contract. 
Varun mentioned it.

1272
01:29:52,750 --> 01:29:54,620
Yes. That's why we're here.

1273
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,210
When your husband told me 
about it...

1274
01:29:57,290 --> 01:29:59,580
...I asked my lawyer to 
make us a contract too.

1275
01:30:00,020 --> 01:30:02,920
We read yours, you read ours.

1276
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:04,330
Moni, give them.

1277
01:30:04,890 --> 01:30:06,230
Here you go.

1278
01:30:07,340 --> 01:30:08,500
Moni will read it.

1279
01:30:08,790 --> 01:30:11,850
Moni's done her 'Horrors' in English.

1280
01:30:13,980 --> 01:30:16,890
- Good. Good. Good. 
- Thank you.

1281
01:30:39,750 --> 01:30:41,210
What's this nonsense?

1282
01:30:41,450 --> 01:30:45,170
That many English words can only mean 
the contract's dodgy.

1283
01:30:45,320 --> 01:30:47,000
Should've written it in French.

1284
01:30:47,080 --> 01:30:49,990
No, sister-in-law. We can't sign 
something we don't understand.

1285
01:30:50,070 --> 01:30:51,830
Shut up! What's this?

1286
01:30:52,040 --> 01:30:55,800
If it's a girl or boy, it'll go to 
a convent school and college in Canada.

1287
01:30:56,160 --> 01:30:59,340
When it grows up, 
it'll be an athlete or rapper.

1288
01:30:59,420 --> 01:31:00,170
So?

1289
01:31:00,250 --> 01:31:03,040
His father is sprinter 
Milkha Singh's fan.

1290
01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:04,460
We're rapper Honey Singh's fans!

1291
01:31:06,360 --> 01:31:08,580
Is this a prank or a contract?

1292
01:31:08,660 --> 01:31:10,130
A prank?

1293
01:31:10,210 --> 01:31:13,520
Just because we're a cute couple, 
you're accusing us of the worst.

1294
01:31:14,790 --> 01:31:17,170
Varun, will you say something?

1295
01:31:18,370 --> 01:31:22,350
I was wondering about 
that kid's future.

1296
01:31:22,430 --> 01:31:25,040
Don't worry. 
Our minds are made up.

1297
01:31:25,120 --> 01:31:27,340
- Tell them! 
- Athlete or rapper.

1298
01:31:29,290 --> 01:31:30,420
Shut up, guys!

1299
01:31:30,900 --> 01:31:32,760
You want to know 
what's in this contract?

1300
01:31:34,330 --> 01:31:38,000
Our contract says you will not 
come anywhere near our child.

1301
01:31:38,170 --> 01:31:39,750
No more contact with us.

1302
01:31:39,880 --> 01:31:43,790
We'll have no rights on your child, 
nor will you have on ours.

1303
01:31:47,750 --> 01:31:49,120
Take the pen.

1304
01:31:51,540 --> 01:31:53,440
Here's a pen. Sign it.

1305
01:31:53,910 --> 01:31:58,670
We wanted to be friends with you, 
but you want nothing to do with us.

1306
01:31:58,750 --> 01:32:00,650
- Just sign it now. 
- Moni...

1307
01:32:04,620 --> 01:32:06,500
Wait, let me show them.

1308
01:32:07,140 --> 01:32:08,870
The pen's covered in earwax.

1309
01:32:12,270 --> 01:32:14,250
Here's my angry signature.

1310
01:32:15,180 --> 01:32:17,370
If you don't care about your child...

1311
01:32:17,450 --> 01:32:20,370
...it doesn't mean we don't care 
about ours.

1312
01:32:20,790 --> 01:32:22,930
Get out!

1313
01:32:24,840 --> 01:32:25,750
Varun!

1314
01:32:27,750 --> 01:32:29,870
- Get out! 
- You get out, my friend.

1315
01:32:30,480 --> 01:32:32,730
- This is our house. 
- Then get in!

1316
01:32:35,060 --> 01:32:39,310
All they can say is "Get out!" 
We're not coming back.

1317
01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:42,750
I don't get this guy.

1318
01:32:42,830 --> 01:32:45,880
Sister-in-law, how about a selfie? 
My 'flush' is on.

1319
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:48,040
- I'll selfie you. 
- My 'flush' is on.

1320
01:32:48,120 --> 01:32:50,750
- Varun, just stop it! 
- Sister-in-law...

1321
01:32:54,180 --> 01:32:56,340
I read their contract last night.

1322
01:32:57,070 --> 01:32:59,800
It tells us how to raise the kid.

1323
01:32:59,880 --> 01:33:02,760
It even says that until he's 16...

1324
01:33:02,840 --> 01:33:06,930
...we must feed him clarified butter 
to make his bones strong.

1325
01:33:07,010 --> 01:33:08,680
What a character, man!

1326
01:33:08,760 --> 01:33:11,680
You really chose a weirdo 
for the sperm swap.

1327
01:33:11,930 --> 01:33:15,140
I keep seeing the Sardar's face 
in my dreams.

1328
01:33:15,580 --> 01:33:18,390
Who's that Sardar behind you?

1329
01:33:18,580 --> 01:33:20,510
- Not funny. 
- Just look!

1330
01:33:21,360 --> 01:33:22,840
Sir, the meeting...

1331
01:33:25,580 --> 01:33:28,640
I'm coming. 
Tell them I'm watching 'Kesari'.

1332
01:33:32,790 --> 01:33:34,340
What's Honey's problem?

1333
01:33:34,850 --> 01:33:35,970
What does he want from us?

1334
01:33:36,460 --> 01:33:39,550
Not from you. He wants the kid 
growing inside your wife.

1335
01:33:39,770 --> 01:33:42,630
You know, blood is thicker 
than water.

1336
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:44,090
Shut up!

1337
01:33:44,240 --> 01:33:47,090
Don't tell me you don't 
feel emotional when...

1338
01:33:47,170 --> 01:33:49,970
...you see Monika's bump. 
That's your child.

1339
01:33:50,710 --> 01:33:51,870
Your biological child.

1340
01:33:53,930 --> 01:33:55,280
No. I don't.

1341
01:33:58,420 --> 01:34:01,670
I have a meeting. 
Talk to you guys later. Bye.

1342
01:34:10,250 --> 01:34:11,870
I'm seven months pregnant...

1343
01:34:12,370 --> 01:34:14,580
...but there's been 
no movement, doctor.

1344
01:34:14,920 --> 01:34:17,620
The baby should've kicked by now.

1345
01:34:18,260 --> 01:34:22,040
Maybe it has. 
But you were too busy to feel it.

1346
01:34:22,120 --> 01:34:23,870
What are you saying, doctor?

1347
01:34:24,520 --> 01:34:26,540
The baby is all I think about.

1348
01:34:26,920 --> 01:34:30,500
When I'm at work, I think 
about it all the time.

1349
01:34:31,330 --> 01:34:32,960
I won't miss it for anything at all.

1350
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:35,210
I'm glad.

1351
01:34:35,500 --> 01:34:40,640
Good you're busy and not 
stressed out like other moms.

1352
01:34:45,480 --> 01:34:46,830
Actually...

1353
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:51,290
...may I see the file of the baby's 
biological father?

1354
01:34:52,130 --> 01:34:53,790
His medical history.

1355
01:34:57,640 --> 01:34:59,670
I'm sorry, Deepti, that's confidential.

1356
01:35:01,910 --> 01:35:04,250
Relax! Your child's perfectly healthy.

1357
01:35:04,330 --> 01:35:06,790
If there was a problem, 
I would've told you.

1358
01:35:07,170 --> 01:35:10,250
It's just that I don't know 
anything about those people.

1359
01:35:11,240 --> 01:35:12,960
It scares me.

1360
01:35:13,210 --> 01:35:15,000
So get to know them.

1361
01:35:18,120 --> 01:35:22,710
If you made this journey together, 
It would be easier on everyone.

1362
01:35:26,120 --> 01:35:28,420
You're not the only one 
who's scared.

1363
01:35:29,120 --> 01:35:30,800
Monika's scared too.

1364
01:35:31,120 --> 01:35:32,290
Really?

1365
01:35:33,110 --> 01:35:35,740
She looks so relaxed like 
she was pregnant every year.

1366
01:35:39,420 --> 01:35:41,500
Hello, aunty. How are you?

1367
01:35:43,210 --> 01:35:46,330
Are you at a kitty party?

1368
01:35:47,170 --> 01:35:50,550
No problem. I just called.

1369
01:35:51,830 --> 01:35:54,670
We'll come to see you 
with your grandchild.

1370
01:35:54,830 --> 01:35:57,500
OK. Bye.

1371
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:18,460
Sister-in-law?

1372
01:36:19,720 --> 01:36:22,660
- Come in, sister-in-law. 
- Want some street food?

1373
01:36:23,690 --> 01:36:24,830
Street food?

1374
01:36:31,620 --> 01:36:32,780
What's wrong?

1375
01:36:33,210 --> 01:36:34,960
- It reminds me of... 
- What?

1376
01:36:36,960 --> 01:36:38,500
Chandigarh street food.

1377
01:36:46,370 --> 01:36:47,090
Yes, madam?

1378
01:36:47,170 --> 01:36:49,540
Two sour, two sweet. 
Two mixed 'gol gappe.'

1379
01:36:49,620 --> 01:36:51,680
You have dry ones too?

1380
01:37:04,090 --> 01:37:05,940
How long have you tried 
for a child?

1381
01:37:06,640 --> 01:37:08,720
- Six years. 
- Are you serious?

1382
01:37:09,960 --> 01:37:11,920
I was pregnant twice.

1383
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:14,310
But I had two miscarriages.

1384
01:37:17,220 --> 01:37:18,710
And you kept trying?

1385
01:37:20,180 --> 01:37:22,620
Are children more important 
than your health?

1386
01:37:24,240 --> 01:37:25,540
Why didn't you adopt?

1387
01:37:27,960 --> 01:37:30,270
Blood's thicker than water.

1388
01:37:59,370 --> 01:38:00,620
Hello, brother!

1389
01:38:02,120 --> 01:38:03,670
Sorry, I'm a little late.

1390
01:38:03,750 --> 01:38:07,100
Mumbai traffic! Cars now double up 
as second homes.

1391
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:09,740
Why call me here?

1392
01:38:10,330 --> 01:38:11,920
Leaving everything aside...

1393
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:13,750
I want to thank you for coming.

1394
01:38:16,620 --> 01:38:18,710
We moved here seven months ago...

1395
01:38:18,790 --> 01:38:21,000
...but we've never talked, 
man-to-man.

1396
01:38:21,120 --> 01:38:23,290
So meeting here is good.

1397
01:38:23,370 --> 01:38:26,340
Because it's 'get out' 
when we visit you!

1398
01:38:28,120 --> 01:38:30,350
You know all that.

1399
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:34,000
What's happened to us is beyond belief. 
No doubt.

1400
01:38:34,080 --> 01:38:37,870
But I'm glad my spam swam 
into good people.

1401
01:38:40,290 --> 01:38:44,040
My spam was running 
in the wrong race but it won.

1402
01:38:45,290 --> 01:38:48,170
So what will you drink? Sonny!

1403
01:38:49,370 --> 01:38:51,960
Two large whiskeys. 
Soda or water?

1404
01:38:52,210 --> 01:38:53,250
It's only 6:30.

1405
01:38:53,330 --> 01:38:55,550
That's why I ask. Soda or water? 
Otherwise it's neat, no?

1406
01:38:57,370 --> 01:39:00,490
Get me a strawberry Daiquiri, 
a virgin.

1407
01:39:00,830 --> 01:39:01,870
A what Daiquiri?

1408
01:39:03,870 --> 01:39:05,380
- Never mind. 
- Alright.

1409
01:39:07,330 --> 01:39:10,880
I can't say cheers with a Daiquiri.

1410
01:39:10,960 --> 01:39:13,380
No way. Just look at the color.

1411
01:39:13,460 --> 01:39:15,950
- Have a proper drink. 
- No.

1412
01:39:16,170 --> 01:39:18,350
- Don't say no. 
- No, no.

1413
01:39:18,500 --> 01:39:20,330
Please, my brother.

1414
01:39:21,620 --> 01:39:22,880
A small one.

1415
01:39:22,960 --> 01:39:25,800
We won't get sozzled. 
Same for him.

1416
01:39:28,730 --> 01:39:29,620
Brother...

1417
01:39:30,920 --> 01:39:31,950
Cheers!

1418
01:39:37,750 --> 01:39:39,520
Is your husband attached 
to the child?

1419
01:39:42,280 --> 01:39:43,370
I don't know.

1420
01:39:44,840 --> 01:39:45,810
And Honey?

1421
01:39:46,750 --> 01:39:50,870
He's attached, but he's 
more concerned about you.

1422
01:39:55,080 --> 01:39:56,510
Don't you feel bad?

1423
01:39:58,920 --> 01:40:00,420
I do.

1424
01:40:11,430 --> 01:40:13,180
- Oh no. 
- What's wrong?

1425
01:40:13,960 --> 01:40:17,800
The baby kicked again. 
It's getting naughty.

1426
01:40:27,370 --> 01:40:30,150
Come on, brother. Please.

1427
01:40:32,750 --> 01:40:37,310
You're the talk of the town, 
my Chandigarh boy!

1428
01:40:39,460 --> 01:40:44,190
The cop at the crossroads sighs 
when he sees you

1429
01:40:46,330 --> 01:40:48,960
You with the mole on your chin

1430
01:40:51,040 --> 01:40:53,000
It's like the spot on the moon

1431
01:40:53,080 --> 01:40:54,960
Those black shades of yours

1432
01:40:57,620 --> 01:41:00,000
Boy, do they look cool on you!

1433
01:41:00,120 --> 01:41:02,210
They stand out on your fair skin

1434
01:41:12,830 --> 01:41:15,130
- Brother, one kiss! 
- No, no.

1435
01:41:17,080 --> 01:41:19,850
- Brother, one kiss. 
- Are you nuts?

1436
01:41:20,580 --> 01:41:23,620
All the tension has gone now!

1437
01:41:25,790 --> 01:41:27,120
Can I say something?

1438
01:41:27,500 --> 01:41:29,130
That doctor...

1439
01:41:29,780 --> 01:41:33,210
Joshi is not a doctor, 
he's just shifty.

1440
01:41:33,420 --> 01:41:34,710
Yes, shifty.

1441
01:41:35,080 --> 01:41:42,830
He said, "Mr Batra, we'll take the eggs, 
the sperm, no, spam...

1442
01:41:42,910 --> 01:41:46,710
"...you sit at home and your baby 
will be born in our lab."

1443
01:41:46,790 --> 01:41:49,000
I was blown away.

1444
01:41:49,290 --> 01:41:51,080
The miracles of modern science!

1445
01:41:51,290 --> 01:41:53,710
The parents lazing at home...

1446
01:41:53,790 --> 01:41:57,000
...and this character's 
creating lab babies.

1447
01:41:57,080 --> 01:41:58,620
95% success.

1448
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:02,540
I've learned words 
I never thought existed.

1449
01:42:02,670 --> 01:42:06,300
Like 'ovary.' 
It reminds me of that song...

1450
01:42:06,750 --> 01:42:11,640
Ovary! Dancing wildly in the garden 
at midnight

1451
01:42:17,540 --> 01:42:21,670
By the way, it's not 'ovary!' 
It's 'morni,' a peahen.

1452
01:42:21,750 --> 01:42:23,830
Ovary sounds better.

1453
01:42:25,580 --> 01:42:27,040
By the way, tell me...

1454
01:42:27,830 --> 01:42:33,720
Has my...I mean, your kid 
started kicking?

1455
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,210
I have no idea.

1456
01:42:38,750 --> 01:42:44,080
You people are great, but 
something's bothering me.

1457
01:42:44,750 --> 01:42:48,060
Don't mind, brother. 
God has done what He had to.

1458
01:42:48,540 --> 01:42:54,320
But what worries me is your negligence 
might harm my child.

1459
01:42:59,540 --> 01:43:02,040
- Excuse me? 
- Nothing to excuse you about.

1460
01:43:02,120 --> 01:43:05,370
Sister-in-law is seven months 
pregnant and she's still working.

1461
01:43:05,500 --> 01:43:07,790
She won't stop. You can't take 
the money with you.

1462
01:43:09,670 --> 01:43:11,080
It's her decision.

1463
01:43:12,960 --> 01:43:14,870
- Don't get personal. 
- Personal?

1464
01:43:15,170 --> 01:43:18,710
My spam is inside your wife, 
your spam is inside Moni.

1465
01:43:18,790 --> 01:43:20,120
What's more personal?

1466
01:43:23,830 --> 01:43:25,170
What's this nonsense?

1467
01:43:26,700 --> 01:43:28,580
You called me here for this?

1468
01:43:28,830 --> 01:43:30,080
Brother...

1469
01:43:32,040 --> 01:43:33,580
I wouldn't lie to you.

1470
01:43:33,920 --> 01:43:36,580
I called you here 'cos 
I'm worried about my baby.

1471
01:43:36,870 --> 01:43:39,670
What with your wife working, 
if anything happens to my kid...

1472
01:43:39,900 --> 01:43:41,210
...I'll teach you a lesson.

1473
01:43:41,290 --> 01:43:44,090
Who are you to teach me 
a lesson?

1474
01:43:44,170 --> 01:43:47,290
I've put with your clowning, 
but don't talk rubbish.

1475
01:43:47,370 --> 01:43:48,330
Sir, please.

1476
01:43:48,620 --> 01:43:51,500
- We have other customers. 
- To hell with the customers!

1477
01:43:51,580 --> 01:43:53,840
I haven't started yet.

1478
01:43:53,920 --> 01:43:57,770
You don't even know if your child 
has kicked.

1479
01:43:57,920 --> 01:44:01,540
And you want me to sign a contract 
giving you my child...

1480
01:44:01,620 --> 01:44:02,960
...and never meet the baby.

1481
01:44:03,040 --> 01:44:08,440
If my spam ends up with reckless people, 
wouldn't it worry me?

1482
01:44:08,750 --> 01:44:10,500
I shouldn't have come here.

1483
01:44:10,960 --> 01:44:15,730
I'm disgusted at the thought 
the kid will look like you.

1484
01:44:16,710 --> 01:44:17,790
Hear that?

1485
01:44:17,870 --> 01:44:20,340
His kid will look like me!

1486
01:44:20,420 --> 01:44:22,630
Why are you laughing?

1487
01:44:22,710 --> 01:44:25,980
Your child will look like me!

1488
01:44:26,620 --> 01:44:28,760
- So? 
- So what?

1489
01:44:29,710 --> 01:44:32,750
Sir! You're disturbing the 
other customers.

1490
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:34,920
Please leave or I'll call the police.

1491
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,710
I'm the real Batra, I don't budge.

1492
01:44:37,790 --> 01:44:41,250
And this Batra won't go 
till he's finished his drink.

1493
01:44:43,960 --> 01:44:46,500
That's the real Batra for you. 
Call the cops if you want.

1494
01:44:46,580 --> 01:44:47,590
Useless!

1495
01:44:47,670 --> 01:44:51,870
You English-talking smartass! 
Get out!

1496
01:44:52,330 --> 01:44:54,600
He loves saying "Get out."

1497
01:44:55,330 --> 01:44:56,870
Bring me my peg.

1498
01:44:59,420 --> 01:45:02,290
- What you staring at? 
- Hello, police?

1499
01:45:14,370 --> 01:45:16,920
- Baby, are you OK? 
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1500
01:45:22,040 --> 01:45:23,210
I saw Monika today.

1501
01:45:25,870 --> 01:45:27,960
Her child has started kicking.

1502
01:45:28,350 --> 01:45:30,920
But ours hasn't.

1503
01:45:32,290 --> 01:45:34,090
Dr Joshi said everything was fine.

1504
01:45:34,330 --> 01:45:37,130
It's the seventh month. It should've 
kicked by now.

1505
01:45:37,750 --> 01:45:39,670
Kick. Kick. Kick!

1506
01:45:39,750 --> 01:45:42,790
My sperm was mixed up with 
Honey's sperm, not Ronaldo's.

1507
01:45:43,170 --> 01:45:46,420
That's all you can talk about.

1508
01:45:47,440 --> 01:45:52,040
Can't breathe in peace without 
hearing about those clowns.

1509
01:45:53,040 --> 01:45:54,330
I'm exhausted.

1510
01:46:25,460 --> 01:46:26,620
I'm sorry.

1511
01:46:29,080 --> 01:46:30,120
It's OK.

1512
01:46:32,710 --> 01:46:34,620
Mom and Dad are coming next week.

1513
01:46:36,240 --> 01:46:38,080
They wanted to give you a surprise.

1514
01:46:39,670 --> 01:46:41,250
They sounded so excited.

1515
01:46:42,790 --> 01:46:44,580
I didn't know how to stop them.

1516
01:46:46,420 --> 01:46:47,870
You don't need to.

1517
01:46:48,250 --> 01:46:50,580
They're your parents after all. 
Of course they'd be excited.

1518
01:46:53,580 --> 01:46:56,170
Don't behave like everything's normal.

1519
01:46:57,500 --> 01:46:59,750
Everything could be normal, Varun.

1520
01:47:00,790 --> 01:47:03,550
Don't you feel attached to this child?

1521
01:47:03,710 --> 01:47:05,000
No, I don't.

1522
01:47:05,210 --> 01:47:07,740
I don't. So hang me.

1523
01:47:09,170 --> 01:47:11,290
You'll be carrying it for nine months.

1524
01:47:11,370 --> 01:47:15,620
Naturally you'll feel attached. 
I get it. But I don't feel it.

1525
01:47:19,020 --> 01:47:23,000
Let those clowns have the baby. 
Makes no difference to me.

1526
01:47:33,910 --> 01:47:37,460
You've said that before, 
but you're right.

1527
01:47:39,340 --> 01:47:43,170
It wouldn't affect you if I gave them 
the baby.

1528
01:47:44,150 --> 01:47:48,120
Getting pregnant, carrying a baby? 
No big deal.

1529
01:47:49,080 --> 01:47:50,960
One has to endure a little pain.

1530
01:47:51,040 --> 01:47:55,920
Minor problems. Falling hair, facial boils, 
body rash, endless injections.

1531
01:47:56,670 --> 01:48:01,130
Your bladder can't hold your pee 
because of the baby's weight.

1532
01:48:01,210 --> 01:48:02,710
Fever, cold, cough.

1533
01:48:02,960 --> 01:48:06,090
And under no circumstance take 
any medicine. It'll harm the baby.

1534
01:48:06,170 --> 01:48:08,870
That's no big deal either.

1535
01:48:09,870 --> 01:48:12,340
Can't wear your favorite clothes, 
nothing fits.

1536
01:48:12,420 --> 01:48:14,710
Can't eat your favorite food, 
not allowed.

1537
01:48:14,790 --> 01:48:17,840
Depression, mood swings. 
We endure it all...

1538
01:48:17,920 --> 01:48:20,040
...so no one gets upset.

1539
01:48:21,500 --> 01:48:25,000
A mother sacrifices her body 
for those nine months.

1540
01:48:26,580 --> 01:48:31,670
And you can't even imagine 
the labor pain.

1541
01:48:33,330 --> 01:48:35,960
But we take it all with a smile.

1542
01:48:39,670 --> 01:48:40,960
Because we know...

1543
01:48:42,830 --> 01:48:45,170
...when we see the baby 
for the first time...

1544
01:48:47,580 --> 01:48:49,670
...it'll all be worth it.

1545
01:48:50,120 --> 01:48:54,040
But a man's contribution 
during pregnancy?

1546
01:48:54,460 --> 01:48:56,770
A cool "Ah, baby, I've come."

1547
01:48:59,280 --> 01:49:02,120
I'm sure none of this ever 
crossed your mind.

1548
01:49:04,210 --> 01:49:06,370
Because you were never 
on the same page, Varun.

1549
01:49:07,830 --> 01:49:12,920
You were busy thinking about 
how to get them off your back.

1550
01:49:20,210 --> 01:49:21,870
You call this good news, Varun?

1551
01:49:22,620 --> 01:49:27,460
Since we heard the news, 
there's been nothing good between us.

1552
01:49:57,510 --> 01:50:00,760
Take me to the hospital. 
He isn't at home.

1553
01:50:01,300 --> 01:50:02,670
His phone is switched off.

1554
01:50:03,170 --> 01:50:04,540
I'm dying.

1555
01:50:05,500 --> 01:50:06,410
Deepu!

1556
01:50:06,840 --> 01:50:07,770
Deepu!

1557
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,420
O Mother Goddess, help me...

1558
01:50:13,500 --> 01:50:15,330
Varun, hurry up.

1559
01:50:19,840 --> 01:50:20,920
What happened?

1560
01:50:21,460 --> 01:50:22,510
A kick!

1561
01:50:22,590 --> 01:50:24,880
Careful, sister-in-law. 
Deepu's pregnant too.

1562
01:50:25,250 --> 01:50:27,030
Our baby kicked.

1563
01:50:27,380 --> 01:50:28,420
Oh...OK.

1564
01:50:28,500 --> 01:50:29,880
Congratulations, sister-in-law.

1565
01:50:30,940 --> 01:50:34,070
- Brother, please be quick. 
- Varun, hurry up.

1566
01:50:42,590 --> 01:50:45,720
- She's gone into labor. 
- It's only her seventh month, doctor.

1567
01:50:46,500 --> 01:50:48,030
The baby's premature.

1568
01:50:48,250 --> 01:50:50,670
She has a history of miscarriages.

1569
01:50:50,920 --> 01:50:54,510
Anyway, complete the formalities. 
Try and contact her husband.

1570
01:50:54,590 --> 01:50:56,590
I have. He isn't answering.

1571
01:50:57,170 --> 01:50:58,670
Has the pediatrician come?

1572
01:51:00,380 --> 01:51:03,390
I suggest you go home. 
Try and relax. OK?

1573
01:51:06,460 --> 01:51:07,510
Will it be alright?

1574
01:51:07,590 --> 01:51:10,000
Everything will be fine. 
Don't stress.

1575
01:51:10,420 --> 01:51:12,210
I'll wait till Honey shows up.

1576
01:51:13,170 --> 01:51:15,490
Drive carefully.

1577
01:51:30,040 --> 01:51:31,250
Mr Batra?

1578
01:51:32,880 --> 01:51:34,340
Are you the father?

1579
01:51:35,670 --> 01:51:38,210
No, he's on his way.

1580
01:51:38,840 --> 01:51:40,300
Send him in as soon as 
he gets here.

1581
01:51:40,380 --> 01:51:41,790
How's the child?

1582
01:51:43,380 --> 01:51:46,150
It's serious. 
She's in an incubator.

1583
01:51:47,130 --> 01:51:48,090
She?

1584
01:51:48,870 --> 01:51:50,250
Do you want to see her?

1585
01:51:50,960 --> 01:51:52,670
Follow me.

1586
01:52:16,210 --> 01:52:17,210
Mr Batra...

1587
01:52:18,630 --> 01:52:19,560
Come.

1588
01:52:32,380 --> 01:52:34,670
Some premature infants cannot 
swallow or breathe properly...

1589
01:52:34,790 --> 01:52:36,880
...so they're fed intravenously.

1590
01:52:53,630 --> 01:52:55,210
Will she make it?

1591
01:53:00,710 --> 01:53:02,290
Can't say.

1592
01:53:04,920 --> 01:53:06,540
It seems difficult.

1593
01:53:07,290 --> 01:53:09,710
We'll keep her in the ICU.

1594
01:53:54,920 --> 01:53:57,130
Brother, you have a girl.

1595
01:54:40,590 --> 01:54:41,500
Moni...

1596
01:54:49,040 --> 01:54:50,500
Have you seen her?

1597
01:54:53,210 --> 01:54:55,440
Let me see Chuhiya just once.

1598
01:54:58,090 --> 01:54:59,880
You named her without me.

1599
01:55:01,040 --> 01:55:06,510
She's so small. So tiny. 
Like a little mouse.

1600
01:55:08,540 --> 01:55:10,040
Will she be alright?

1601
01:55:11,810 --> 01:55:13,210
Take me to her.

1602
01:55:14,420 --> 01:55:17,510
- Please tell the nurse. 
- Sure.

1603
01:56:14,090 --> 01:56:15,090
You're still up?

1604
01:56:15,380 --> 01:56:16,500
How's the baby?

1605
01:56:19,750 --> 01:56:20,790
She's still in the incubator.

1606
01:56:32,070 --> 01:56:33,380
Sorry.

1607
01:56:34,160 --> 01:56:35,880
Deepu, I'm sorry.

1608
01:57:16,080 --> 01:57:21,260
On this bleak morning

1609
01:57:21,920 --> 01:57:27,180
Darkness lingering

1610
01:57:40,750 --> 01:57:46,510
The waves shall meet the shore

1611
01:57:46,590 --> 01:57:50,340
Though the near seems so far away

1612
01:57:51,170 --> 01:57:55,890
I know my heart is to blame

1613
01:57:57,170 --> 01:58:02,370
May all be spared this suffering

1614
01:58:38,980 --> 01:58:44,560
Whatever you've lost 
you shall find

1615
01:58:44,750 --> 01:58:50,520
Whatever is broken 
shall be restored

1616
01:58:51,380 --> 01:58:54,290
The baby is critical. 
Let's just pray.

1617
01:59:05,960 --> 01:59:11,580
Whatever you've lost 
you shall find

1618
01:59:11,880 --> 01:59:17,020
Whatever is broken 
shall be restored

1619
01:59:17,210 --> 01:59:22,760
Who knows where my journey 
has led me

1620
01:59:22,960 --> 01:59:27,200
All our dreams are now shattered

1621
01:59:28,420 --> 01:59:33,160
I know my heart is to blame

1622
01:59:34,510 --> 01:59:39,680
May all be spared this suffering

1623
02:00:42,440 --> 02:00:43,630
What's happened, brother?

1624
02:02:08,140 --> 02:02:10,370
Baby! The alarm's gone off.

1625
02:02:11,660 --> 02:02:14,500
- It has not. 
- Varun, it's time. Come on.

1626
02:02:14,840 --> 02:02:16,850
S***!

1627
02:02:17,170 --> 02:02:18,880
Mama, Papa!

1628
02:02:18,960 --> 02:02:20,630
It's time.

1629
02:02:20,710 --> 02:02:22,090
The grim reaper's here?

1630
02:02:22,590 --> 02:02:25,790
Grim reaper? No! It's time to take Deepu 
to the hospital.

1631
02:02:26,420 --> 02:02:27,840
Varun, where's my maternity bag?

1632
02:02:27,920 --> 02:02:29,800
Under the bed. Drag it out!

1633
02:02:29,880 --> 02:02:31,960
What? Are you crazy?

1634
02:02:32,040 --> 02:02:33,840
You get it out! Fast.

1635
02:02:33,920 --> 02:02:36,610
I'm coming. Don't bend.

1636
02:02:38,590 --> 02:02:39,960
Oh sh**!

1637
02:02:40,640 --> 02:02:43,020
- What's wrong? 
- My back.

1638
02:02:43,590 --> 02:02:46,130
My son's slip-dicks.

1639
02:02:46,210 --> 02:02:48,710
No, Ma! My disc.

1640
02:02:48,790 --> 02:02:52,380
- Come on, guys. 
- I'll drive. Don't stress.

1641
02:02:52,460 --> 02:02:54,300
Shut up, Mom. 
You're a bad driver.

1642
02:02:54,380 --> 02:02:56,790
- I can drive too. 
- Please...

1643
02:02:56,920 --> 02:02:58,920
Where's your phone?

1644
02:02:59,420 --> 02:03:01,170
A cab will take 11 minutes 
to get here.

1645
02:03:01,250 --> 02:03:03,580
- Password? 
- It's the same!

1646
02:03:04,670 --> 02:03:05,920
Varun, come on.

1647
02:03:06,460 --> 02:03:07,510
Hurry up, son.

1648
02:03:07,590 --> 02:03:09,560
It's an emergency.

1649
02:03:09,790 --> 02:03:11,330
Coming, sister-in-law.

1650
02:03:11,500 --> 02:03:13,080
Hurry up!

1651
02:03:14,040 --> 02:03:15,990
- Open the door. 
- Hurry up.

1652
02:03:17,040 --> 02:03:18,150
Mama...

1653
02:03:20,890 --> 02:03:24,960
We're taking Monika with us. 
Bring her child and Papa in an Ola.

1654
02:03:25,040 --> 02:03:27,730
- Hola? 
- Not Hola. Hire an Ola!

1655
02:03:27,960 --> 02:03:31,280
How can Hola be in Mumbai? 
Close the door!

1656
02:03:31,920 --> 02:03:33,510
- Let's go. 
- Wait!

1657
02:03:34,380 --> 02:03:37,630
Give me the maternity bag.

1658
02:03:45,750 --> 02:03:47,590
- Where to? 
- This way.

1659
02:03:47,670 --> 02:03:50,580
- Varun! 
- Coming.

1660
02:03:51,090 --> 02:03:52,210
Sister-in-law, hurry!

1661
02:03:53,290 --> 02:03:55,920
Varun. Varun!

1662
02:03:56,920 --> 02:03:58,920
I'm here.

1663
02:03:59,380 --> 02:04:01,460
- Where were you? 
- Changing.

1664
02:04:01,540 --> 02:04:03,090
Though it sounds pretty primitive...

1665
02:04:03,170 --> 02:04:06,220
...but squatting is an 
excellent position...

1666
02:04:06,590 --> 02:04:08,120
Don't talk rubbish!

1667
02:04:08,250 --> 02:04:10,090
You will not deliver my child.

1668
02:04:10,170 --> 02:04:13,180
- Where is Mrs Joshi? 
- Where is she?

1669
02:04:13,260 --> 02:04:16,710
She's gone to the US for further studies. 
She'll be back in a year.

1670
02:04:16,790 --> 02:04:20,590
By the way, relax. 
Let me and these two idiots do our job.

1671
02:04:20,670 --> 02:04:23,290
Varun, get this damn thing out of me.

1672
02:04:23,460 --> 02:04:26,120
Yes, calm down. 
Just calm down!

1673
02:04:26,500 --> 02:04:27,920
Yes, good.

1674
02:04:28,090 --> 02:04:29,880
That's eye drops.

1675
02:04:29,960 --> 02:04:32,110
I know. This is for me.

1676
02:04:33,710 --> 02:04:36,530
- He's rinsing his eyes with eyedrops. 
- Relax, Mrs Batra, I got this.

1677
02:04:36,960 --> 02:04:39,500
We've got this. OK, now please...

1678
02:04:40,250 --> 02:04:42,710
"O Mother of Life, 
O Father of the Universe.

1679
02:04:42,920 --> 02:04:46,250
Doctor, this is not a temple. 
Get the kid out.

1680
02:04:46,420 --> 02:04:48,130
Get the kid out! What you doing?

1681
02:04:48,210 --> 02:04:50,920
Mrs Batra, please. 
It takes a bit of time.

1682
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:54,130
I got this. Trust me. Breathe.

1683
02:04:58,290 --> 02:04:59,840
Careful!

1684
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:03,290
Mr Batra.

1685
02:05:04,130 --> 02:05:05,460
She's ready to see you.

1686
02:05:36,090 --> 02:05:39,920
She's so pretty. 
She's just like Varun.

1687
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:43,080
Her eyes and her forehead 
are just like Varun's.

1688
02:05:53,840 --> 02:05:54,790
Come!

1689
02:05:55,540 --> 02:05:56,920
Come in.

1690
02:06:41,110 --> 02:06:42,190
Get me a home

1691
02:06:45,990 --> 02:06:47,170
Make it feel like home

1692
02:06:49,150 --> 02:06:50,940
Oh my God. This is original.

1693
02:07:00,780 --> 02:07:03,030
You called me lovingly, here I am

1694
02:07:03,110 --> 02:07:05,810
We look like a cool couple

1695
02:07:10,400 --> 02:07:12,660
You called me lovingly, here I am

1696
02:07:12,740 --> 02:07:15,070
We look like a cool couple

1697
02:07:15,150 --> 02:07:17,530
A sign from you is all I need

1698
02:07:17,610 --> 02:07:19,650
Now I want to spend my life with you

1699
02:07:20,400 --> 02:07:22,700
Make all your wishes come true

1700
02:07:24,820 --> 02:07:26,700
Just say yes, sweetheart

1701
02:07:26,780 --> 02:07:27,950
Get me a home

1702
02:07:29,110 --> 02:07:30,110
Get me a home

1703
02:07:31,530 --> 02:07:33,870
I'll get you a home in Chandigarh

1704
02:07:38,820 --> 02:07:41,110
Make me a home in Chandigarh

1705
02:07:56,200 --> 02:08:00,990
Your dreamy eyes, your Punjabi clothes, 
you ask for my heart

1706
02:08:01,070 --> 02:08:05,740
I'll get you anything you ask for. 
Swear to God

1707
02:08:05,820 --> 02:08:09,230
I'll spend every rupee on you

1708
02:08:13,110 --> 02:08:14,820
Empty my wallet

1709
02:08:14,900 --> 02:08:16,240
Get me a home

1710
02:08:19,530 --> 02:08:21,780
I'll get you a home in Chandigarh
