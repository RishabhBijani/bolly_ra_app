1
00:00:16,653 --> 00:00:18,798
'Inter-state bus terminus'

2
00:00:18,925 --> 00:00:20,883
'Fine builders'

3
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:33,175
Come on, move!
- "Glory to Lord Rama!"

4
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,215
"Glory to Lord Krishna!"

5
00:00:37,507 --> 00:00:39,423
"Glory to Lord Rama!"

6
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:51,258
"Glory to Lord Krishna!"

7
00:00:51,348 --> 00:00:54,287
"Glory to Lord Rama!"

8
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:57,758
Is that him?
- Please let me go.

9
00:00:57,925 --> 00:00:59,465
I don't know, sir.

10
00:00:59,673 --> 00:01:00,668
Please let me go.

11
00:01:00,758 --> 00:01:02,925
Buy oranges!

12
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:05,175
"Lord Ram."

13
00:01:05,673 --> 00:01:07,840
Let me go, sir.
I don't know.

14
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:11,493
I think it's him.

15
00:01:11,953 --> 00:01:15,403
"Lord Ram. Lord Krishna."

16
00:01:15,493 --> 00:01:18,245
"Lord Ram."

17
00:01:19,078 --> 00:01:22,287
"Lord Ram. Lord Krishna."

18
00:01:22,453 --> 00:01:25,370
"Lord Ram. Lord Krishna."

19
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:28,530
"Lord Ram."

20
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:31,870
"Lord Ram."

21
00:01:31,995 --> 00:01:34,530
"Lord Ram."

22
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:35,447
Government hospital?

23
00:01:35,537 --> 00:01:36,953
Good morning, professor Govind.
- Yes.

24
00:01:37,953 --> 00:01:39,493
I said, good morning,
Professor Govind.

25
00:01:41,078 --> 00:01:42,328
You're mistaken.

26
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:44,537
My name is Dharamprakash.

27
00:01:45,078 --> 00:01:46,578
Govind, Dharamprakash,

28
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:48,828
Wilson, Srivastav, Deshpande...

29
00:01:49,203 --> 00:01:52,078
Choose any name,
it makes no difference to me.

30
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:01,328
Adil Khan, Senior S.P. Bhopal.

31
00:02:02,493 --> 00:02:03,620
I know.

32
00:02:04,493 --> 00:02:07,245
I've been waiting for four years
to meet you.

33
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:08,870
Shall we?

34
00:02:09,912 --> 00:02:13,287
There are many charges on him
from here to Nandighat.

35
00:02:13,537 --> 00:02:14,863
'Govind Ram Suryavanshi.'

36
00:02:14,953 --> 00:02:17,953
'He was born in a rich
business family in Mumbai.'

37
00:02:18,162 --> 00:02:20,870
'After passing out of the renowned
Doon School of our country,'

38
00:02:21,037 --> 00:02:24,245
'he studied at the
London School of Economics.'

39
00:02:24,703 --> 00:02:26,738
'After completing his doctorate
from Oxford University'

40
00:02:26,828 --> 00:02:27,828
'he returned to India.'

41
00:02:27,995 --> 00:02:29,863
'Touched by the exploitation
of the poor,'

42
00:02:29,953 --> 00:02:32,745
'he gave up everything
and joined the Maoist movement.'

43
00:02:32,995 --> 00:02:35,655
Mr Govind has been underground
for past 30 years.

44
00:02:35,745 --> 00:02:39,197
He's known as important ideologue
of the Naxal Movement.

45
00:02:39,287 --> 00:02:40,162
'Naxalism,'

46
00:02:40,287 --> 00:02:41,403
'which the Prime Minister
Manmohan Singh'

47
00:02:41,493 --> 00:02:45,245
'thinks the biggest threat
to internal security.'

48
00:02:45,537 --> 00:02:48,870
'More than 200 districts in the
country is affected by it.'

49
00:02:49,162 --> 00:02:51,328
'It all started 45 years ago'

50
00:02:51,493 --> 00:02:53,078
'in Naxalbari,
a village in Bengal,'

51
00:02:53,203 --> 00:02:56,197
'when poor farmers killed a
landlord'

52
00:02:56,287 --> 00:02:57,787
'to swan their right
over their land.'

53
00:02:58,413 --> 00:03:00,537
'Naxalism started from there.'

54
00:03:00,662 --> 00:03:02,822
'Naxalism has spread to
East Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh,'

55
00:03:02,912 --> 00:03:04,662
'Maharashtra, Bengal, Bihar,'

56
00:03:04,787 --> 00:03:08,537
'Odisha, Jharkhand,
and many other states.'

57
00:03:08,828 --> 00:03:11,493
'Thousands of tribals
have taken up arms.'

58
00:03:11,662 --> 00:03:13,995
'They are fighting against
the system of the country.'

59
00:03:14,203 --> 00:03:16,403
'It is believed that the tribals'

60
00:03:16,493 --> 00:03:17,953
'are given'

61
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,662
'arms and training from terrorist
organisations in India and abroad.'

62
00:03:21,953 --> 00:03:24,953
'The reason for the increase
of Naxalism in these areas is that'

63
00:03:25,078 --> 00:03:27,537
'there's been no development here
for the last 65 years.'

64
00:03:28,203 --> 00:03:30,403
'Today you speak of development'

65
00:03:30,493 --> 00:03:33,370
'only because under that pretext,
you want to seize their land'

66
00:03:34,078 --> 00:03:37,370
'which is rich in iron,
manganese, coal,'

67
00:03:37,578 --> 00:03:40,287
'bauxite and many other minerals.'

68
00:03:40,453 --> 00:03:41,537
Look,

69
00:03:41,745 --> 00:03:43,287
it is simple,

70
00:03:43,953 --> 00:03:47,953
unless we utilise these
natural resources in the land,

71
00:03:48,078 --> 00:03:49,703
how can there be development?

72
00:03:50,493 --> 00:03:52,537
That is why we are signing

73
00:03:52,703 --> 00:03:55,578
this 15 billion agreement with

74
00:03:55,787 --> 00:03:58,328
the huge Mahanta Group!

75
00:03:58,493 --> 00:04:01,828
And the rehabilitation plan
for the tribals is ready.

76
00:04:02,953 --> 00:04:07,203
As Chairman of the Mahanta Group,
I want to assure you all that

77
00:04:07,662 --> 00:04:11,413
the needs of Nandighat
people will be fulfilled.

78
00:04:11,578 --> 00:04:13,578
Concrete houses for the tribals,

79
00:04:13,745 --> 00:04:16,578
hospitals, an international school,

80
00:04:16,745 --> 00:04:19,162
and a world class university.

81
00:04:20,037 --> 00:04:21,363
Along with business,

82
00:04:21,453 --> 00:04:25,197
the Mahanta Group takes its social
responsibility very seriously.

83
00:04:25,287 --> 00:04:26,413
Mr Mahanta,

84
00:04:26,995 --> 00:04:28,870
will there be seats for

85
00:04:29,078 --> 00:04:30,662
tribal children in your
world class university?

86
00:04:30,787 --> 00:04:31,995
Look...
- Sir,

87
00:04:33,078 --> 00:04:35,537
it's obvious that the tribals
do not want to move.

88
00:04:35,662 --> 00:04:37,328
Will they be moved by force?

89
00:04:37,453 --> 00:04:38,370
Look,

90
00:04:38,493 --> 00:04:41,245
when the media succumbs
to Maoist propaganda,

91
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,745
how will the public know the truth?

92
00:04:44,578 --> 00:04:46,703
The tribals are our brothers.

93
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,328
No one can force them.

94
00:04:49,578 --> 00:04:51,662
Force will be used
only against the Naxals.

95
00:04:52,037 --> 00:04:54,870
Their menace will be wiped out
from Nandighat.

96
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,870
This is the government's promise.

97
00:04:58,037 --> 00:04:59,662
We are all ready.

98
00:04:59,995 --> 00:05:02,120
What I don't understand is

99
00:05:02,537 --> 00:05:05,120
while you advocate democracy,

100
00:05:05,745 --> 00:05:07,953
you're unwilling to speak with the

101
00:05:08,078 --> 00:05:09,738
government of the
world's biggest democracy.

102
00:05:09,828 --> 00:05:12,287
I don't believe in a democracy

103
00:05:13,078 --> 00:05:15,120
which doesn't respect the poor.

104
00:05:15,287 --> 00:05:16,572
We shall talk about your
extremist violence

105
00:05:16,662 --> 00:05:19,870
and police counter-violence
some other day, Professor.

106
00:05:20,828 --> 00:05:23,287
For now, I just want to ask
some basic questions.

107
00:05:23,537 --> 00:05:26,537
Before you waste your time
on meaningless questions,

108
00:05:27,328 --> 00:05:29,037
let me clarify,

109
00:05:30,037 --> 00:05:31,828
I only do three things now,

110
00:05:32,578 --> 00:05:34,245
reading, writing,

111
00:05:34,995 --> 00:05:36,078
and teaching.

112
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:41,912
You can ask me any question
related to this, I will answer.

113
00:05:43,413 --> 00:05:45,037
Other than that,

114
00:05:45,828 --> 00:05:46,912
I won't say a word.

115
00:05:48,203 --> 00:05:50,120
And that's my right, too.

116
00:05:53,078 --> 00:05:55,828
Professor, if you choose to
stay quiet, fine.

117
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:58,822
In my records,
you're responsible for the death

118
00:05:58,912 --> 00:06:01,287
of 91 policemen
and 150 innocent civilians.

119
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:12,620
KK,

120
00:06:13,037 --> 00:06:14,745
how are things in Nandighat?

121
00:06:15,037 --> 00:06:16,245
Fantastic!

122
00:06:16,413 --> 00:06:19,703
You've shaken the entire Movement
by arresting Govind Suryavanshi.

123
00:06:20,287 --> 00:06:22,078
Did he give any information
about Nandighat?

124
00:06:22,245 --> 00:06:24,745
Not yet, but Rhea won't spare him.

125
00:06:25,828 --> 00:06:27,078
Give my regards to Rhea.

126
00:06:27,413 --> 00:06:29,822
By the way,
isn't your college reunion today?

127
00:06:29,912 --> 00:06:31,662
Yes, it will be a boring party.

128
00:06:32,037 --> 00:06:34,620
But we will have a blast tonight.

129
00:06:35,453 --> 00:06:37,370
Lots of fireworks.
- Why?

130
00:06:37,703 --> 00:06:38,953
Are you planning something?

131
00:06:40,245 --> 00:06:41,995
Is it an encounter? Tell me.

132
00:06:42,203 --> 00:06:45,493
I'll make an encounter to remember.

133
00:06:46,078 --> 00:06:49,162
I'll kill one such leader that
you'll be celebrating all year.

134
00:06:49,495 --> 00:06:50,905
Who? Rajan?

135
00:06:50,995 --> 00:06:52,203
Be patient, my friend.

136
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:54,530
Read it in tomorrow's newspaper.

137
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:55,953
I can't bloody wait.

138
00:06:56,453 --> 00:06:58,493
Get that rascal!
- 'I will.'

139
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,870
Who is it?
- Somebody named Kabir.

140
00:07:03,287 --> 00:07:04,287
Kabir?

141
00:07:04,495 --> 00:07:06,245
Hello, Kabir?
Is that really you?

142
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:07,988
'The one and only!'

143
00:07:08,078 --> 00:07:10,947
Oh God, I don't believe this.
Where have you been, man!

144
00:07:11,037 --> 00:07:12,578
'I'm good. I'm here, Rhea.'

145
00:07:12,703 --> 00:07:14,078
Wow! Are you coming to the party?

146
00:07:14,413 --> 00:07:15,828
'Yes, but where is my friend?'

147
00:07:16,078 --> 00:07:17,537
Right here.

148
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:19,662
It's Kabir!

149
00:07:20,537 --> 00:07:22,078
Even he is attending
the college party.

150
00:07:26,328 --> 00:07:29,120
You've been angry for 7 years.
It'll give you an ulcer.

151
00:07:29,287 --> 00:07:30,703
Can't you forgive him?

152
00:07:31,328 --> 00:07:32,495
You are acting like a kid.

153
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:35,787
'How can I say
what Kabir meant for me?'

154
00:07:36,493 --> 00:07:37,995
'He was more than a friend to me.'

155
00:07:40,203 --> 00:07:42,662
'He had no one else in this world,
but for me.'

156
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:45,745
'What are you doing?'

157
00:07:45,953 --> 00:07:47,245
'I was day dreaming.'

158
00:07:47,413 --> 00:07:49,328
'I'm going back to the
government college now.'

159
00:07:50,413 --> 00:07:51,488
'As it is, the course was tough'

160
00:07:51,578 --> 00:07:53,162
'and now they have
raised the fees too.'

161
00:07:53,537 --> 00:07:54,995
'Your fees have been paid.'

162
00:07:55,703 --> 00:07:57,245
'I don't want your dad's money.'

163
00:07:57,662 --> 00:07:59,912
'I used dad's money
to pay my fees.'

164
00:08:00,245 --> 00:08:01,620
'With my scholarship,
I paid yours.'

165
00:08:11,245 --> 00:08:13,120
'What's this?
- Our future.'

166
00:08:17,493 --> 00:08:18,493
'Look boss,'

167
00:08:18,662 --> 00:08:20,572
'until now we did
everything together,'

168
00:08:20,662 --> 00:08:22,162
'but now our paths are different.'

169
00:08:22,328 --> 00:08:25,493
'Stop delivering dialogues
and just sign the form.'

170
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:27,405
'But, I don't want to do this.'

171
00:08:27,495 --> 00:08:28,578
'No ifs and buts.'

172
00:08:29,413 --> 00:08:31,662
'I'll make you a cop,
come on, sign it.'

173
00:08:33,745 --> 00:08:35,745
'Freezing cold, torrential rains,
or scorching heat,'

174
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:37,870
'in thunderstorms or floods,
night or day,'

175
00:08:38,245 --> 00:08:41,662
'once you're on duty,
nothing else matters.'

176
00:08:41,828 --> 00:08:43,370
'You have to stand,'

177
00:08:43,493 --> 00:08:45,037
'come what may.'

178
00:08:45,203 --> 00:08:47,413
'Sir, what do we do
if we want to pee?'

179
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,828
'Reform yourself, Kabir.
You joke all the time.'

180
00:08:53,745 --> 00:08:54,697
'Stop this nonsense.'

181
00:08:54,787 --> 00:08:55,863
'You are speaking nonsense.'

182
00:08:55,953 --> 00:08:57,828
'Your seats are reserved...
- No, Kabir!'

183
00:08:57,953 --> 00:09:00,537
'One moment.
- What are you doing, Mahesh?'

184
00:09:00,662 --> 00:09:01,870
'Let him go.'

185
00:09:01,995 --> 00:09:05,238
'This is not the way to talk to a
weak person. - Who are you?'

186
00:09:05,328 --> 00:09:07,280
'I had asked Kabir
not to get involved in any fights.'

187
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:08,447
'Let it be, Kabir.'

188
00:09:08,537 --> 00:09:10,828
'And not ruin his life
over petty fights. - Stop it!'

189
00:09:11,287 --> 00:09:12,447
'I said stop it!
- But Kabir...'

190
00:09:12,537 --> 00:09:14,238
'Leave him.
- I say leave him!'

191
00:09:14,328 --> 00:09:15,828
'He could never control himself.'

192
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,537
'I cannot apologise.'

193
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,328
'This is how I am,'

194
00:09:25,495 --> 00:09:26,578
'and this is how I will be!'

195
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:29,037
'If you knew this already,
why did you bring me here?'

196
00:09:29,162 --> 00:09:31,238
'I made a mistake! A big mistake!'

197
00:09:31,328 --> 00:09:32,572
'Dad was right.'

198
00:09:32,662 --> 00:09:34,037
'You can never achieve something.'

199
00:09:34,328 --> 00:09:35,995
'Don't ever show me
your face again!'

200
00:09:43,828 --> 00:09:45,203
'After all these years...'

201
00:09:45,493 --> 00:09:47,413
'I don't know where was he,
what was he up to.'

202
00:09:48,787 --> 00:09:50,703
'Now, he shows up himself.'

203
00:09:52,413 --> 00:09:54,405
'Does he think
I'll give him a hug?'

204
00:09:54,495 --> 00:09:55,620
Kabir!

205
00:09:59,493 --> 00:10:01,078
This guy...

206
00:10:03,537 --> 00:10:06,203
Forgive me, my lord and master!

207
00:10:06,453 --> 00:10:08,287
I will never disobey you!

208
00:10:08,493 --> 00:10:09,620
You're my master.

209
00:10:09,787 --> 00:10:12,578
If you don't forgive me today,
I'll kill myself.

210
00:10:12,787 --> 00:10:14,745
I'll do everything you say.

211
00:10:15,203 --> 00:10:16,703
Stop being melodramatic.

212
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,413
Nothing much...

213
00:10:23,662 --> 00:10:25,413
I did some boring jobs for a while

214
00:10:25,912 --> 00:10:27,745
then joined an electronics company.

215
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:31,620
And then, I started making
my own mobile phones.

216
00:10:32,703 --> 00:10:34,037
What, mobile phones?
- Yes.

217
00:10:34,662 --> 00:10:35,787
Your own brand?

218
00:10:36,703 --> 00:10:38,037
Have you ever tried this handset?

219
00:10:39,037 --> 00:10:40,037
RAK?

220
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:41,703
What is RAK mobile?

221
00:10:44,245 --> 00:10:45,495
You'll never reform.

222
00:10:46,413 --> 00:10:48,037
R.A.K.

223
00:10:48,495 --> 00:10:50,203
Rhea, Adil, Kabir!
- Yes!

224
00:10:50,328 --> 00:10:52,197
No wonder it flopped.

225
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,578
Flopped?

226
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:57,493
The first consignment sold out
in MP and Chhattisgarh in a jiffy.

227
00:10:58,912 --> 00:11:02,703
But after two months...
there were complaints

228
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:04,912
and the dealers stopped paying.

229
00:11:05,493 --> 00:11:07,287
The bank guys came home.

230
00:11:07,828 --> 00:11:08,870
I had a fight with them.

231
00:11:10,328 --> 00:11:12,953
I ended up hitting a cop.

232
00:11:13,162 --> 00:11:14,537
They arrested me.

233
00:11:15,037 --> 00:11:16,162
You hit a cop?

234
00:11:17,037 --> 00:11:18,037
Well done.

235
00:11:18,493 --> 00:11:20,037
So, for how long
were you locked up?

236
00:11:20,787 --> 00:11:22,280
Let it be.

237
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:23,662
At least he's back.

238
00:11:24,413 --> 00:11:25,287
Good evening, sir.

239
00:11:25,453 --> 00:11:28,493
12 km from here, a village fair
is being held at Tulasi mountain.

240
00:11:28,703 --> 00:11:31,995
We got information that the Naxals
are holding a zonal meet there.

241
00:11:32,162 --> 00:11:34,613
Central Committee members, Shivram
and Chakravarthy are expected.

242
00:11:34,703 --> 00:11:37,120
The Zonal Commander,
Rajan, will also be present.

243
00:11:37,328 --> 00:11:38,328
Rajan?

244
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,162
How true is your information?

245
00:11:40,287 --> 00:11:42,947
We've cross checked it, sir.
Intelligence has confirmed it too.

246
00:11:43,037 --> 00:11:45,162
They're planning to retaliate
against Govind's arrest.

247
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:46,287
Alright.

248
00:11:47,037 --> 00:11:48,370
Keep me informed.

249
00:11:48,828 --> 00:11:50,197
I will be in the Control Room
in an hour's time.

250
00:11:50,287 --> 00:11:51,287
Right, sir.

251
00:11:59,453 --> 00:12:01,493
Sir, please leave from there.

252
00:12:01,912 --> 00:12:03,912
Comrades have gathered
behind the temple.

253
00:12:04,287 --> 00:12:05,703
Their meeting is about to begin.

254
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:07,203
'Sir, Kamal Kishor here.'

255
00:12:08,078 --> 00:12:09,662
Hello KK, Rathod here.

256
00:12:09,787 --> 00:12:10,787
'Good evening, sir.'

257
00:12:10,912 --> 00:12:12,037
We have the confirmation.

258
00:12:12,495 --> 00:12:13,537
Rajan is here.

259
00:12:13,787 --> 00:12:15,493
He's 400 yards away
from the target.

260
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:16,620
Good, very good, KK.

261
00:12:16,912 --> 00:12:18,662
Don't let Rajan get away, SP!

262
00:12:18,912 --> 00:12:21,203
Kill him in an encounter.
Just finish him!

263
00:12:22,493 --> 00:12:25,495
That was the
Home Minister speaking, KK.

264
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,370
Sir.

265
00:12:27,828 --> 00:12:29,953
Be very careful, KK.
- Sir.

266
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:01,912
KK, can you hear me?

267
00:13:02,078 --> 00:13:03,537
Try the second line.
Hurry up!

268
00:13:03,662 --> 00:13:04,662
KK!

269
00:13:21,745 --> 00:13:29,162
"Always be prepared
for the worst..."

270
00:13:34,578 --> 00:13:36,078
KK, can you hear me?

271
00:13:36,495 --> 00:13:37,495
KK...
- Oh God!

272
00:13:37,703 --> 00:13:39,453
Sir...
- KK, can you hear us?

273
00:13:40,328 --> 00:13:41,995
Sir, it's a trap.
We are surrounded.

274
00:13:42,995 --> 00:13:44,953
Hello, KK?

275
00:13:50,662 --> 00:13:52,787
'No entry'

276
00:13:54,912 --> 00:13:56,828
Lal Salam! (Red Salute)
- Lal Salam!

277
00:13:59,037 --> 00:14:01,037
Lal Salam!

278
00:14:01,828 --> 00:14:03,745
Lal Salam!

279
00:14:10,078 --> 00:14:11,030
Excuse me, sir.

280
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,447
Sir, can you tell us
about the massacre...

281
00:14:13,537 --> 00:14:15,662
Sir, can you please tell us

282
00:14:15,787 --> 00:14:16,745
which group has done this?

283
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:19,162
Sir...
- We're investigating the matter.

284
00:14:19,413 --> 00:14:21,403
We'll talk with you later.
- Sir...

285
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:23,863
Sir, can you please tell us how long
it will take for the investigation?

286
00:14:23,953 --> 00:14:25,947
'The massacre of 84 policemen,'

287
00:14:26,037 --> 00:14:28,403
'paramilitary personnel
at Nandighat is confirmed.'

288
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:31,245
'Their funeral with state honours'

289
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:33,323
'will take place
at 4 o'clock today.'

290
00:14:33,413 --> 00:14:35,328
'Meanwhile, Naxalite leader Rajan'

291
00:14:35,453 --> 00:14:38,280
'spoke to the media
at an unidentified location.'

292
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:40,495
'We wish to declare
before the world,'

293
00:14:41,162 --> 00:14:43,870
'though the stooges
of the government'

294
00:14:44,037 --> 00:14:46,703
'falsely label us
murderers and terrorists,'

295
00:14:46,912 --> 00:14:50,662
'every attack of ours
is in defence of poor tribals'

296
00:14:50,995 --> 00:14:54,120
'who have been crushed
by the police and the state.'

297
00:14:54,995 --> 00:14:59,537
'We will not allow the government to
take even one inch of tribal land.'

298
00:15:00,578 --> 00:15:01,578
'Lal Salam.'

299
00:15:01,703 --> 00:15:04,613
'After the massacre of the
Nandighat, the Naxal zonal...'

300
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:07,662
You have to take the responsibility
of this massacre.

301
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,287
But sir,

302
00:15:09,578 --> 00:15:11,787
the Home Minister himself
allowed the attack.

303
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:14,745
He was in the Control room...

304
00:15:14,953 --> 00:15:16,537
When did I give you permission?

305
00:15:16,662 --> 00:15:17,912
Did I say

306
00:15:18,078 --> 00:15:20,078
the information is accurate
and send them charging?

307
00:15:21,203 --> 00:15:23,745
In fact,
you conned me into it, DGP.

308
00:15:24,953 --> 00:15:28,493
Please, don't blame me
for your failure.

309
00:15:28,662 --> 00:15:31,245
'This incident raises questions
about the Mahanta deal.'

310
00:15:31,493 --> 00:15:33,072
'Prashant Mahanta, the Chairman
of the Mahanta Group'

311
00:15:33,162 --> 00:15:35,703
'has called a press conference.'

312
00:15:35,953 --> 00:15:38,328
'We take you to his headquarters.'

313
00:15:38,453 --> 00:15:40,953
'Where even the police
and CRPF aren't safe,'

314
00:15:41,493 --> 00:15:44,203
'how can we risk setting up
a plant there?'

315
00:15:44,745 --> 00:15:48,493
'Until the government guarantees
the life of every worker,'

316
00:15:48,953 --> 00:15:51,572
'we will not begin any work.'

317
00:15:51,662 --> 00:15:53,403
'After Mahanta's statement...'

318
00:15:53,493 --> 00:15:55,328
Tell us, DGP,

319
00:15:55,493 --> 00:15:57,953
are you capable of dealing
with this problem

320
00:15:58,162 --> 00:15:59,620
or do I ask Mr Mahanta

321
00:15:59,787 --> 00:16:01,787
to sign the agreement
with Rajan instead?

322
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,203
Show some action, DGP.

323
00:16:05,537 --> 00:16:06,537
Action.

324
00:16:08,995 --> 00:16:09,995
Sir.

325
00:16:10,493 --> 00:16:12,995
Instant retaliation will have
its own complications.

326
00:16:13,493 --> 00:16:16,995
The enemy is not waiting at the
border whom we can attack.

327
00:16:17,453 --> 00:16:20,787
This massacre has emotionally
disturbed our men.

328
00:16:22,328 --> 00:16:24,120
Driven by vengeance,
they may commit excesses,

329
00:16:24,493 --> 00:16:25,870
and innocents will die.

330
00:16:26,078 --> 00:16:27,238
That will provoke
the tribals further,

331
00:16:27,328 --> 00:16:28,447
which is what the Naxals want.

332
00:16:28,537 --> 00:16:29,787
I know, Adil,

333
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:32,912
but these politicians
have their own compulsions.

334
00:16:33,703 --> 00:16:35,403
To fulfil their selfish motives,

335
00:16:35,493 --> 00:16:36,828
they keep pressurising us.

336
00:16:36,953 --> 00:16:39,328
Do they even care
how many men we have lost?

337
00:16:41,413 --> 00:16:43,370
We lost such a brave officer
like KK.

338
00:16:44,453 --> 00:16:46,203
They will hand out
a little compensation

339
00:16:46,328 --> 00:16:47,953
for publicity, that's all.

340
00:16:49,037 --> 00:16:50,493
In such a terrible situation,

341
00:16:51,287 --> 00:16:53,078
who'd want to go to Nandighat?

342
00:16:53,745 --> 00:16:55,703
What? How can you do this?

343
00:16:56,037 --> 00:16:58,403
You took such a big decision
without even discussing it with me?

344
00:16:58,493 --> 00:16:59,578
I can't understand.

345
00:16:59,745 --> 00:17:01,120
Even I can't understand, Rhea.

346
00:17:02,037 --> 00:17:04,620
How can 84 policemen be
killed in one night?

347
00:17:04,912 --> 00:17:06,280
And how Nandighat

348
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:08,495
is ruled by terrorists
instead of the state?

349
00:17:10,328 --> 00:17:12,662
Why nobody wants to be
posted there as the SP?

350
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:14,953
Look Rhea,

351
00:17:16,037 --> 00:17:17,120
someone's got to do this.

352
00:17:17,287 --> 00:17:18,405
Right.

353
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:20,787
And you're the only one who
can move this mountain, right?

354
00:17:20,912 --> 00:17:23,328
There is no other man in the
entire police department, right?

355
00:17:24,953 --> 00:17:26,162
Talk to her.

356
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:27,953
She is overreacting.

357
00:17:28,203 --> 00:17:29,828
Obviously, she will.

358
00:17:30,078 --> 00:17:31,493
What you're doing is foolishness.

359
00:17:33,203 --> 00:17:35,245
It was so tough to get
a posting in the same city.

360
00:17:35,413 --> 00:17:38,037
We had just spoken
about starting a family

361
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:40,287
and he took a
transfer to Nandighat!

362
00:17:44,328 --> 00:17:45,745
Don't do this, Adil.

363
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:48,245
I don't see anything good in this.

364
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,120
'Nandighat'

365
00:18:09,162 --> 00:18:11,245
Which route are you taking?
- Main highway, sir.

366
00:18:11,413 --> 00:18:12,662
It is safer.

367
00:18:13,287 --> 00:18:14,620
No, we will go via Lakhimpur.

368
00:18:14,912 --> 00:18:17,037
But the forest there...
- So?

369
00:18:28,912 --> 00:18:30,537
'This is our territory.'

370
00:18:31,162 --> 00:18:34,662
'Policemen,
enter at your own risk'.

371
00:18:35,162 --> 00:18:37,703
'They are responsible
for their death'.

372
00:18:47,078 --> 00:18:50,078
How far is Lakhimpur from here?
- About 4-5 km, sir.

373
00:18:53,787 --> 00:18:55,403
Drive down the slope,
it'll pass through.

374
00:18:55,493 --> 00:18:56,745
But, sir...

375
00:18:57,413 --> 00:18:58,620
Take it down, Rajaram.

376
00:18:59,287 --> 00:19:00,287
Give me the keys.

377
00:19:00,537 --> 00:19:01,703
Get back in.

378
00:19:01,995 --> 00:19:03,078
Come, sir.

379
00:19:40,953 --> 00:19:44,912
'Police station'

380
00:19:51,453 --> 00:19:53,078
Why is the gate locked?
- I'll check, sir.

381
00:19:56,078 --> 00:19:57,078
Open!
- Sir.

382
00:19:57,328 --> 00:19:58,447
The keys are with the Inspector.

383
00:19:58,537 --> 00:20:00,787
Hurry up.
Tell Tewari the SP is here.

384
00:20:00,912 --> 00:20:02,078
Sir.

385
00:20:02,703 --> 00:20:04,120
Sorry, sir.

386
00:20:06,493 --> 00:20:08,328
Is this a police station
or a den of thieves?

387
00:20:14,703 --> 00:20:17,493
Sir. - How much area does
Lakhimpur police station cover?

388
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:19,453
2 km, sir.
- What?

389
00:20:19,662 --> 00:20:21,203
2 km?
- Yes, sir.

390
00:20:22,245 --> 00:20:24,870
But the next police station
is 23 km from here.

391
00:20:25,245 --> 00:20:28,995
There are roadblocks in each
direction 2 km from here.

392
00:20:29,245 --> 00:20:30,453
The staff fears to go there.

393
00:20:31,245 --> 00:20:33,537
Every new post we build,

394
00:20:33,745 --> 00:20:35,493
the Naxals blow it up
with dynamite.

395
00:20:37,037 --> 00:20:39,328
Then how do you get information
about the Naxals?

396
00:20:40,662 --> 00:20:42,162
Do you have informers in villages?

397
00:20:42,953 --> 00:20:44,493
How do you control crime here?

398
00:20:45,162 --> 00:20:46,745
Even if a murder is committed

399
00:20:47,078 --> 00:20:48,413
nobody reports it.

400
00:20:48,537 --> 00:20:51,537
All matters are settled in the
people's courts of the Naxals.

401
00:20:52,662 --> 00:20:54,703
It's very peaceful here, sir.

402
00:21:02,078 --> 00:21:03,493
Don't fire!

403
00:21:07,662 --> 00:21:09,078
Manager,

404
00:21:09,912 --> 00:21:11,703
came on your own?

405
00:21:12,495 --> 00:21:15,745
I thought you'd bring
the cops with you.

406
00:21:18,245 --> 00:21:20,197
Why do I need the cops,
when you're here, Mr Naga?

407
00:21:20,287 --> 00:21:22,493
When you're here...
- Manager,

408
00:21:23,493 --> 00:21:25,662
stop delivering dialogues.

409
00:21:26,828 --> 00:21:29,287
I'll put an end to your drama.

410
00:21:29,578 --> 00:21:32,828
Go ahead and plant the dynamite.

411
00:21:33,703 --> 00:21:35,822
Why are you getting angry, Mr Naga?

412
00:21:35,912 --> 00:21:39,037
We aren't outsiders. We'll listen
to... - Shut up, idiot!

413
00:21:40,245 --> 00:21:43,912
Your company buys this land for
pennies and mints billions, and we?

414
00:21:44,537 --> 00:21:47,655
We just ask for a donation of
2 million and you grumble.

415
00:21:47,745 --> 00:21:50,120
Give me a minute,
I'll arrange for it.

416
00:21:51,037 --> 00:21:53,995
That's all the time you have.
- Okay.

417
00:21:54,495 --> 00:21:57,328
Or in 60 seconds you'll be history.

418
00:21:59,453 --> 00:22:01,203
Hello...

419
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,655
"Ravishing youth..."

420
00:22:12,745 --> 00:22:16,995
"I'm impressed with your beauty."

421
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,493
"I can't do without you..."

422
00:22:24,912 --> 00:22:26,120
5...

423
00:22:30,662 --> 00:22:31,745
10...

424
00:22:32,828 --> 00:22:33,953
And...

425
00:22:34,413 --> 00:22:35,870
15. Total.

426
00:22:36,203 --> 00:22:37,953
Lal Salam!
- Lal Salam!

427
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:47,953
Hey!

428
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:49,370
What are you doing?

429
00:22:49,537 --> 00:22:51,828
I was taking my wages, Comrade.

430
00:22:52,413 --> 00:22:53,745
Is that so?
- Yes.

431
00:22:57,703 --> 00:23:00,578
That is what I like about you.

432
00:23:01,953 --> 00:23:05,203
You're very sharp with accounts.

433
00:23:06,328 --> 00:23:07,495
That I am.

434
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,037
It is with your money that they
buy arms and ammunition.

435
00:23:12,745 --> 00:23:15,037
This amounts to a criminal
conspiracy against the state

436
00:23:15,328 --> 00:23:17,537
for which I can arrest you

437
00:23:17,745 --> 00:23:20,245
under section 120-B and 121.

438
00:23:20,453 --> 00:23:23,203
Sir, I'm Ravinder Nath. Project
Manager of Cosmos Global Steel.

439
00:23:23,537 --> 00:23:25,620
Our pipeline work was stalled
since the past 4 years.

440
00:23:26,037 --> 00:23:29,245
Sorry, but the police does not even
reply to our request for protection.

441
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:31,037
We were losing millions every year.

442
00:23:31,203 --> 00:23:32,912
You tell us,
what option do we have?

443
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:35,703
If we settle with the Naxals
and work, you kill us.

444
00:23:35,828 --> 00:23:37,245
If we don't,
the losses prove fatal.

445
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:38,403
You tell us...
- We're helpless.

446
00:23:38,493 --> 00:23:39,447
Not only do we bear losses,

447
00:23:39,537 --> 00:23:41,162
but there is a threat
to our life as well.

448
00:23:41,287 --> 00:23:44,280
When there's a call from the
jungle, there's no cop in sight.

449
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:45,162
You'll get it.

450
00:23:45,662 --> 00:23:47,745
You will get both,
police help and protection.

451
00:23:48,203 --> 00:23:50,162
But you too will have to help us.

452
00:23:50,953 --> 00:23:53,370
I want to cut the Naxals' supplies.

453
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:56,537
They can't buy arms merely
with tribal donations.

454
00:23:57,493 --> 00:24:00,370
Remember,
we have to fight this war together.

455
00:24:00,703 --> 00:24:03,037
Our men don't understand politics.

456
00:24:03,493 --> 00:24:04,947
They can't understand

457
00:24:05,037 --> 00:24:08,370
why we're fighting against our
own countrymen and dying.

458
00:24:08,912 --> 00:24:11,703
They feel our politicians

459
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,537
don't want a solution.

460
00:24:13,745 --> 00:24:15,245
We're being used as scapegoats!

461
00:24:15,413 --> 00:24:16,953
The condition of
the camps is so bad

462
00:24:17,162 --> 00:24:19,787
Sir! - that even if they
escape Naxal bullets,

463
00:24:19,912 --> 00:24:21,488
malaria will kill them.
- Sir!

464
00:24:21,578 --> 00:24:24,662
A posting in the interiors
means no electricity... - Sir!

465
00:24:24,787 --> 00:24:26,447
No network,
- Sir!

466
00:24:26,537 --> 00:24:28,655
They can't talk to their
families for months. - Sir!

467
00:24:28,745 --> 00:24:31,370
What about our intelligence?
- That's our biggest problem.

468
00:24:32,037 --> 00:24:34,113
If that was foolproof
KK and Sarabjeet

469
00:24:34,203 --> 00:24:35,120
wouldn't have been trapped.

470
00:24:35,453 --> 00:24:37,120
The scariest part is,

471
00:24:37,537 --> 00:24:40,120
the villagers support
the Naxals totally.

472
00:24:41,037 --> 00:24:43,245
We declared a reward
of 1.2 million,

473
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:45,245
but nobody dares step forward.

474
00:24:45,578 --> 00:24:47,828
Since the Maoists
belong to the villages,

475
00:24:48,078 --> 00:24:50,287
they mix easily with them.

476
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:52,403
Their network is so strong,

477
00:24:52,493 --> 00:24:54,413
they're aware of all our movements.

478
00:24:54,912 --> 00:24:56,745
It's only because of this
that Rajan

479
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:59,370
and his two area commanders
Naga and Juhi

480
00:24:59,493 --> 00:25:01,912
have spread terror in Nandighat.

481
00:25:02,162 --> 00:25:04,995
We have to destroy
their control, at any cost.

482
00:25:18,328 --> 00:25:19,537
The police are here.

483
00:25:19,662 --> 00:25:21,162
Run!

484
00:25:25,745 --> 00:25:27,572
The police are here.

485
00:25:27,662 --> 00:25:30,493
The villagers have never seen
a government official.

486
00:25:30,912 --> 00:25:32,870
They think the police
is the government.

487
00:25:33,787 --> 00:25:35,995
They don't fear death as much as

488
00:25:36,245 --> 00:25:37,745
they fear the police uniform.

489
00:25:52,328 --> 00:25:54,162
Come, let's go.

490
00:25:54,413 --> 00:25:55,620
Let's go.
- Wait a minute.

491
00:25:56,037 --> 00:25:57,953
Listen.

492
00:25:58,245 --> 00:25:59,703
Run!

493
00:26:01,078 --> 00:26:02,403
Forgive me, sir.

494
00:26:02,493 --> 00:26:04,912
I don't know anything.
- Get the cot.

495
00:26:09,203 --> 00:26:10,787
I don't know anything.

496
00:26:10,953 --> 00:26:13,245
Come.
- Forgive me sir...

497
00:26:21,495 --> 00:26:22,620
Sit down.

498
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:26,120
Sir...

499
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:30,453
How did you get hurt?

500
00:27:21,493 --> 00:27:22,703
Please sit.

501
00:27:23,078 --> 00:27:24,780
Please sit.

502
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:26,287
Sit.

503
00:27:27,162 --> 00:27:28,495
Sit.

504
00:27:31,328 --> 00:27:32,995
You need not fear.

505
00:27:34,828 --> 00:27:35,912
I am Adil,

506
00:27:37,787 --> 00:27:38,953
your friend.

507
00:27:40,245 --> 00:27:42,245
I admit we've made mistakes.

508
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:44,995
The government did not pay
attention to your needs

509
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,745
and there has been injustice.

510
00:27:47,537 --> 00:27:49,578
Even today,

511
00:27:50,745 --> 00:27:51,912
you fear the police.

512
00:27:52,203 --> 00:27:53,787
I'm here to rid you of that fear.

513
00:27:54,745 --> 00:27:57,620
With your cooperation,
we can correct our mistakes.

514
00:27:58,578 --> 00:28:00,030
The government and the country

515
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,037
want you to be a part
of our progress.

516
00:28:02,828 --> 00:28:04,493
Your children should have
a bright future

517
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:07,578
and not live under the shadow
of terror and guns.

518
00:28:08,953 --> 00:28:10,403
Think for yourself.

519
00:28:10,493 --> 00:28:14,120
What good have the
Maoists done by giving you guns?

520
00:28:14,287 --> 00:28:16,280
Roads, electricity,
school, hospitals,

521
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:18,662
for which you took up arms

522
00:28:19,662 --> 00:28:21,453
did they give you all of that?

523
00:28:22,328 --> 00:28:23,495
Can they give them to you?

524
00:28:24,203 --> 00:28:27,245
The Naxals don't believe
in democracy.

525
00:28:28,245 --> 00:28:31,203
They want to capture power
through the barrel of the gun.

526
00:28:31,453 --> 00:28:34,912
And whoever gains power
through a gun,

527
00:28:35,162 --> 00:28:38,453
on what basis will they rule?

528
00:28:39,537 --> 00:28:40,912
You should think about that.

529
00:28:42,162 --> 00:28:44,078
This war has to stop now.

530
00:28:44,203 --> 00:28:45,578
It does no good to anyone.

531
00:28:46,953 --> 00:28:48,745
Stop living in fear

532
00:28:49,245 --> 00:28:51,995
and cooperate with us. Together we
can work towards a better society

533
00:28:52,493 --> 00:28:54,037
where no one can threaten you.

534
00:28:55,037 --> 00:28:55,995
No one.

535
00:28:58,413 --> 00:28:59,413
Here...

536
00:29:01,703 --> 00:29:03,745
If you have any problem

537
00:29:04,078 --> 00:29:06,370
or if anybody threatens you,

538
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:10,162
be it the Naxals or the police,

539
00:29:11,787 --> 00:29:13,030
this is my phone number.

540
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,203
Call me. I promise I will take
immediate action.

541
00:29:19,787 --> 00:29:21,162
Trust me.

542
00:29:23,745 --> 00:29:24,828
Trust me.

543
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,995
Everyone here is a member
of the party

544
00:29:30,078 --> 00:29:31,537
and you all have equal rights.

545
00:29:33,162 --> 00:29:34,203
What to do,

546
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,495
whom to listen to

547
00:29:37,287 --> 00:29:38,662
is your choice.

548
00:29:40,495 --> 00:29:42,072
All I can say is,

549
00:29:42,162 --> 00:29:44,703
what SP said here was a lie.

550
00:29:45,493 --> 00:29:48,370
They have been cheating you
for the past 60 years

551
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:51,745
with sweet talk and false promises.

552
00:29:52,287 --> 00:29:53,787
By feeding you a piece of candy,

553
00:29:54,953 --> 00:29:56,370
they will
suck the blood out of you.

554
00:29:56,912 --> 00:29:58,413
Don't forget, Comrades,

555
00:29:59,662 --> 00:30:01,870
these cops serve an
corrupt government.

556
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:05,328
Mahanta,
the owner of the Steel Project,

557
00:30:06,413 --> 00:30:07,703
where do you think he lives?

558
00:30:08,037 --> 00:30:09,578
He lives in London.

559
00:30:10,953 --> 00:30:12,953
His mansion is worth 15 billion.

560
00:30:13,203 --> 00:30:14,287
40 bedrooms,

561
00:30:14,493 --> 00:30:19,078
and a room each for eating,
bathing, dancing, and defecating.

562
00:30:20,662 --> 00:30:22,537
Swimming pool, golf course,

563
00:30:22,662 --> 00:30:24,703
God knows what else is there.

564
00:30:25,287 --> 00:30:26,995
Where does he get this kind
of money from?

565
00:30:28,995 --> 00:30:31,245
Tell me, from where?

566
00:30:31,995 --> 00:30:35,078
From the minerals lying
beneath this very land.

567
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:42,493
Mahanta has struck a 15 billion
deal with this government.

568
00:30:43,787 --> 00:30:45,870
How much?
- 15 billion!

569
00:30:46,245 --> 00:30:48,287
15 billion!

570
00:30:48,493 --> 00:30:50,037
Am I right, Balu?
- Yes, Comrade.

571
00:30:50,245 --> 00:30:52,370
Have you ever seen so much money?
- Yes Comrade,

572
00:30:52,493 --> 00:30:55,995
in my dreams.
Three bills of a billion each!

573
00:30:57,453 --> 00:30:58,870
What does Mahanta promise?

574
00:31:00,287 --> 00:31:03,662
He will open a first class
International University

575
00:31:04,537 --> 00:31:07,078
where our tribal children

576
00:31:07,203 --> 00:31:09,203
will learn to read
and talk in English.

577
00:31:09,328 --> 00:31:11,162
Shut up, you bloody fool.
- Shut up!

578
00:31:14,912 --> 00:31:18,953
This is a ploy to take our land
and displace us.

579
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:21,453
Will we be displaced?
- No!

580
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:23,078
We will never be displaced.

581
00:31:33,328 --> 00:31:34,453
'Hello.'

582
00:31:34,995 --> 00:31:35,822
'Hello.'

583
00:31:35,912 --> 00:31:37,245
Mobile.
- 'Hello.'

584
00:31:37,413 --> 00:31:38,703
'SP sir.'

585
00:31:38,828 --> 00:31:40,745
'SP sir? Hello?'

586
00:31:42,287 --> 00:31:43,447
Go.
- Yes.

587
00:31:43,537 --> 00:31:44,953
Hello? SP sir?

588
00:31:45,787 --> 00:31:47,030
SP sir.
- Hello.

589
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,245
'Hello.'
- Hello.

590
00:31:49,787 --> 00:31:51,370
SP sir.

591
00:31:51,493 --> 00:31:53,203
SP sir.

592
00:31:55,037 --> 00:31:56,787
You bastard!

593
00:31:57,037 --> 00:31:58,245
Come on!

594
00:31:58,995 --> 00:32:00,493
Come on!
- Come on!

595
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:02,953
You bastard!

596
00:32:04,493 --> 00:32:05,703
Give it.

597
00:32:11,703 --> 00:32:14,453
'Adil Khan'

598
00:32:21,413 --> 00:32:22,787
Hello?

599
00:32:23,287 --> 00:32:24,662
SP Adil Khan?

600
00:32:24,828 --> 00:32:25,787
Who is this?

601
00:32:26,413 --> 00:32:27,537
I'm Rajan.

602
00:32:28,328 --> 00:32:29,370
Rajan who?

603
00:32:29,493 --> 00:32:30,493
Listen to this

604
00:32:31,745 --> 00:32:33,078
and you will know.

605
00:32:49,995 --> 00:32:51,245
Listen.

606
00:32:52,493 --> 00:32:53,370
Rajan!

607
00:32:53,912 --> 00:32:56,120
Rajan, you bastard! Let him go.

608
00:32:56,537 --> 00:32:59,370
Why are you torturing a poor man?
If you're a man, come and face me.

609
00:32:59,493 --> 00:33:00,495
Shut up!

610
00:33:01,493 --> 00:33:03,453
Shut up!

611
00:33:03,662 --> 00:33:05,078
Don't mislead
our innocent villagers

612
00:33:05,203 --> 00:33:07,995
with your false promises.

613
00:33:08,413 --> 00:33:10,787
Don't dare to sneak into our
village again!

614
00:33:11,287 --> 00:33:12,620
If you want to live,

615
00:33:12,912 --> 00:33:14,953
stay in Nandighat town!

616
00:33:15,578 --> 00:33:16,413
Stay put there.

617
00:33:16,662 --> 00:33:17,953
Shut up!

618
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,828
The law of the
people's court is clear

619
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:26,287
on the punishment for betrayal.

620
00:33:27,037 --> 00:33:30,578
There's only one punishment
for giving information to police.

621
00:33:53,578 --> 00:33:55,453
Run!

622
00:34:02,253 --> 00:34:03,243
Sir.

623
00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:20,287
They killed my son, sir.

624
00:34:21,703 --> 00:34:23,495
Nobody will reveal anything, sir.

625
00:34:24,162 --> 00:34:26,370
Even if somebody puts
a thumb-print on the report,

626
00:34:26,662 --> 00:34:27,870
they will change their
statement in the court.

627
00:34:28,953 --> 00:34:31,078
It's impossible to win this
war by legal means.

628
00:34:32,745 --> 00:34:34,495
Rajaram, I want Rajan,

629
00:34:35,162 --> 00:34:36,537
at any cost.

630
00:34:47,745 --> 00:34:49,120
The same information here, too.

631
00:34:49,995 --> 00:34:52,037
Rajan had camped at
Latehar last night.

632
00:34:52,328 --> 00:34:54,287
He left this morning
at 10:00 via Kolhar.

633
00:34:54,662 --> 00:34:56,328
He's expected to cross
the border around 3:00 p.m.

634
00:34:56,495 --> 00:34:57,495
via Takroli lake.

635
00:34:58,162 --> 00:34:59,203
How many people are with him?

636
00:34:59,453 --> 00:35:00,745
Around 40-50 people, sir.

637
00:35:00,995 --> 00:35:02,238
Rajaram,
is the information foolproof?

638
00:35:02,328 --> 00:35:03,245
Sir, that...

639
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:08,870
I've put my life in danger
to reach you.

640
00:35:09,245 --> 00:35:11,620
If Rajan comes to know,
he will crucify me.

641
00:35:11,995 --> 00:35:12,953
Trust us.

642
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:28,537
You go that way.

643
00:35:28,662 --> 00:35:30,413
Rajaram, you go there.
- Okay, sir.

644
00:36:16,245 --> 00:36:17,370
No!

645
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:36,493
Sir!

646
00:36:51,787 --> 00:36:52,787
Let's go, sir!

647
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:55,078
Let's go, sir!

648
00:37:02,995 --> 00:37:05,120
Stay put in Nandighat, SP

649
00:37:05,662 --> 00:37:07,703
or I won't spare you!

650
00:37:08,578 --> 00:37:11,072
Lal Salam!
- Lal Salam!

651
00:37:11,162 --> 00:37:13,495
Lal Salam!
- Lal Salam!

652
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:15,162
Lal Salam!
- No.

653
00:37:15,413 --> 00:37:17,155
Lal Salam, Comrade.
- Yes.

654
00:37:17,245 --> 00:37:18,203
Well done.

655
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:44,662
Kabir?

656
00:37:46,578 --> 00:37:47,537
Are you crazy?

657
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:49,745
I could've shot you.

658
00:37:49,953 --> 00:37:51,453
My friend, this life is yours,

659
00:37:51,787 --> 00:37:52,912
take it anytime.

660
00:37:53,287 --> 00:37:54,953
Get me a drink first.

661
00:37:56,495 --> 00:37:58,078
Didn't the security stop you?

662
00:37:58,578 --> 00:38:00,155
Your security is so tight,

663
00:38:00,245 --> 00:38:01,493
I wouldn't have a chance
to come in.

664
00:38:01,662 --> 00:38:03,162
So, I came my own way.

665
00:38:03,453 --> 00:38:05,870
How'd the poor guys know
we're trained guerrilla fighters?

666
00:38:09,912 --> 00:38:11,203
You seem to be under great tension.

667
00:38:14,162 --> 00:38:15,703
Forget that, tell me

668
00:38:16,287 --> 00:38:18,495
what brings you here?
- What brings me here?

669
00:38:18,995 --> 00:38:19,953
I missed you,

670
00:38:20,953 --> 00:38:22,370
so came over to see you.

671
00:38:25,745 --> 00:38:27,037
Rhea told me about you.

672
00:38:28,328 --> 00:38:32,078
Heard you killed 8-10 Naxals.

673
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,620
I didn't.

674
00:38:41,537 --> 00:38:42,662
It was a trap.

675
00:38:45,328 --> 00:38:47,453
It was a bloody trap, Kabir.

676
00:38:47,953 --> 00:38:51,537
That bastard Rajan has created
a death-like terror here.

677
00:38:53,078 --> 00:38:56,745
He butchered poor Dagdu
and acts like a big hero.

678
00:38:58,287 --> 00:38:59,953
He got away today,

679
00:39:01,413 --> 00:39:02,995
but I'll hunt him down.

680
00:39:03,287 --> 00:39:06,495
I will hang his corpse from the
Home Minister's window.

681
00:39:07,493 --> 00:39:10,287
I'll clean up Nandighat.
What do those guys think?

682
00:39:12,078 --> 00:39:13,745
I am the police here.

683
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:16,495
I decide what is right and wrong.

684
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,493
If he has the guts,
let him face me.

685
00:39:21,995 --> 00:39:24,495
I challenge him man-to-man,
without any weapons.

686
00:39:25,828 --> 00:39:26,828
One-to-one!

687
00:39:27,287 --> 00:39:28,662
I'll smash the scoundrel!

688
00:39:28,787 --> 00:39:31,203
Okay, go to sleep now.

689
00:39:31,953 --> 00:39:33,162
Come on.

690
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:35,037
All I need is one reliable lead.

691
00:39:38,162 --> 00:39:40,328
I'll finish Rajan off.

692
00:39:40,493 --> 00:39:41,495
Go to sleep.

693
00:39:43,328 --> 00:39:44,828
I am glad you came.

694
00:39:46,493 --> 00:39:47,995
Everyone is scared.

695
00:39:52,453 --> 00:39:53,787
Everyone is scared.

696
00:40:04,787 --> 00:40:05,870
Adil.

697
00:40:06,953 --> 00:40:08,413
Adil.

698
00:40:10,995 --> 00:40:12,328
Haven't you slept yet?

699
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:14,787
I need to talk to you.

700
00:40:15,912 --> 00:40:16,912
Get up.

701
00:40:18,162 --> 00:40:19,745
Are you crazy?

702
00:40:20,078 --> 00:40:20,995
No,

703
00:40:21,245 --> 00:40:22,662
I have thought seriously about it.

704
00:40:23,037 --> 00:40:23,953
We can do it.

705
00:40:24,703 --> 00:40:25,662
If they have a doubt,

706
00:40:26,078 --> 00:40:27,370
they'll kill you in a second.

707
00:40:27,495 --> 00:40:29,703
How will they suspect?

708
00:40:29,995 --> 00:40:31,078
Nobody here knows me.

709
00:40:31,287 --> 00:40:32,578
Nobody has seen me here before.

710
00:40:32,703 --> 00:40:34,495
Neither locals nor Naxals,
not even your police.

711
00:40:34,953 --> 00:40:36,328
Once I get set with them,

712
00:40:36,453 --> 00:40:38,155
I'll send you all the information.

713
00:40:38,245 --> 00:40:39,780
Their plans, movements,

714
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:41,037
hideouts.

715
00:40:41,413 --> 00:40:44,072
You just keep attacking
and wipe them out. End of story.

716
00:40:44,162 --> 00:40:45,245
Kabir,

717
00:40:45,493 --> 00:40:48,037
your idea is totally stupid
and very dangerous.

718
00:40:48,493 --> 00:40:50,493
Danger from whom?

719
00:40:50,787 --> 00:40:52,370
I will be one of them,
their Comrade.

720
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:54,245
There's no question
of any suspicion.

721
00:40:55,662 --> 00:40:56,662
Adil,

722
00:40:56,870 --> 00:40:59,037
we have always worked
together as a team.

723
00:40:59,203 --> 00:41:00,745
No one could ever touch us.

724
00:41:02,113 --> 00:41:03,787
Trust me, man, we can do this.

725
00:41:04,245 --> 00:41:05,403
Kabir, you don't understand.

726
00:41:05,493 --> 00:41:06,495
Look,

727
00:41:06,662 --> 00:41:08,787
your conventional police
methods aren't working.

728
00:41:09,162 --> 00:41:10,453
You will have to do
something different.

729
00:41:12,493 --> 00:41:13,703
You want Rajan, right?

730
00:41:14,078 --> 00:41:15,245
I will give you Rajan.

731
00:41:15,787 --> 00:41:17,870
Trust me, we will win.

732
00:41:18,245 --> 00:41:20,120
You just figure out
a way for me to get in.

733
00:41:31,203 --> 00:41:32,413
Moti,

734
00:41:32,828 --> 00:41:33,988
have you switched sides?

735
00:41:34,078 --> 00:41:36,120
My shop is for the public.

736
00:41:36,413 --> 00:41:37,828
Can I refuse anyone?

737
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,620
It's been 7 days since
I put up the poster.

738
00:41:41,078 --> 00:41:42,493
You've not given any information.

739
00:41:42,662 --> 00:41:44,738
It's not easy to get any
information about the Naxalites.

740
00:41:44,828 --> 00:41:46,363
You have seen yourself that

741
00:41:46,453 --> 00:41:48,995
they take money
and give wrong information.

742
00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:50,995
Old woman,

743
00:41:51,287 --> 00:41:52,287
give me the money.

744
00:41:52,828 --> 00:41:56,328
Sir, I haven't sold anything yet.

745
00:41:56,453 --> 00:41:58,828
Shut up! Every week you give
the same excuse.

746
00:41:59,162 --> 00:42:01,703
I need to buy medicines, sir.

747
00:42:01,953 --> 00:42:03,787
My daughter is in the hospital.

748
00:42:03,912 --> 00:42:05,828
Let it go!

749
00:42:05,995 --> 00:42:07,413
You are a public servant.

750
00:42:07,662 --> 00:42:08,953
This doesn't suit you.
- Hey!

751
00:42:09,245 --> 00:42:11,078
How dare you touch a cop?

752
00:42:11,245 --> 00:42:13,162
How dare you touch a cop?

753
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:21,662
Thrash him!

754
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:25,995
Catch him!

755
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,745
Catch him!

756
00:42:31,493 --> 00:42:33,287
Come to the police station.

757
00:42:33,413 --> 00:42:35,328
I will teach you a lesson.

758
00:42:48,162 --> 00:42:49,370
Take him along.

759
00:42:49,493 --> 00:42:50,828
Move!

760
00:42:53,078 --> 00:42:54,453
'Police station'

761
00:42:54,995 --> 00:42:56,495
53!

762
00:42:56,703 --> 00:42:58,072
419!

763
00:42:58,162 --> 00:42:59,287
420!

764
00:42:59,495 --> 00:43:00,995
468!

765
00:43:03,037 --> 00:43:04,413
You scoundrel!

766
00:43:10,787 --> 00:43:13,162
Which Naxal unit do you belong to?

767
00:43:13,912 --> 00:43:16,370
How many times must I say
I am not a Naxal?

768
00:43:16,578 --> 00:43:17,912
I came to collect
my outstanding dues.

769
00:43:18,078 --> 00:43:20,493
Give that story to someone else.

770
00:43:20,828 --> 00:43:22,787
I'll write your story.

771
00:43:23,287 --> 00:43:24,363
You scoundrel,

772
00:43:24,453 --> 00:43:27,745
I'll charge you on so many counts
that you'll forget counting.

773
00:43:36,078 --> 00:43:36,995
Madhav!

774
00:43:41,578 --> 00:43:42,745
I'll deal with this.

775
00:43:45,703 --> 00:43:48,203
You take care of your nose.
I think it's broken.

776
00:43:49,078 --> 00:43:50,280
You!
- Come on!

777
00:43:50,370 --> 00:43:52,203
Settle your score tomorrow.

778
00:43:52,413 --> 00:43:54,203
He isn't going anywhere.

779
00:43:54,578 --> 00:43:55,620
Go.

780
00:43:57,828 --> 00:43:59,120
Leave him.

781
00:43:59,495 --> 00:44:01,203
Do you want to hit me too, SP?

782
00:44:01,745 --> 00:44:02,953
Come on, hit me.

783
00:44:03,245 --> 00:44:05,953
But remember,
I won't spare anybody.

784
00:44:08,537 --> 00:44:10,287
Solitary lock-up for him.

785
00:44:10,745 --> 00:44:13,493
He speaks a lot.

786
00:44:16,078 --> 00:44:17,828
Let him rot!

787
00:44:32,662 --> 00:44:34,912
The rascal escaped!
- Catch him.

788
00:44:48,662 --> 00:44:51,203
'After escaping from the lock-up
run straight into the jungle.'

789
00:44:52,495 --> 00:44:53,328
'Don't be afraid.'

790
00:44:53,493 --> 00:44:56,203
'The cops won't follow you
into the jungle at night.'

791
00:45:07,537 --> 00:45:09,162
'The jungle is Naxal area.'

792
00:45:09,787 --> 00:45:11,120
'They will find you.'

793
00:45:12,037 --> 00:45:13,078
'Remember,'

794
00:45:13,912 --> 00:45:16,620
'they suspect every stranger
of being a police informer.'

795
00:45:36,662 --> 00:45:37,995
Hey!

796
00:45:38,370 --> 00:45:39,453
Hey!

797
00:45:40,413 --> 00:45:41,493
Get up!

798
00:46:10,870 --> 00:46:12,162
You can leave.

799
00:46:13,537 --> 00:46:15,037
He's in our custody now.

800
00:46:21,245 --> 00:46:22,493
Who are you people?

801
00:46:23,495 --> 00:46:24,363
Get him up.

802
00:46:24,453 --> 00:46:25,870
Catch him!
- What are you doing?

803
00:46:25,995 --> 00:46:27,078
Tie him!

804
00:46:27,328 --> 00:46:28,413
Where are you taking me?

805
00:46:28,537 --> 00:46:30,537
Where are you taking me?
- Get up.

806
00:46:31,078 --> 00:46:31,995
Come on!

807
00:46:53,828 --> 00:46:55,620
Sit here.

808
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:57,745
Sit.

809
00:47:02,703 --> 00:47:03,828
What's your name?

810
00:47:05,953 --> 00:47:07,370
What's your name?

811
00:47:08,245 --> 00:47:09,162
Kabir.

812
00:47:09,370 --> 00:47:11,162
Full name! Kabir what?

813
00:47:12,413 --> 00:47:13,453
What's it to you?

814
00:47:14,245 --> 00:47:15,493
Are you a cop?

815
00:47:16,245 --> 00:47:17,912
You are the cop.

816
00:47:18,995 --> 00:47:20,287
What do you think?

817
00:47:20,662 --> 00:47:22,912
Just because we live in the jungle,
we are fools?

818
00:47:23,453 --> 00:47:24,613
What?

819
00:47:24,703 --> 00:47:25,828
Hey,

820
00:47:26,078 --> 00:47:28,787
we know you're SP Adil Khan's man.

821
00:47:31,287 --> 00:47:32,745
You're right.

822
00:47:33,703 --> 00:47:36,413
I know you're Madhuri Dixit.

823
00:47:37,287 --> 00:47:38,537
Hey!

824
00:47:39,037 --> 00:47:41,870
We are not playing games.

825
00:47:44,037 --> 00:47:47,745
In a second this bullet
will rip through your skull.

826
00:47:48,078 --> 00:47:49,620
Why are you asking such questions?

827
00:47:50,245 --> 00:47:52,078
You brought me blind-folded here

828
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:54,620
and then insult me
by calling me a cop.

829
00:47:59,078 --> 00:48:00,537
You're not from here.

830
00:48:01,703 --> 00:48:03,370
What are you doing in Nandighat?

831
00:48:04,203 --> 00:48:05,662
I had a business in Nagpur,

832
00:48:06,078 --> 00:48:07,578
manufacturing mobiles.

833
00:48:08,413 --> 00:48:09,703
It didn't work out,

834
00:48:10,203 --> 00:48:11,745
and people here owed me money.

835
00:48:12,413 --> 00:48:13,745
I came here to collect my dues.

836
00:48:14,828 --> 00:48:16,197
I heard his shop had shut.

837
00:48:16,287 --> 00:48:17,370
Which one?

838
00:48:18,245 --> 00:48:19,703
Shri Computers.

839
00:48:21,537 --> 00:48:23,745
He sells second hand mobile phones

840
00:48:24,370 --> 00:48:25,495
at Hanuman Chowk.

841
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:27,912
What?

842
00:48:28,245 --> 00:48:30,203
Is it prohibited to
collect your dues?

843
00:48:31,078 --> 00:48:32,413
Will you shoot me for that?

844
00:48:33,745 --> 00:48:35,078
Stand him up.

845
00:48:41,495 --> 00:48:44,078
"That dawn."

846
00:48:44,413 --> 00:48:46,662
"That dawn."

847
00:48:46,995 --> 00:48:51,578
"That dawn will surely
come one day."

848
00:48:52,912 --> 00:48:54,537
"That dawn"

849
00:48:54,870 --> 00:48:59,037
"will surely come one day."

850
00:48:59,370 --> 00:49:01,287
"That dawn,"

851
00:49:01,745 --> 00:49:06,203
"wait for it."
- He's so melodramatic.

852
00:49:06,745 --> 00:49:08,245
I cross checked
with Shri Computers.

853
00:49:08,370 --> 00:49:10,078
What he said is true.

854
00:49:10,537 --> 00:49:12,453
And the police?
- They're hunting for him.

855
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:14,453
They've charged him with 7-8 cases.

856
00:49:21,828 --> 00:49:23,162
Untie him.

857
00:49:24,703 --> 00:49:25,912
I get it now.

858
00:49:26,537 --> 00:49:27,995
You are not humans,

859
00:49:28,413 --> 00:49:29,620
but you are Naxals.

860
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:32,162
Please forgive me.

861
00:49:32,578 --> 00:49:33,870
I came to the wrong place.

862
00:49:34,828 --> 00:49:36,912
It's okay if I don't recover
my money.

863
00:49:37,493 --> 00:49:38,995
Radio, TV,

864
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:40,780
I'll make something else.

865
00:49:40,870 --> 00:49:42,328
You can go if you want,

866
00:49:43,578 --> 00:49:45,787
but the police will frame you.

867
00:49:47,203 --> 00:49:49,203
They'll give you the
title of a Naxalite too.

868
00:49:51,537 --> 00:49:54,620
I heard you broke
Madhav Rao's nose.

869
00:49:57,078 --> 00:49:58,493
They had caught me

870
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:00,413
if not, I would have...

871
00:50:01,578 --> 00:50:02,787
Let's go.

872
00:50:03,453 --> 00:50:04,403
Hey?

873
00:50:04,493 --> 00:50:06,245
Where are you going
leaving me here?

874
00:50:06,537 --> 00:50:07,578
What do you expect us to do?

875
00:50:07,912 --> 00:50:09,280
We can't keep you with us.

876
00:50:09,370 --> 00:50:11,370
Why did you capture me?

877
00:50:12,078 --> 00:50:13,245
You just said

878
00:50:13,495 --> 00:50:15,912
if the cops find me they'll
kill me, labelling me a Naxal.

879
00:50:17,037 --> 00:50:19,120
You've left me with no option.

880
00:50:22,995 --> 00:50:24,287
What he says is true.

881
00:50:24,953 --> 00:50:25,870
Comrade,

882
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:28,328
we don't know his politics.

883
00:50:28,828 --> 00:50:30,203
He could also be a criminal.

884
00:50:30,578 --> 00:50:32,578
What politics, Comrade?

885
00:50:32,912 --> 00:50:34,745
An enemy's enemy
is always a friend.

886
00:50:35,537 --> 00:50:37,578
He seems a useful man.

887
00:50:38,453 --> 00:50:39,787
He sings well.

888
00:50:39,912 --> 00:50:42,037
He was singing all night.

889
00:50:45,453 --> 00:50:47,493
Alright, put him with the
theatre group.

890
00:50:48,370 --> 00:50:49,530
He'll be useful for the campaign.

891
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:55,578
"We've had enough of
your autocratic rule."

892
00:50:56,912 --> 00:51:00,912
"It is our turn now."

893
00:51:11,787 --> 00:51:16,370
"The inflation has doused
our kitchen fires."

894
00:51:17,078 --> 00:51:21,328
"They set out to remove poverty.
Instead, got rid of the poor."

895
00:51:21,662 --> 00:51:24,120
"Like sipping sweet lemonade..."

896
00:51:24,328 --> 00:51:28,787
"Like sipping sweet lemonade they
swallow the country in a gulp."

897
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:33,620
"The common man's pocket
is cleaned out bare."

898
00:51:33,953 --> 00:51:38,488
"Like sipping sweet lemonade they
swallow the country in a gulp."

899
00:51:38,578 --> 00:51:43,328
"The common man's pocket
is cleaned out bare."

900
00:51:43,493 --> 00:51:47,905
"The common man's pocket
is cleaned out bare."

901
00:51:47,995 --> 00:51:52,328
"We've had enough of your
autocratic rule."

902
00:51:52,493 --> 00:51:54,995
"It is our turn now."

903
00:51:55,328 --> 00:51:59,495
"We've had enough of your
autocratic rule."

904
00:51:59,745 --> 00:52:02,995
"It is our turn now."

905
00:52:27,745 --> 00:52:32,328
"Be it Birla or Tata,
Ambani or Bata."

906
00:52:32,493 --> 00:52:37,162
"For their selfish motives,
they've carved up the country."

907
00:52:37,370 --> 00:52:41,870
"Be it Birla or Tata,
Ambani or Bata."

908
00:52:42,203 --> 00:52:46,488
"For their selfish motives,
they've carved up the country."

909
00:52:46,578 --> 00:52:51,245
"It is our blood"

910
00:52:51,370 --> 00:52:53,745
"that drives their engines,
fast and furious."

911
00:52:53,870 --> 00:52:58,328
"The common man's pocket
is cleaned out bare."

912
00:52:58,493 --> 00:53:03,162
"The common man's pocket
is cleaned out bare."

913
00:53:03,287 --> 00:53:07,655
"We won't bear it anymore."

914
00:53:07,745 --> 00:53:10,245
"It is our turn now."

915
00:53:10,413 --> 00:53:14,912
"We won't bear it anymore."

916
00:53:15,037 --> 00:53:17,995
"It is our turn now."

917
00:53:18,370 --> 00:53:20,113
Madhav, go through the
entire district and enquire.

918
00:53:20,203 --> 00:53:21,738
I will check personally.
- Sir!

919
00:53:21,828 --> 00:53:23,203
'101.'

920
00:53:25,287 --> 00:53:26,203
Sir!

921
00:53:26,495 --> 00:53:27,738
He's the same Naxalite.

922
00:53:27,828 --> 00:53:29,287
I told you.

923
00:53:29,745 --> 00:53:31,537
I won't spare him today.
- Arrest him.

924
00:53:31,870 --> 00:53:32,870
Give me the wireless.

925
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:35,530
Come in, patrol party...

926
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:36,828
Sir, phone call from
the headquarters.

927
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:38,662
Here, sir.

928
00:53:40,787 --> 00:53:41,572
Yes, sir.

929
00:53:41,662 --> 00:53:43,493
Get him. He's a Naxal.
- Yes, sir.

930
00:53:44,370 --> 00:53:45,697
They are from the Theatre Group.

931
00:53:45,787 --> 00:53:48,203
Arrest the man
playing the harmonium!

932
00:53:49,078 --> 00:53:50,495
I will check, sir.

933
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:52,912
I'll check, sir.
Come on.

934
00:53:53,453 --> 00:53:54,703
Sir.

935
00:53:55,328 --> 00:53:56,405
Yes, sir.

936
00:53:56,495 --> 00:54:01,370
"Come on, brother, play the drums!"

937
00:54:01,493 --> 00:54:06,120
"Come on, brother, play the drums!"
- Move aside.

938
00:54:20,245 --> 00:54:21,363
'To gain their trust,'

939
00:54:21,453 --> 00:54:23,828
'you will have to feed them
information about us.'

940
00:54:24,493 --> 00:54:28,162
'Monday morning,
I'll patrol Jhingna and Ratonwadi.'

941
00:54:29,162 --> 00:54:33,370
'And the wireless frequency on
Monday mornings will be 132.5.'

942
00:54:57,493 --> 00:54:59,245
Where are you running like insane?

943
00:54:59,493 --> 00:55:01,323
Five police contingents
are heading to Jhingna.

944
00:55:01,413 --> 00:55:02,370
We have to move at once.

945
00:55:02,493 --> 00:55:03,787
How do you know?

946
00:55:04,078 --> 00:55:06,287
Through the radio. Stop questioning
so we can leave?

947
00:55:06,413 --> 00:55:07,787
Stop this nonsense!

948
00:55:08,453 --> 00:55:10,328
Do the cops announce their
plans on the radio now?

949
00:55:10,453 --> 00:55:11,537
Didi!

950
00:55:16,037 --> 00:55:18,120
Didi, there's a message
from Ratonwadi.

951
00:55:18,453 --> 00:55:19,828
The enemy is reaching Jhingna!

952
00:55:29,287 --> 00:55:30,495
And, when I told you?

953
00:55:31,370 --> 00:55:33,370
You get ready to hit me
for every little thing.

954
00:55:33,745 --> 00:55:34,912
Run from here.

955
00:55:35,870 --> 00:55:37,162
Inform Comrade Rajan immediately.

956
00:55:37,413 --> 00:55:38,787
We'll wait for him at Motireta.

957
00:55:45,995 --> 00:55:47,413
Lal Salam!
- Lal Salam!

958
00:55:47,537 --> 00:55:48,953
Lal Salam!

959
00:55:50,037 --> 00:55:51,120
Who is he?

960
00:55:52,828 --> 00:55:53,953
This is Kabir, Comrade.

961
00:55:54,328 --> 00:55:55,370
Kabir?

962
00:55:56,287 --> 00:55:58,493
Is it him?

963
00:55:59,078 --> 00:56:01,078
The one who broke
Madhav Rao's nose.

964
00:56:02,413 --> 00:56:04,662
He intercepted the police
talk on the radio!

965
00:56:05,578 --> 00:56:06,953
The radio?

966
00:56:13,537 --> 00:56:14,537
Just a minute.

967
00:56:23,787 --> 00:56:25,072
'We are patrolling in Jhingna,
sir.'

968
00:56:25,162 --> 00:56:26,787
'We haven't found
any truck here. Over.'

969
00:56:27,662 --> 00:56:29,787
'We are heading
in your direction. Over.'

970
00:56:30,453 --> 00:56:33,030
'We will need more men, sir.'

971
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:34,203
'Over.'

972
00:56:36,162 --> 00:56:37,280
'Continue your paroling.'

973
00:56:37,370 --> 00:56:38,870
Well done, Comrade.
- 'Over.'

974
00:56:39,203 --> 00:56:40,578
Where did you learn all this?

975
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:41,863
'Give updates. Over.'

976
00:56:41,953 --> 00:56:42,995
I'm a B.Tech engineer, Comrade.

977
00:56:43,787 --> 00:56:45,488
Moreover, I'm interested
in such things.

978
00:56:45,578 --> 00:56:47,870
"March carefully, or you will die."

979
00:56:48,245 --> 00:56:49,203
Keshav,

980
00:56:49,495 --> 00:56:50,828
keep him with you.

981
00:56:58,037 --> 00:56:59,203
Are they new recruits?

982
00:56:59,745 --> 00:57:00,995
Those are the new recruits,

983
00:57:01,537 --> 00:57:03,578
their training has just begun.
- Okay.

984
00:57:03,703 --> 00:57:04,822
16!
- 17!

985
00:57:04,912 --> 00:57:05,947
18!
- 19!

986
00:57:06,037 --> 00:57:07,245
20!
- 21!

987
00:57:07,493 --> 00:57:08,493
Number 21!

988
00:57:08,870 --> 00:57:10,495
Start from 1 again.
- Why?

989
00:57:11,245 --> 00:57:12,787
Why 1 after 20?

990
00:57:13,287 --> 00:57:16,370
Because our tribals
can't count beyond 20.

991
00:57:18,328 --> 00:57:19,537
Amazing.

992
00:57:19,787 --> 00:57:21,495
They can't count beyond 20,

993
00:57:22,370 --> 00:57:24,328
but they know everything
about politics, revolution,

994
00:57:24,828 --> 00:57:26,370
Mao, Lenin.

995
00:57:26,870 --> 00:57:28,238
Very good. One!

996
00:57:28,328 --> 00:57:31,413
'No obstruction in putting up the
Mahanta steel plant', says the PM.

997
00:57:31,620 --> 00:57:32,493
See,

998
00:57:33,245 --> 00:57:35,328
don't take this Adil Khan lightly.

999
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:38,537
They've posted a senior officer
like him here

1000
00:57:39,287 --> 00:57:41,995
because they intend to use all
their force for this project.

1001
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:44,912
Wherever Mahanta
set up such plants,

1002
00:57:46,162 --> 00:57:48,578
Indonesia, Brazil, Libya,

1003
00:57:49,828 --> 00:57:52,162
he has funded private armies

1004
00:57:52,620 --> 00:57:54,578
to displace the locals.

1005
00:57:55,203 --> 00:57:57,287
The politicians are making
a lot of noise here too.

1006
00:57:57,662 --> 00:57:59,787
Tell the Central Committee

1007
00:58:00,203 --> 00:58:01,912
to prepare for direct action.

1008
00:58:03,078 --> 00:58:04,403
We'll hold a training camp

1009
00:58:04,493 --> 00:58:07,495
and train the militia
and comrades in weapons.

1010
00:58:08,370 --> 00:58:11,037
Done.
- But we need funds to buy arms.

1011
00:58:12,328 --> 00:58:13,495
We don't have enough.

1012
00:58:15,828 --> 00:58:17,120
Why are you looking at me?

1013
00:58:17,578 --> 00:58:19,413
Your accounts are bad, Comrade.

1014
00:58:21,413 --> 00:58:23,030
What are you saying?

1015
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:26,703
Comrade Naga,
in the past three months,

1016
00:58:27,453 --> 00:58:31,328
you've collected 25
from Road Contractors,

1017
00:58:32,037 --> 00:58:34,155
22 from the Bamboo guys

1018
00:58:34,245 --> 00:58:37,162
and 20 from Cosmos...
- What is this 25, 22 and 20?

1019
00:58:37,453 --> 00:58:39,537
I do the collections
and you are keeping an account?

1020
00:58:40,703 --> 00:58:43,745
Comrade Rajan,
you're being misled.

1021
00:58:43,995 --> 00:58:46,370
Whatever I collect,

1022
00:58:46,493 --> 00:58:47,863
I deposit every single penny.

1023
00:58:47,953 --> 00:58:49,787
You have to prove the account.

1024
00:58:51,453 --> 00:58:53,870
You can't talk to me like this.

1025
00:58:54,328 --> 00:58:55,238
I am an area commander.

1026
00:58:55,328 --> 00:58:57,203
I've given my blood for the party...
- Sit down, Naga!

1027
00:59:01,162 --> 00:59:02,453
Sit.

1028
00:59:08,537 --> 00:59:09,613
Control yourself.

1029
00:59:09,703 --> 00:59:10,947
We're talking about accounts.

1030
00:59:11,037 --> 00:59:12,495
My accounts are clear.

1031
00:59:12,828 --> 00:59:14,905
SP Adil Khan has made
things very tough

1032
00:59:14,995 --> 00:59:17,078
and yet if the party needs
more funds, I can still do it.

1033
00:59:18,078 --> 00:59:19,995
Stop putting
false allegations on me.

1034
00:59:22,870 --> 00:59:24,870
Leave money matters to me.

1035
00:59:25,995 --> 00:59:28,537
I'll organise the funds.

1036
00:59:32,537 --> 00:59:33,905
Inform the supplier

1037
00:59:33,995 --> 00:59:35,578
that the arms must be
delivered on time.

1038
00:59:37,203 --> 00:59:38,370
Soon.

1039
00:59:42,995 --> 00:59:44,745
Lal Salam, Comrade.
- Lal Salam.

1040
00:59:46,370 --> 00:59:47,323
Be careful, Comrade.

1041
00:59:47,413 --> 00:59:48,413
110 automatic,

1042
00:59:48,578 --> 00:59:49,613
500 kgs of explosives,

1043
00:59:49,703 --> 00:59:51,245
gun powder and 25 AK 47.

1044
00:59:51,537 --> 00:59:52,405
They are in 4 boxes.

1045
00:59:52,495 --> 00:59:53,703
Come on.

1046
01:00:52,328 --> 01:00:53,370
Hurry up.

1047
01:00:54,413 --> 01:00:55,662
I'll do it.

1048
01:01:00,037 --> 01:01:01,328
Why are we leaving them here?

1049
01:01:01,745 --> 01:01:03,120
Here the forest is not dense

1050
01:01:03,245 --> 01:01:05,078
and the police patrolling
has increased.

1051
01:01:05,328 --> 01:01:06,745
It is dangerous to carry it back.

1052
01:01:07,703 --> 01:01:10,120
Very soon Comrade Shivram
will organise a training camp here.

1053
01:01:10,287 --> 01:01:11,370
We'll take it then.

1054
01:01:11,745 --> 01:01:12,863
Go with Kabir

1055
01:01:12,953 --> 01:01:14,155
and buy some vegetables
and spices.

1056
01:01:14,245 --> 01:01:15,370
I'll meet you at the bus stop.

1057
01:01:15,703 --> 01:01:16,822
We'll buy it from here.

1058
01:01:16,912 --> 01:01:18,245
Please come.
- How much for tomatoes?

1059
01:01:19,537 --> 01:01:20,745
Rs 12.

1060
01:01:21,620 --> 01:01:23,162
We just need this much.

1061
01:01:23,287 --> 01:01:28,745
"The flower has blossomed
in the garden."

1062
01:01:31,162 --> 01:01:35,905
"My bangles are jingling."

1063
01:01:35,995 --> 01:01:39,120
"My bangles are jingling."

1064
01:01:41,287 --> 01:01:44,655
"Like in the river..."

1065
01:01:44,745 --> 01:01:47,280
I'm telling you, not now.
I'll call you later.

1066
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:50,662
"Like the boat flows on water."

1067
01:01:51,870 --> 01:01:54,370
Rs 5!

1068
01:01:54,745 --> 01:01:56,287
Come on, just Rs 5!

1069
01:02:12,328 --> 01:02:14,495
Hello? Yes.

1070
01:02:15,370 --> 01:02:17,493
The bus is running late,
will be there in 10-15 minutes.

1071
01:02:18,245 --> 01:02:20,245
I will be there soon.

1072
01:02:23,787 --> 01:02:25,287
Is Juhi your real name?

1073
01:02:27,328 --> 01:02:29,493
Everyone here has many names.

1074
01:02:29,870 --> 01:02:31,662
I don't know if your
name is Juhi or not.

1075
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:36,662
That's not my real name.

1076
01:02:37,537 --> 01:02:39,037
It's the name given by the party.

1077
01:02:41,662 --> 01:02:43,493
I don't even remember
my real name anymore.

1078
01:02:44,745 --> 01:02:46,203
It's been 9 years
since I left home.

1079
01:02:47,203 --> 01:02:48,453
What happened?

1080
01:02:52,078 --> 01:02:53,537
I am from Jharkhand.

1081
01:02:56,078 --> 01:02:57,787
My father wanted to educate me,

1082
01:02:59,078 --> 01:03:00,703
but destiny had different plans.

1083
01:03:03,203 --> 01:03:05,370
My dad had borrowed
some money on interest.

1084
01:03:07,828 --> 01:03:10,162
Those people
first took my two sisters away

1085
01:03:11,662 --> 01:03:13,078
and then seized our land.

1086
01:03:16,453 --> 01:03:18,493
When I went to the police station
to file a complaint,

1087
01:03:19,078 --> 01:03:20,537
the cop said,
'Come home at night'.

1088
01:03:21,537 --> 01:03:23,328
'I'll file your complaint then'.

1089
01:03:23,578 --> 01:03:25,245
Then I decided.

1090
01:03:29,745 --> 01:03:31,203
I don't care now.

1091
01:03:32,162 --> 01:03:34,370
My mission is to establish
the people's government.

1092
01:03:35,703 --> 01:03:37,370
If I live for another 10 years,

1093
01:03:37,953 --> 01:03:39,662
I will kill at least a 100 more.

1094
01:03:59,662 --> 01:04:01,495
Kabir...

1095
01:04:02,245 --> 01:04:03,870
It's time for your shift.

1096
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:39,620
'Hello?'
- It's me, Kabir. Can you hear me?

1097
01:04:40,037 --> 01:04:41,078
Kabir?

1098
01:04:41,620 --> 01:04:43,120
How are you?
Where are you calling from?

1099
01:04:43,245 --> 01:04:45,578
From the camp.
I've joined them, Comrade.

1100
01:04:45,995 --> 01:04:47,870
I thought you'd just
continue with the singing.

1101
01:04:48,245 --> 01:04:49,447
I had to do it.

1102
01:04:49,537 --> 01:04:51,912
Now listen, a big consignment
of arms has arrived.

1103
01:04:52,912 --> 01:04:54,162
I'll send the location.

1104
01:04:54,787 --> 01:04:56,493
A training camp
is also going to be held.

1105
01:04:56,953 --> 01:04:58,953
'Will send the details as soon as
I know.' - When?

1106
01:04:59,370 --> 01:05:00,493
When I get to know.

1107
01:05:00,703 --> 01:05:02,870
Break the mobile phone
once you send the location. Get it?

1108
01:05:03,370 --> 01:05:05,912
'And take care.'
- Yes, okay. Bye.

1109
01:05:22,703 --> 01:05:24,120
What are you doing?

1110
01:05:25,662 --> 01:05:27,203
Who are you messaging?

1111
01:05:28,493 --> 01:05:29,787
Give it to me.

1112
01:06:17,328 --> 01:06:19,613
More than 500 Comrades
have registered this time.

1113
01:06:19,703 --> 01:06:21,662
We don't have enough weapons.
- Yes.

1114
01:06:21,870 --> 01:06:23,162
So, train them well.

1115
01:06:23,287 --> 01:06:24,245
Sir!

1116
01:06:24,995 --> 01:06:26,162
One, two, one!

1117
01:06:26,493 --> 01:06:27,662
One, two, one!

1118
01:06:30,413 --> 01:06:31,953
There was a police raid
this morning.

1119
01:06:32,162 --> 01:06:34,287
One, two, one!

1120
01:06:34,703 --> 01:06:35,863
One, two, one!

1121
01:06:35,953 --> 01:06:37,620
One, two, one!
- Come here.

1122
01:06:40,245 --> 01:06:41,453
Everyone got trapped.

1123
01:06:41,620 --> 01:06:43,370
Everything is over.
- What are you saying?

1124
01:06:43,828 --> 01:06:45,280
Enemies seized the weapons.

1125
01:06:45,370 --> 01:06:46,745
One, two, one!

1126
01:06:47,078 --> 01:06:48,488
Nothing is left.

1127
01:06:48,578 --> 01:06:50,203
One, two, one!

1128
01:06:50,328 --> 01:06:51,537
One, two, one!

1129
01:06:53,662 --> 01:06:55,120
One, two, one!

1130
01:06:55,287 --> 01:06:56,493
One, two, one!

1131
01:06:56,953 --> 01:06:58,447
One, two, one!

1132
01:06:58,537 --> 01:07:00,155
One, two, one!

1133
01:07:00,245 --> 01:07:01,780
One, two, one!

1134
01:07:01,870 --> 01:07:03,403
One, two, one!

1135
01:07:03,493 --> 01:07:05,072
One, two, one!

1136
01:07:05,162 --> 01:07:06,287
Where is Keshav?

1137
01:07:06,662 --> 01:07:07,787
I didn't see him on my shift.

1138
01:07:08,245 --> 01:07:09,870
One, two, one!
- Even I didn't see him.

1139
01:07:10,078 --> 01:07:11,203
One, two, one!

1140
01:07:11,328 --> 01:07:12,493
One, two, one!

1141
01:07:12,828 --> 01:07:14,738
One, two, one!

1142
01:07:14,828 --> 01:07:16,745
He ruined everything!

1143
01:07:19,078 --> 01:07:20,662
110 automatic,

1144
01:07:20,787 --> 01:07:22,495
500 kgs of explosives,

1145
01:07:22,745 --> 01:07:24,828
gun powder, and 25 AK 47.

1146
01:07:25,620 --> 01:07:27,787
Their plan was to distribute
these arms to the villagers.

1147
01:07:28,245 --> 01:07:29,828
The Maoists are getting desperate.

1148
01:07:30,370 --> 01:07:32,870
But our intelligence
is watching their every move

1149
01:07:33,370 --> 01:07:35,370
and we'll never let them
succeed in their plans.

1150
01:07:36,620 --> 01:07:37,828
We have complete information about

1151
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:40,245
their supplier and the source.

1152
01:07:41,662 --> 01:07:44,403
Adil Khan can try his best,

1153
01:07:44,493 --> 01:07:46,953
death cannot move us.

1154
01:07:47,245 --> 01:07:49,413
These incidents won't bother us.

1155
01:07:49,870 --> 01:07:53,078
Our movement is for the people.

1156
01:07:54,413 --> 01:07:57,953
For their rights, we will fight
until our last breath.

1157
01:07:58,620 --> 01:08:02,870
Until we don't uproot them
from every inch of our land,

1158
01:08:04,203 --> 01:08:05,828
we will not rest in peace.

1159
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:09,620
The people's training camps

1160
01:08:10,370 --> 01:08:11,787
will continue until then.

1161
01:08:12,493 --> 01:08:15,197
Lal Salam!
- Lal Salam!

1162
01:08:15,287 --> 01:08:19,863
"We will snatch our right."

1163
01:08:19,953 --> 01:08:21,988
We will snatch our right.

1164
01:08:22,078 --> 01:08:28,870
"There's no doubt about it."

1165
01:08:43,662 --> 01:08:46,113
"This forest is our father."

1166
01:08:46,203 --> 01:08:48,780
"The river is our mother."

1167
01:08:48,870 --> 01:08:51,403
"If anyone snatch these,"

1168
01:08:51,493 --> 01:08:53,995
"we'll rip them apart."

1169
01:09:10,787 --> 01:09:11,662
Juhi!

1170
01:09:29,037 --> 01:09:32,323
"We will not listen to anyone.
We will not bear it anymore."

1171
01:09:32,413 --> 01:09:35,947
"We've heard enough.
We've suffered enough."

1172
01:09:36,037 --> 01:09:39,403
"How long should we keep mum?"

1173
01:09:39,493 --> 01:09:42,947
"One day, we shall speak!"

1174
01:09:43,037 --> 01:09:45,493
"He demands..."

1175
01:09:46,037 --> 01:09:51,488
"This new man demands
the right to live."

1176
01:09:51,578 --> 01:09:54,323
"When he didn't get it,"

1177
01:09:54,413 --> 01:09:56,870
"he took weapons in his hands."

1178
01:10:25,078 --> 01:10:30,287
"When he didn't get it,
he took weapons in his hands."

1179
01:10:31,413 --> 01:10:37,078
"When he didn't get it,
he took weapons in his hands."

1180
01:10:37,828 --> 01:10:43,413
"When he didn't get it,
he took weapons in his hands."

1181
01:10:44,328 --> 01:10:49,995
"When he didn't get it,
he took weapons in his hands."

1182
01:11:01,253 --> 01:11:04,403
"You're a cloud
with rage filled in it."

1183
01:11:04,493 --> 01:11:07,537
"I'm a mountain,
standing in your path."

1184
01:11:07,662 --> 01:11:10,738
"If you mess with me,"

1185
01:11:10,828 --> 01:11:14,238
"there will be a shower of sweat."

1186
01:11:14,328 --> 01:11:16,703
"It becomes rain."

1187
01:11:17,493 --> 01:11:20,245
"It became a strange night."

1188
01:11:20,703 --> 01:11:22,323
"It becomes rain."

1189
01:11:22,413 --> 01:11:23,863
"It became a strange night."

1190
01:11:23,953 --> 01:11:26,703
"Once you break free..."

1191
01:11:29,870 --> 01:11:34,203
"Once you break free..."
- The police have attacked!

1192
01:12:00,787 --> 01:12:02,120
Fire!

1193
01:12:09,245 --> 01:12:10,578
'Red revolution'

1194
01:12:25,870 --> 01:12:27,413
Leave!

1195
01:12:38,537 --> 01:12:41,162
Come Juhi, let's go.

1196
01:12:41,828 --> 01:12:43,745
Juhi, let's leave. Hurry up!

1197
01:12:48,745 --> 01:12:50,578
Attack!

1198
01:13:19,493 --> 01:13:20,578
Stop!

1199
01:13:25,662 --> 01:13:28,403
We smashed their biggest training

1200
01:13:28,493 --> 01:13:32,495
and operation camp in one night.

1201
01:13:33,078 --> 01:13:36,662
And the entire credit
goes to Adil Khan.

1202
01:13:39,162 --> 01:13:41,403
Sir, I am Mansi Dubey
from Dainik Bhaskar.

1203
01:13:41,493 --> 01:13:44,905
Are you certain,
there were no innocent

1204
01:13:44,995 --> 01:13:47,413
among 64 dead tribals?
- Look,

1205
01:13:48,328 --> 01:13:51,162
the police doesn't
target innocent civilians.

1206
01:13:51,287 --> 01:13:53,953
When police violate human rights,
why isn't there any enquiry?

1207
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:55,453
There should be.

1208
01:13:55,745 --> 01:13:57,078
Let's get one thing straight.

1209
01:13:57,370 --> 01:13:59,037
There is a war going on
in Nandighat

1210
01:13:59,245 --> 01:14:00,447
which is started by the Maoists

1211
01:14:00,537 --> 01:14:02,078
against the sovereignty
of our country.

1212
01:14:02,370 --> 01:14:05,037
A war whose rules we can't decide

1213
01:14:05,413 --> 01:14:07,620
because the Naxalites
doesn't follow any rules.

1214
01:14:07,995 --> 01:14:09,655
If you are concerned
about the human rights,

1215
01:14:09,745 --> 01:14:12,245
why don't we talk about
their violence first?

1216
01:14:13,245 --> 01:14:15,287
2000 policemen lost their lives

1217
01:14:15,413 --> 01:14:17,203
because they were
protecting our country.

1218
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:20,703
I suggest you start an inquiry
about their death first

1219
01:14:20,953 --> 01:14:24,493
and then I'll reply
to your allegations.

1220
01:14:36,870 --> 01:14:38,120
You were hurt, weren't you?

1221
01:14:39,603 --> 01:14:40,553
How are you?

1222
01:14:40,643 --> 01:14:43,228
Why didn't you give a warning?
Why you started firing directly?

1223
01:14:44,395 --> 01:14:45,638
We did warn, Kabir!

1224
01:14:45,728 --> 01:14:47,685
The music was so loud,
nobody heard it.

1225
01:14:48,062 --> 01:14:50,097
Their guards began firing,
what could we do?

1226
01:14:50,187 --> 01:14:51,478
Would we put down our arms?

1227
01:14:51,685 --> 01:14:53,062
This wasn't right, Adil.

1228
01:14:53,437 --> 01:14:56,228
Children, old people, women,
most people there were innocent.

1229
01:14:57,062 --> 01:14:58,810
Innocent people don't come
for arms training, Kabir.

1230
01:14:59,395 --> 01:15:02,228
They feel the government
has done nothing for them

1231
01:15:02,437 --> 01:15:04,560
and now wants to even
grab their land and homes.

1232
01:15:04,770 --> 01:15:06,935
They think the government
and police support Mahanta.

1233
01:15:07,062 --> 01:15:08,353
Listen Kabir,

1234
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:11,603
I trust you completely.

1235
01:15:12,103 --> 01:15:13,685
Otherwise, I would have
never let you go in.

1236
01:15:14,312 --> 01:15:18,312
But, if you are getting confused
by their pointless propaganda

1237
01:15:18,437 --> 01:15:20,560
and want to leave the mission,
then it's fine with me.

1238
01:15:20,810 --> 01:15:23,895
Nothing is more important
to me than you.

1239
01:15:25,312 --> 01:15:27,437
Did I say I want to leave?

1240
01:15:28,062 --> 01:15:30,187
I took up this mission to help you.

1241
01:15:30,895 --> 01:15:32,347
I thought you'd understand

1242
01:15:32,437 --> 01:15:34,228
that their fight is for
their rights.

1243
01:15:36,728 --> 01:15:38,895
Their means are wrong.

1244
01:15:39,728 --> 01:15:43,312
I know that you're pained
by seeing their terrible condition.

1245
01:15:43,978 --> 01:15:47,103
What can be more shameful
for this country?

1246
01:15:48,020 --> 01:15:50,603
But, still, if there is no
development here,

1247
01:15:52,228 --> 01:15:54,312
this place will truly become hell.

1248
01:15:55,437 --> 01:15:57,478
You see, what both of us
are doing here

1249
01:15:58,728 --> 01:16:01,395
will eventually benefit
the local people.

1250
01:16:03,728 --> 01:16:05,353
Okay? Good.

1251
01:16:06,020 --> 01:16:07,055
Listen,

1252
01:16:07,145 --> 01:16:09,643
as soon as we get Rajan,
you get out.

1253
01:16:11,728 --> 01:16:13,810
I'll make arrangements for you,
okay?

1254
01:16:48,395 --> 01:16:50,603
Congratulations, Mr Mahanta.
- Most welcome, sir.

1255
01:16:51,478 --> 01:16:53,062
Please come, Chief Minister.
- Yes.

1256
01:16:53,437 --> 01:16:55,935
Congratulations, SP.
I have double good news for you.

1257
01:16:56,395 --> 01:16:58,180
You've done such good work for us,

1258
01:16:58,270 --> 01:16:59,895
we feel it's our duty
to do something for you.

1259
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:03,062
I agree we can't end your
exile in Nandighat,

1260
01:17:03,228 --> 01:17:05,978
but thought I'd send
Goddess Sita herself to you.

1261
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:09,770
The cabinet has
cleared the proposal

1262
01:17:09,895 --> 01:17:11,770
for a Special Intelligence Cell
in Nandighat.

1263
01:17:12,103 --> 01:17:14,770
And, we're posting Rhea Menon
here as its director.

1264
01:17:15,437 --> 01:17:16,720
Thank you, sir.

1265
01:17:16,810 --> 01:17:19,560
Nobody can stop you from winning
the President's Gold Medal.

1266
01:17:19,810 --> 01:17:22,270
Get yourself a new suit
for the felicitation ceremony.

1267
01:17:35,728 --> 01:17:38,270
Our progress will be incomplete

1268
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:40,770
as long as the poor, backward,

1269
01:17:40,895 --> 01:17:42,770
and tribal society
does not progress.

1270
01:17:43,020 --> 01:17:44,603
And for that it is important

1271
01:17:44,935 --> 01:17:47,728
that there is education,
health, and employment here.

1272
01:17:47,935 --> 01:17:52,013
The government needs to bring
all amenities to your homes

1273
01:17:52,103 --> 01:17:53,560
and we will do that.

1274
01:17:54,020 --> 01:17:57,312
The steel factory being set up
by the Mahanta group

1275
01:17:57,478 --> 01:17:58,972
is especially for you!

1276
01:17:59,062 --> 01:18:02,437
Only if there's progress in your
homes, the nation will progress.

1277
01:18:21,270 --> 01:18:23,478
Nothing is going right, Comrade.

1278
01:18:26,353 --> 01:18:28,560
I know the training camp
was your responsibility.

1279
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:32,395
But, you are not responsible
for what happened.

1280
01:18:35,643 --> 01:18:37,770
63 people martyred.

1281
01:18:40,270 --> 01:18:42,437
Comrade Shivram,

1282
01:18:44,935 --> 01:18:46,478
Chakravarthy...

1283
01:18:52,685 --> 01:18:54,437
What do we do now?

1284
01:18:57,978 --> 01:19:00,978
The Mahanta project
ruined everything.

1285
01:19:03,603 --> 01:19:05,145
How will we fight them now?

1286
01:19:05,603 --> 01:19:08,478
You're ever ready and courageous,

1287
01:19:10,353 --> 01:19:12,228
but you're looking
so helpless today.

1288
01:19:13,978 --> 01:19:16,520
It proves that you too are a human.

1289
01:19:18,603 --> 01:19:19,978
What should I do?

1290
01:19:24,312 --> 01:19:26,395
You tell me, what should I do?

1291
01:19:30,187 --> 01:19:32,603
This kind of war is always
a game of confidence.

1292
01:19:34,312 --> 01:19:36,520
The self-confidence
of the two leaders.

1293
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:39,312
Adil Khan knows this very well.

1294
01:19:40,895 --> 01:19:43,353
I have studied his record closely.

1295
01:19:45,935 --> 01:19:47,305
Now, you now have to think

1296
01:19:47,395 --> 01:19:50,270
how can break his self-confidence.

1297
01:19:51,437 --> 01:19:53,895
Comrade, you need to do
something big.

1298
01:19:57,560 --> 01:20:00,305
Milord, there are
17 different cases registered

1299
01:20:00,395 --> 01:20:03,062
against Govind Suryavanshi
in Nandighat.

1300
01:20:03,560 --> 01:20:05,187
Your Honour, even I am saying
the same thing.

1301
01:20:06,062 --> 01:20:08,353
Instead of holding trials
in different places

1302
01:20:08,728 --> 01:20:11,478
why don't you transfer all the
cases in one place?

1303
01:20:11,935 --> 01:20:13,895
Transfer remand granted.

1304
01:20:16,353 --> 01:20:17,978
I read in the newspaper,

1305
01:20:18,353 --> 01:20:20,103
you are also going to Nandighat.

1306
01:20:20,353 --> 01:20:21,603
Right, Professor.

1307
01:20:21,770 --> 01:20:23,895
And that's why I didn't want to
leave you behind.

1308
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:28,685
We must fulfill this mission
at any cost, Comrades.

1309
01:20:29,312 --> 01:20:31,513
We will enter the enemy's home
and kill him

1310
01:20:31,603 --> 01:20:33,560
and crush his arrogance.

1311
01:20:34,187 --> 01:20:35,978
Change your uniforms

1312
01:20:36,353 --> 01:20:38,347
and split into smaller teams

1313
01:20:38,437 --> 01:20:42,270
with your team leader and enter the
city from different directions.

1314
01:20:43,978 --> 01:20:45,643
Lal Salam!
- Lal Salam!

1315
01:20:47,728 --> 01:20:49,638
Change your uniforms!

1316
01:20:49,728 --> 01:20:52,020
You two will stand on the road
outside the gates

1317
01:20:52,145 --> 01:20:53,643
of the police headquarters.

1318
01:20:53,770 --> 01:20:55,470
As soon as the
police vehicles leave,

1319
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:56,888
inform me over the walkie-talkie.

1320
01:20:56,978 --> 01:20:57,935
Yes.
- Move.

1321
01:20:58,062 --> 01:20:59,685
Comrade, no mistakes.
- No.

1322
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:01,680
Lal Salam.
- Lal Salam.

1323
01:21:01,770 --> 01:21:04,270
'Police station, Nandighat'

1324
01:21:09,935 --> 01:21:11,683
The police have left
with Comrade Govind.

1325
01:21:11,853 --> 01:21:12,810
You all leave from there.

1326
01:21:33,770 --> 01:21:35,222
Move to the side.
- Hey!

1327
01:21:35,312 --> 01:21:36,222
Stop!
- Where are you going?

1328
01:21:36,312 --> 01:21:38,353
Move to the side.

1329
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:40,395
They're VIP cars coming.
Move aside.

1330
01:21:57,810 --> 01:21:58,978
'District court'

1331
01:22:31,895 --> 01:22:32,935
Let's go!

1332
01:22:51,228 --> 01:22:52,437
Cover me.

1333
01:22:57,312 --> 01:22:58,228
Sir.

1334
01:23:27,478 --> 01:23:28,643
'Advocate, Kapil R. Tiwari'

1335
01:23:34,312 --> 01:23:35,478
Hey!

1336
01:23:38,187 --> 01:23:39,312
No!

1337
01:23:44,478 --> 01:23:45,638
No!

1338
01:23:45,728 --> 01:23:47,560
Come Juhi, let's go!

1339
01:23:47,728 --> 01:23:49,395
Dad!

1340
01:23:50,020 --> 01:23:52,228
Come on, let's go!
- Juhi!

1341
01:23:53,062 --> 01:23:54,810
Kill everyone.

1342
01:24:07,560 --> 01:24:09,560
Well done, Adil.
Well done.

1343
01:24:11,062 --> 01:24:14,520
I don't understand
why he is being kept alive.

1344
01:24:14,935 --> 01:24:16,430
Sir is here.
- Sir...

1345
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:18,270
Sir, one question, please.
- Sir.

1346
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:20,395
This is a fantastic victory for us.

1347
01:24:20,685 --> 01:24:22,520
Adil Khan has broken their morale.

1348
01:24:22,978 --> 01:24:24,888
Our men fought with courage

1349
01:24:24,978 --> 01:24:26,553
and achieved a tremendous victory.

1350
01:24:26,643 --> 01:24:28,720
How can you call this your victory

1351
01:24:28,810 --> 01:24:31,187
when, in broad daylight,
the Naxals attack your city

1352
01:24:31,312 --> 01:24:33,770
and escape with their
leader Govind Suryavanshi?

1353
01:24:33,978 --> 01:24:38,395
Even the Gods
can't please you journalists.

1354
01:24:38,770 --> 01:24:40,180
You always talk negative.

1355
01:24:40,270 --> 01:24:42,395
What will the old sick teacher
going to do anyway?

1356
01:24:42,728 --> 01:24:43,978
Let them take him.

1357
01:24:44,270 --> 01:24:47,228
We have their commander-in-chief,

1358
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:51,145
Rajan. The man responsible
for terrorising Nandighat.

1359
01:24:51,685 --> 01:24:54,187
We have won the battle there.

1360
01:24:58,560 --> 01:24:59,643
Thanks.

1361
01:25:00,353 --> 01:25:01,853
Don't look so disappointed.

1362
01:25:03,187 --> 01:25:04,560
Believe me,

1363
01:25:05,020 --> 01:25:06,560
you've won.

1364
01:25:06,685 --> 01:25:08,395
And I'm really proud of you.

1365
01:25:09,353 --> 01:25:10,853
But, I lost Govind.

1366
01:25:11,560 --> 01:25:12,978
So what, Adil?

1367
01:25:13,187 --> 01:25:14,680
I have asked permission

1368
01:25:14,770 --> 01:25:16,895
for satellite surveillance
over entire Nandighat.

1369
01:25:17,685 --> 01:25:19,437
I'll fix cameras everywhere.

1370
01:25:19,853 --> 01:25:22,560
He can't escape.
- He won't escape, anyway.

1371
01:25:23,187 --> 01:25:25,145
I will get information
about him soon.

1372
01:25:25,560 --> 01:25:27,603
Tell me something, Adil,

1373
01:25:27,853 --> 01:25:31,603
how did you setup such a reliable
information network so soon?

1374
01:25:32,228 --> 01:25:35,353
I mean, you have turned the biggest
weakness of Nandighat police

1375
01:25:35,560 --> 01:25:38,560
into your biggest strength. How?

1376
01:25:39,145 --> 01:25:42,270
Well, intelligence leads
to intelligence.

1377
01:25:43,478 --> 01:25:45,810
Necessity is the mother
of all invention.

1378
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:48,437
Helplessness is the other
name for Mahatma Gandhi.

1379
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:52,560
This is rich.
Gandhi with a gun.

1380
01:25:53,103 --> 01:25:54,810
Gandhi with a gun.
- Something like that.

1381
01:26:23,728 --> 01:26:25,810
You have done wonders, Mr Adil.

1382
01:26:26,187 --> 01:26:28,685
My son is a huge fan
of your courage.

1383
01:26:29,560 --> 01:26:31,853
It is only because of you
that this project will take off.

1384
01:26:32,312 --> 01:26:33,187
Please, sir.

1385
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:34,895
I am just doing my duty

1386
01:26:35,395 --> 01:26:38,228
and I will try my best to see the
Naxals don't bother you. - Okay.

1387
01:26:38,353 --> 01:26:40,187
Why don't you do one more thing?

1388
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:42,763
This is the list of
230 tribal villages

1389
01:26:42,853 --> 01:26:45,353
residing on our project
and mining areas.

1390
01:26:45,978 --> 01:26:47,810
Get them evacuated.

1391
01:26:48,810 --> 01:26:51,020
Don't worry about the cost.

1392
01:26:53,770 --> 01:26:56,470
Mr Mahanta,
to evacuate the villages,

1393
01:26:56,560 --> 01:26:58,805
you will need to contact the
Collector and Revenue Department.

1394
01:26:58,895 --> 01:27:01,978
Yes SP, we will do that.

1395
01:27:02,685 --> 01:27:05,430
You know
these villagers won't leave

1396
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:07,228
unless you use your stick.

1397
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:10,138
Forgive me, Mr Mahanta,

1398
01:27:10,228 --> 01:27:12,685
but my stick is used to
maintain law and order.

1399
01:27:13,062 --> 01:27:14,770
And, when needed for that,

1400
01:27:15,145 --> 01:27:16,728
I will use it to good effect.

1401
01:27:19,062 --> 01:27:20,728
Thank you, Mr Khan.

1402
01:27:21,560 --> 01:27:23,853
Thank you for coming.

1403
01:27:31,062 --> 01:27:33,312
I've talked to the
Central Committee.

1404
01:27:33,770 --> 01:27:36,520
They'll supply arms
on an emergency basis.

1405
01:27:37,103 --> 01:27:40,770
We'll go to the villages
who have been asked to leave

1406
01:27:41,103 --> 01:27:43,395
and ask them to protest.

1407
01:27:44,853 --> 01:27:48,270
What you wished for,
will happen now, Rajan.

1408
01:27:48,520 --> 01:27:50,895
We will fight.

1409
01:27:53,935 --> 01:27:54,978
What happened?

1410
01:27:55,145 --> 01:27:56,853
You called Kabir as Rajan.

1411
01:27:57,395 --> 01:27:58,437
Oh.

1412
01:28:03,853 --> 01:28:05,145
He is just like Rajan.

1413
01:28:06,853 --> 01:28:09,895
Nobody can take
Comrade Rajan's place.

1414
01:28:13,810 --> 01:28:15,270
That's true.

1415
01:28:19,853 --> 01:28:21,770
I really miss him,

1416
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:27,478
but we have to carry on his work.

1417
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:31,180
I want you to take
on his responsibility

1418
01:28:31,270 --> 01:28:33,643
for training and fight back.

1419
01:28:35,312 --> 01:28:38,353
Hereafter, your revolutionary
name is, Azad!

1420
01:28:41,437 --> 01:28:42,810
Lal Salam.
- Lal Salam!

1421
01:28:42,935 --> 01:28:44,810
Lal Salam.

1422
01:28:48,478 --> 01:28:50,935
Jobs, commission, and progress,

1423
01:28:51,145 --> 01:28:53,062
you will get all the benefits.

1424
01:28:53,560 --> 01:28:56,560
But until we get the land,
how will the project begin?

1425
01:28:56,770 --> 01:28:59,643
These 230 villages
have to be evacuated soon.

1426
01:29:00,853 --> 01:29:02,560
You have done this before too.

1427
01:29:02,978 --> 01:29:06,513
Look Mr Mahanta,
after the Supreme Court orders,

1428
01:29:06,603 --> 01:29:08,643
Salwa Judum has ended.
- Really?

1429
01:29:09,478 --> 01:29:13,603
But you people have your own
private armies, don't you?

1430
01:29:14,437 --> 01:29:16,638
We appreciate such straight talk.

1431
01:29:16,728 --> 01:29:18,395
You make a contract

1432
01:29:18,728 --> 01:29:21,020
and you will get results every day.
Right? - Yes.

1433
01:29:21,560 --> 01:29:22,845
One more thing,

1434
01:29:22,935 --> 01:29:25,470
the more money you put
in our hands,

1435
01:29:25,560 --> 01:29:28,145
we will increase the pressure

1436
01:29:28,520 --> 01:29:30,560
and get the work done faster.
- No tension.

1437
01:29:30,728 --> 01:29:33,728
I value time more than
anything else.

1438
01:29:34,643 --> 01:29:37,312
As for the government,
leave it to me.

1439
01:29:37,437 --> 01:29:39,770
We stopped worrying
about them, long ago.

1440
01:29:41,643 --> 01:29:43,763
Move ahead!

1441
01:29:43,853 --> 01:29:45,270
Come on, move!

1442
01:29:45,395 --> 01:29:46,810
Come on, move!

1443
01:29:47,353 --> 01:29:51,062
This is an appeal
to all the villagers.

1444
01:29:51,770 --> 01:29:54,895
Evacuate the place immediately

1445
01:29:55,020 --> 01:29:59,395
with your utensils and provisions.

1446
01:30:00,770 --> 01:30:02,685
Evacuate the village!

1447
01:30:03,560 --> 01:30:05,478
Do not worry.

1448
01:30:13,437 --> 01:30:14,895
No!

1449
01:30:16,437 --> 01:30:17,770
Get going!

1450
01:30:18,270 --> 01:30:20,437
This is the government's order,

1451
01:30:20,770 --> 01:30:22,685
only for your benefit.

1452
01:30:22,978 --> 01:30:24,810
Get going!

1453
01:30:24,935 --> 01:30:27,145
The government will
guarantee a bright future

1454
01:30:27,270 --> 01:30:30,187
and will take care of you.

1455
01:30:30,437 --> 01:30:33,347
You support the government.

1456
01:30:33,437 --> 01:30:35,770
The government is with you!

1457
01:30:36,187 --> 01:30:40,263
A bright future awaits,
move to the camp.

1458
01:30:40,353 --> 01:30:42,103
Get going!

1459
01:30:43,020 --> 01:30:45,270
Don't worry!

1460
01:30:45,478 --> 01:30:47,595
Evacuate the village!

1461
01:30:47,685 --> 01:30:49,853
Don't worry.

1462
01:30:50,353 --> 01:30:51,810
Empty the village!

1463
01:30:52,395 --> 01:30:54,395
Please help us.

1464
01:30:54,603 --> 01:30:56,520
Demolish it!

1465
01:31:03,685 --> 01:31:05,353
Get going!

1466
01:31:05,560 --> 01:31:07,353
Get going!

1467
01:31:33,560 --> 01:31:35,395
You!

1468
01:31:36,020 --> 01:31:37,895
I will thrash you!

1469
01:31:38,978 --> 01:31:40,728
Come on.

1470
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:43,720
Hey, come here.
- The police don't help.

1471
01:31:43,810 --> 01:31:45,805
And when the villagers
evacuate on their own,

1472
01:31:45,895 --> 01:31:47,305
you arrest them!

1473
01:31:47,395 --> 01:31:49,145
I mean, is this a joke or what?

1474
01:31:50,020 --> 01:31:52,560
Sir, it's the Nandighat SP on line.

1475
01:31:54,978 --> 01:31:58,560
SP, the cabinet has approved

1476
01:31:59,062 --> 01:32:01,935
the voluntary evacuation
by the villagers,

1477
01:32:02,145 --> 01:32:03,845
do not interfere.

1478
01:32:03,935 --> 01:32:07,097
Sir, it wasn't voluntary,
force was being used.

1479
01:32:07,187 --> 01:32:08,763
SP!

1480
01:32:08,853 --> 01:32:11,312
Petty fights happen even
during festival times.

1481
01:32:11,603 --> 01:32:13,187
Does that mean
you will arrest all of them?

1482
01:32:13,560 --> 01:32:14,685
Let them go.

1483
01:32:14,935 --> 01:32:16,935
You focus on the Naxals,
they will manage the villages.

1484
01:32:17,145 --> 01:32:19,935
Please try to understand, sir.
The situation is very tense.

1485
01:32:20,560 --> 01:32:22,560
The tribals are already
angry with the government.

1486
01:32:22,978 --> 01:32:25,470
By doing this, whatever little
goodwill we have made,

1487
01:32:25,560 --> 01:32:27,013
will also be...
- To hell with goodwill!

1488
01:32:27,103 --> 01:32:29,437
We just need the land, that's all!
- I am sorry, sir.

1489
01:32:29,728 --> 01:32:32,312
But if anyone breaks the law
in my jurisdiction,

1490
01:32:32,853 --> 01:32:34,478
I will take action on him!

1491
01:32:35,395 --> 01:32:37,560
It won't take me even one second
to get him transferred!

1492
01:32:37,853 --> 01:32:39,145
How dare he teach me the law?

1493
01:32:39,478 --> 01:32:40,560
Talk to him!

1494
01:32:44,353 --> 01:32:47,312
Adil, I am sending a special unit

1495
01:32:47,603 --> 01:32:49,560
to supervise land acquisition.

1496
01:32:50,062 --> 01:32:51,643
They will report directly to me.

1497
01:32:52,312 --> 01:32:53,770
Release them.

1498
01:32:54,062 --> 01:32:55,270
Sir, this is not right.

1499
01:32:55,560 --> 01:32:57,935
It's no longer your jurisdiction,
Adil Khan.

1500
01:32:58,560 --> 01:32:59,520
Leave it to me.

1501
01:33:01,062 --> 01:33:02,312
Thank you.

1502
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:04,312
'No longer my jurisdiction'.

1503
01:33:08,062 --> 01:33:10,187
They destroyed our training camp.

1504
01:33:11,643 --> 01:33:13,853
They killed dozens of our comrades.

1505
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:17,437
This was a well thought plan
by Adil Khan

1506
01:33:18,145 --> 01:33:20,810
to weaken us.

1507
01:33:21,270 --> 01:33:22,763
But, we must get arms again

1508
01:33:22,853 --> 01:33:24,470
and retaliate strongly.

1509
01:33:24,560 --> 01:33:25,895
Not now.

1510
01:33:26,353 --> 01:33:28,478
First of all,
we must use whatever we have

1511
01:33:28,853 --> 01:33:30,145
to reinitiate

1512
01:33:30,685 --> 01:33:32,728
and feed these helpless people.

1513
01:33:33,103 --> 01:33:34,685
It will be too late by then.

1514
01:33:35,437 --> 01:33:37,103
This is the truth of our country.

1515
01:33:37,853 --> 01:33:39,603
Nobody cares about the poor.

1516
01:33:40,353 --> 01:33:42,228
The big projects and businesses,

1517
01:33:42,685 --> 01:33:44,187
only care about profits.

1518
01:33:44,395 --> 01:33:45,930
The state, police,

1519
01:33:46,020 --> 01:33:48,560
and the system,
everything is for them.

1520
01:33:48,853 --> 01:33:50,728
Nothing for the common man.

1521
01:33:51,228 --> 01:33:52,728
That is why we fight.

1522
01:33:53,020 --> 01:33:54,520
And we will continue
with all our power.

1523
01:33:55,728 --> 01:33:57,638
But right now

1524
01:33:57,728 --> 01:34:00,478
we need to heal their wounds.

1525
01:34:01,395 --> 01:34:03,145
Juhi, my dear,

1526
01:34:03,560 --> 01:34:04,930
whatever funds the
Area Commander has,

1527
01:34:05,020 --> 01:34:07,103
call for it.

1528
01:34:08,643 --> 01:34:11,895
Dad, we don't have much left.

1529
01:34:12,935 --> 01:34:15,978
Naga's collections were huge,

1530
01:34:17,020 --> 01:34:18,978
but he denies it bluntly.

1531
01:34:44,643 --> 01:34:50,770
"Don't put a price on love,
beloved."

1532
01:34:54,020 --> 01:35:00,520
"Weigh it with your eyes."

1533
01:35:01,395 --> 01:35:06,395
"O Kabir, open the pot."

1534
01:35:07,560 --> 01:35:12,853
"O Kabir, open the pot."

1535
01:35:13,770 --> 01:35:19,520
"O Kabir, open the pot."

1536
01:35:20,270 --> 01:35:25,895
"O Kabir, open the pot."

1537
01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:29,353
"Open."

1538
01:35:29,478 --> 01:35:31,603
"Open the pot."

1539
01:35:32,935 --> 01:35:34,978
"Open."

1540
01:35:39,187 --> 01:35:42,013
"Since I've become the spirit
of the neighbourhood."

1541
01:35:42,103 --> 01:35:46,680
"My heart is wounded
and my eyes are faithless."

1542
01:35:46,770 --> 01:35:50,560
"My heart is wounded
and my eyes are faithless."

1543
01:35:51,478 --> 01:35:54,470
"My senses are lost
and my faith is shaken."

1544
01:35:54,560 --> 01:35:58,560
"Since I've become the spirit
of the neighbourhood."

1545
01:36:01,103 --> 01:36:04,138
"The noise within can no longer
be suppressed."

1546
01:36:04,228 --> 01:36:08,395
"Beloved, tell me
your hearts desires."

1547
01:36:09,560 --> 01:36:15,520
"O Kabir, open the pot."

1548
01:36:16,062 --> 01:36:21,020
"O Kabir, open the pot."

1549
01:36:22,312 --> 01:36:27,560
"O Kabir, open the pot."

1550
01:36:28,395 --> 01:36:34,520
"O Kabir, open the pot."

1551
01:36:35,187 --> 01:36:38,055
"O darling, open the pot."

1552
01:36:38,145 --> 01:36:41,145
"O darling, open the pot."

1553
01:36:41,478 --> 01:36:44,312
"O darling, open the pot."

1554
01:36:44,560 --> 01:36:48,978
"O darling, open the pot."

1555
01:36:49,187 --> 01:36:55,097
"My kohled eyes will kill you."

1556
01:36:55,187 --> 01:36:58,520
"Your eyes are amazing."

1557
01:36:58,728 --> 01:37:01,805
"A gentleman has become a lover."

1558
01:37:01,895 --> 01:37:05,603
"Love has blossomed."

1559
01:37:08,062 --> 01:37:11,138
"The night has passed
and it is dawn."

1560
01:37:11,228 --> 01:37:15,685
"Don't delay anymore."

1561
01:37:16,395 --> 01:37:23,103
"O Kabir, open the pot."

1562
01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:29,020
"O Kabir, open the pot."

1563
01:37:29,978 --> 01:37:35,728
"O Kabir, open the pot."

1564
01:37:36,312 --> 01:37:41,643
"O Kabir, open the pot."

1565
01:37:43,270 --> 01:37:46,643
"O Kabir, open the pot."

1566
01:38:02,978 --> 01:38:04,013
No, Kabir!

1567
01:38:04,103 --> 01:38:06,062
The decision will be made
in the people's court.

1568
01:38:07,685 --> 01:38:10,312
Lal Salam!
- Lal Salam!

1569
01:38:10,935 --> 01:38:12,895
Lies! All lies!

1570
01:38:13,685 --> 01:38:15,895
You have no proof, Comrade.

1571
01:38:17,353 --> 01:38:19,062
My accounts are clear.

1572
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:22,437
I have never forced myself
on any woman comrade.

1573
01:38:23,020 --> 01:38:24,638
All false allegations!
I'm telling you.

1574
01:38:24,728 --> 01:38:26,935
Come on!
- Let me go.

1575
01:38:27,395 --> 01:38:28,643
Come on!

1576
01:38:29,187 --> 01:38:30,560
Get up!
- Let me go.

1577
01:38:31,020 --> 01:38:32,097
Come on!

1578
01:38:32,187 --> 01:38:33,353
Speak up!

1579
01:38:33,520 --> 01:38:35,560
Why are you silent now? Scoundrel.

1580
01:38:37,228 --> 01:38:39,643
The rules of the
people's court are clear.

1581
01:38:41,395 --> 01:38:44,560
The money which the area
commanders collect,

1582
01:38:45,062 --> 01:38:47,062
belongs only to the Movement.

1583
01:38:48,103 --> 01:38:49,810
Naga has broken this rule

1584
01:38:50,228 --> 01:38:53,187
and misused his position

1585
01:38:53,978 --> 01:38:55,810
for his personal pleasure.

1586
01:38:58,560 --> 01:39:01,353
The only punishment for this is,

1587
01:39:02,228 --> 01:39:03,478
death!

1588
01:39:08,312 --> 01:39:09,805
Let me go!

1589
01:39:09,895 --> 01:39:11,895
Let me go. I don't want to be
a part of the Movement.

1590
01:39:12,187 --> 01:39:13,470
Let me go!

1591
01:39:13,560 --> 01:39:16,395
The verdict of the people's
court does not apply to me.

1592
01:39:16,978 --> 01:39:18,895
Let me go!

1593
01:39:29,228 --> 01:39:32,180
Lal Salam!
- Lal Salam.

1594
01:39:32,270 --> 01:39:34,062
'Red revolution is immortal'

1595
01:39:41,145 --> 01:39:42,312
I see some movement there.

1596
01:39:43,187 --> 01:39:44,720
Enlarge it. Quick.
- Yes, ma'am.

1597
01:39:44,810 --> 01:39:47,187
Trace the location through GSM.
Quick. - Yes, ma'am.

1598
01:39:51,560 --> 01:39:53,478
Hello.
- Adil, I need you here quickly.

1599
01:39:53,643 --> 01:39:54,935
I've spotted movement
on the satellite.

1600
01:39:55,187 --> 01:39:56,145
I'll be there.

1601
01:39:56,810 --> 01:39:59,437
GPS, North 23.

1602
01:40:00,062 --> 01:40:03,685
15.59507, East 77.

1603
01:40:03,978 --> 01:40:05,770
Ma'am, it's the Barakhedi village.

1604
01:40:06,810 --> 01:40:08,222
Barakhedi village?

1605
01:40:08,312 --> 01:40:09,895
I know where Barakhedi is.

1606
01:40:10,685 --> 01:40:11,930
Rajaram.
- Yes, sir.

1607
01:40:12,020 --> 01:40:15,062
Find out who is patrolling
near Barakhedi. - Yes, sir.

1608
01:40:16,603 --> 01:40:17,978
Sir, there's a call
from the headquarters.

1609
01:40:20,062 --> 01:40:21,055
Hello.
- 'Madhav Rao.'

1610
01:40:21,145 --> 01:40:21,935
Sir?

1611
01:40:22,145 --> 01:40:24,270
We've tracked movement
in Barakhedi. Check it out.

1612
01:40:25,853 --> 01:40:27,560
Sir, we are quite close by.
- Good.

1613
01:40:28,062 --> 01:40:29,888
Enlarge this.
- Stop!

1614
01:40:29,978 --> 01:40:31,935
Stop!
- Go back.

1615
01:40:33,228 --> 01:40:34,520
Are you okay?

1616
01:40:37,478 --> 01:40:39,020
Comrade Azad?
- Yes.

1617
01:40:39,978 --> 01:40:41,187
What is wrong with you?

1618
01:40:42,187 --> 01:40:43,353
Nothing.

1619
01:40:46,560 --> 01:40:47,935
You guys carry on,

1620
01:40:48,770 --> 01:40:50,395
I'll get something and come.

1621
01:40:54,560 --> 01:40:56,437
Hello?
- Lal Salam.

1622
01:40:56,685 --> 01:40:57,845
Lal Salam.
- Lal Salam.

1623
01:40:57,935 --> 01:40:59,430
What's the use of this tower

1624
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:01,103
if there is no network?
- Lal Salam.

1625
01:41:01,312 --> 01:41:02,470
Lal Salam.
- No not this.

1626
01:41:02,560 --> 01:41:03,895
Lal Salam.
- Lal Salam.

1627
01:41:08,643 --> 01:41:10,145
Danger'

1628
01:41:14,228 --> 01:41:15,228
'Danger'

1629
01:41:36,062 --> 01:41:37,187
Hello.
- Hello.

1630
01:41:37,603 --> 01:41:38,770
It's me, Kabir.

1631
01:41:39,228 --> 01:41:41,395
How are you, partner?
- I want to meet you.

1632
01:41:41,935 --> 01:41:43,395
When can you meet me?
It's important.

1633
01:41:44,270 --> 01:41:45,470
It's a bit tight now.

1634
01:41:45,560 --> 01:41:47,603
Can we meet in 3-4 days?
- It's urgent, Adil.

1635
01:41:48,145 --> 01:41:49,685
Meet me tomorrow at the same place.

1636
01:41:50,728 --> 01:41:52,062
What's the matter, Kabir?
Are you alright?

1637
01:41:55,603 --> 01:41:56,643
I'll tell you when we meet.

1638
01:41:58,020 --> 01:41:59,103
Okay, tomorrow at 6:00
at same place.

1639
01:42:01,103 --> 01:42:02,437
Whose number is this?
Where are you calling from?

1640
01:42:02,810 --> 01:42:04,728
Barakhedi village.
- Barakhedi?

1641
01:42:05,353 --> 01:42:06,810
Get out of there, right now!

1642
01:42:07,228 --> 01:42:08,305
Why? What happened?

1643
01:42:08,395 --> 01:42:10,395
I've sent Madhav Rao
to raid the place.

1644
01:42:10,685 --> 01:42:12,728
'Get out immediately!
Okay? Fast.'

1645
01:42:16,643 --> 01:42:18,353
The police are here!

1646
01:42:22,853 --> 01:42:24,810
Where have they gone?
Where are they hiding?

1647
01:42:25,145 --> 01:42:26,103
Catch them!

1648
01:42:33,643 --> 01:42:36,560
I think Balu and others are hiding.

1649
01:42:36,978 --> 01:42:38,680
They're waiting
for your orders, Comrade.

1650
01:42:38,770 --> 01:42:39,553
Catch them!

1651
01:42:39,643 --> 01:42:40,728
We must be careful.

1652
01:42:41,437 --> 01:42:43,103
The lives of women
and children are in danger.

1653
01:42:46,062 --> 01:42:48,437
Come out!

1654
01:42:49,437 --> 01:42:51,222
Come out!
- You scoundrel!

1655
01:42:51,312 --> 01:42:52,895
Let the children go.

1656
01:43:05,187 --> 01:43:06,055
Juhi?

1657
01:43:06,145 --> 01:43:08,845
Get them out or I'll...

1658
01:43:08,935 --> 01:43:10,728
If I walk out now,

1659
01:43:10,935 --> 01:43:11,972
only I will be arrested.

1660
01:43:12,062 --> 01:43:13,187
Drag all of them out here.

1661
01:43:13,478 --> 01:43:15,138
Come out!
- Otherwise these scoundrels

1662
01:43:15,228 --> 01:43:16,430
won't spare even the women
and children.

1663
01:43:16,520 --> 01:43:17,560
Bring them all out!

1664
01:43:17,895 --> 01:43:19,187
Come out!

1665
01:43:19,770 --> 01:43:21,770
Inform the others not to fire.

1666
01:43:31,353 --> 01:43:32,603
Wonderful!

1667
01:43:33,560 --> 01:43:35,437
Comrade Juhi herself.

1668
01:43:38,395 --> 01:43:40,187
You sully woman!

1669
01:43:40,770 --> 01:43:41,603
Pankaj,

1670
01:43:42,145 --> 01:43:43,728
Juhi said not to fire.

1671
01:43:45,895 --> 01:43:46,810
Come on.

1672
01:43:50,477 --> 01:43:51,395
Come on!

1673
01:44:19,810 --> 01:44:21,347
Sir, should I inform head office?

1674
01:44:21,437 --> 01:44:23,470
'Section Four,
reveal your position.'

1675
01:44:23,560 --> 01:44:26,228
Disconnect it.

1676
01:44:26,437 --> 01:44:28,720
Let me investigate her first.

1677
01:44:28,810 --> 01:44:30,520
'Section Four,
reveal your position. Over.'

1678
01:44:31,853 --> 01:44:33,312
Take the car to the
forest police post first.

1679
01:44:58,437 --> 01:45:01,520
Looking at you
it's hard to believe that

1680
01:45:02,270 --> 01:45:06,020
you have killed 49 cops.

1681
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:08,560
Untie my hands for a minute,

1682
01:45:09,643 --> 01:45:11,353
I will make it 50 now.

1683
01:45:39,895 --> 01:45:41,685
No! Let me go!

1684
01:45:49,560 --> 01:45:50,685
Leave her.

1685
01:45:51,312 --> 01:45:52,560
You guys go out.

1686
01:46:10,270 --> 01:46:11,978
We will take our right.

1687
01:46:21,478 --> 01:46:26,728
We will take our right.

1688
01:46:28,520 --> 01:46:30,145
We will take...

1689
01:46:30,935 --> 01:46:32,180
Inform sir

1690
01:46:32,270 --> 01:46:33,853
Barakhedi operation was a success.

1691
01:46:34,478 --> 01:46:36,685
I have arrested
Area Commander Juhi. - Okay, sir.

1692
01:46:43,187 --> 01:46:44,187
Let's go.

1693
01:46:46,145 --> 01:46:47,103
Let's go.

1694
01:46:51,395 --> 01:46:53,437
If you breathe,
you will die twice!

1695
01:46:54,478 --> 01:46:55,685
Do you get it?

1696
01:47:07,520 --> 01:47:08,513
Don't let him move.

1697
01:47:08,603 --> 01:47:09,728
We'll catch them
by tomorrow morning.

1698
01:47:21,312 --> 01:47:23,643
We will take our right.

1699
01:47:27,478 --> 01:47:28,853
Our...

1700
01:47:30,312 --> 01:47:31,560
Our right.

1701
01:47:34,312 --> 01:47:35,520
We'll take...

1702
01:48:37,520 --> 01:48:38,978
How are you?

1703
01:48:39,478 --> 01:48:40,643
What happened suddenly?

1704
01:48:40,853 --> 01:48:42,643
Can you stop the Mahanta Project?

1705
01:48:43,437 --> 01:48:44,305
What?

1706
01:48:44,395 --> 01:48:46,478
The project will
destroy this area, Adil.

1707
01:48:48,935 --> 01:48:50,013
See Kabir,

1708
01:48:50,103 --> 01:48:51,935
based on whose understanding
you're saying this,

1709
01:48:52,312 --> 01:48:54,312
they don't want...
- Can you stop it or not?

1710
01:48:56,103 --> 01:48:57,263
No.

1711
01:48:57,353 --> 01:48:58,978
Then you leave Nandighat.

1712
01:48:59,270 --> 01:49:00,560
Go back to Bhopal.

1713
01:49:01,103 --> 01:49:02,895
Go to Bhopal? Why?

1714
01:49:04,978 --> 01:49:06,603
I don't want anything
to happen to you.

1715
01:49:07,187 --> 01:49:08,353
To me?

1716
01:49:08,853 --> 01:49:10,055
What will happen to me?

1717
01:49:10,145 --> 01:49:11,395
You don't understand, Adil.

1718
01:49:12,145 --> 01:49:14,478
These people are very upset
with your actions.

1719
01:49:15,520 --> 01:49:16,728
They're bound to be

1720
01:49:16,978 --> 01:49:18,770
because Rajan is in our custody.

1721
01:49:19,395 --> 01:49:21,353
But, don't you worry about me.

1722
01:49:21,895 --> 01:49:24,062
We will end this mission together.

1723
01:49:25,020 --> 01:49:26,553
The goal for which you
took on this mission

1724
01:49:26,643 --> 01:49:27,643
is going to be achieved soon.

1725
01:49:28,187 --> 01:49:29,560
Look at this chip.

1726
01:49:29,810 --> 01:49:31,643
We will be able to track
your location.

1727
01:49:32,395 --> 01:49:34,263
Since they trust you fully,

1728
01:49:34,353 --> 01:49:35,685
they will not even check.

1729
01:49:36,062 --> 01:49:38,353
You just be near Govind
and Juhi tomorrow.

1730
01:49:39,395 --> 01:49:41,270
Only those two are left, Kabir.

1731
01:49:42,643 --> 01:49:44,728
Once they're finished,
the game is over.

1732
01:49:45,478 --> 01:49:46,595
Another thing.

1733
01:49:46,685 --> 01:49:49,020
Yesterday some Naxals attacked
the police post and freed Juhi

1734
01:49:49,560 --> 01:49:50,728
and abducted Madhav.

1735
01:49:51,978 --> 01:49:53,728
Find out where they have him.

1736
01:49:54,853 --> 01:49:56,810
Do you know what Madhav Rao did?

1737
01:49:58,270 --> 01:50:00,478
He arrested Juhi. What else?

1738
01:50:01,270 --> 01:50:03,560
He shot two children and a woman.

1739
01:50:04,810 --> 01:50:06,603
And threatened to burn down
the whole village.

1740
01:50:07,228 --> 01:50:10,145
To save innocent lives,
Juhi surrendered.

1741
01:50:10,810 --> 01:50:12,978
And then he took her
to the police station,

1742
01:50:13,770 --> 01:50:15,145
tortured her,

1743
01:50:16,560 --> 01:50:18,145
and raped her.

1744
01:50:18,978 --> 01:50:21,062
How can you be so sure of it?

1745
01:50:23,353 --> 01:50:25,228
Because I was there.
- You?

1746
01:50:26,810 --> 01:50:28,810
How could you have been there?
You'd left by then!

1747
01:50:34,187 --> 01:50:35,810
Did you do all that?

1748
01:50:36,560 --> 01:50:39,270
Did you attack the
police post, Kabir? - Yes.

1749
01:50:40,603 --> 01:50:42,478
And, it was I who freed Juhi.

1750
01:50:43,187 --> 01:50:45,103
It was I who killed 5 of your men.

1751
01:50:45,560 --> 01:50:47,685
I blew up the police post.

1752
01:50:48,560 --> 01:50:49,895
Madhav Rao is in my custody.

1753
01:50:50,020 --> 01:50:51,560
What the hell are you
talking about, Kabir!

1754
01:50:53,437 --> 01:50:55,810
Do you know the
consequences of this?

1755
01:50:56,978 --> 01:50:59,603
Why did you do this?

1756
01:51:00,643 --> 01:51:02,437
Have you lost your mind?

1757
01:51:03,478 --> 01:51:06,103
Release Madhav Rao immediately!

1758
01:51:06,560 --> 01:51:09,395
If he has committed a crime,
the law will punish him.

1759
01:51:09,728 --> 01:51:13,062
He will be tried in
our people's court.

1760
01:51:14,728 --> 01:51:16,685
Your people's court?

1761
01:51:18,810 --> 01:51:19,978
Wow, Kabir.

1762
01:51:20,437 --> 01:51:23,187
You too speak the language
of the gun's terrorism?

1763
01:51:23,395 --> 01:51:25,520
The terrorism of the gun
is nothing.

1764
01:51:26,810 --> 01:51:28,603
To keep the poor in poverty,

1765
01:51:29,145 --> 01:51:30,810
to loot their land,

1766
01:51:31,103 --> 01:51:33,103
to take away all their rights,

1767
01:51:33,395 --> 01:51:35,228
that is the real terrorism.

1768
01:51:36,478 --> 01:51:38,437
It is your government
who is doing this.

1769
01:51:39,978 --> 01:51:43,895
But now, anger is rising in
the blood of every poor tribal.

1770
01:51:45,187 --> 01:51:47,888
That anger will now emerge
from the barrel of the gun!

1771
01:51:47,978 --> 01:51:49,643
Stop this nonsense, Kabir!

1772
01:51:50,560 --> 01:51:53,560
No solution ever emerges
from the barrel of a gun.

1773
01:51:55,020 --> 01:51:57,603
And, the people whose cause
you're advocating

1774
01:51:58,395 --> 01:52:01,643
their methods are wrong
and even you know that very well.

1775
01:52:02,353 --> 01:52:04,470
The Maoists are using
the poor and helpless

1776
01:52:04,560 --> 01:52:07,770
tribals to gain power.

1777
01:52:09,270 --> 01:52:11,270
They're blackmailing our country.

1778
01:52:14,603 --> 01:52:15,895
Weren't you the one who said,

1779
01:52:16,145 --> 01:52:18,853
'If the system doesn't work
one should repair it'?

1780
01:52:21,145 --> 01:52:23,145
'No one gains anything
by destroying it'.

1781
01:52:24,685 --> 01:52:26,103
Kabir,

1782
01:52:27,395 --> 01:52:29,478
I am telling you for the
last time as a friend.

1783
01:52:30,770 --> 01:52:32,145
Release Madhav Rao.

1784
01:52:35,228 --> 01:52:37,228
This is beyond
our friendship now, Adil.

1785
01:52:42,020 --> 01:52:43,728
Alright then,

1786
01:52:44,437 --> 01:52:46,103
I'm ending this mission.

1787
01:52:47,560 --> 01:52:50,395
Leave now. Your work is done.
- No.

1788
01:52:52,020 --> 01:52:53,643
My mission has just begun.

1789
01:52:54,478 --> 01:52:55,978
I am completely with them.

1790
01:52:57,020 --> 01:52:59,770
Henceforth, if anybody,

1791
01:53:00,228 --> 01:53:02,685
touches a poor tribal,

1792
01:53:03,270 --> 01:53:06,103
I'll do to him exactly what I have
done with Madhav Rao.

1793
01:53:07,437 --> 01:53:08,895
No matter who it is.

1794
01:53:11,978 --> 01:53:14,062
So, finally you've revealed
your true colours.

1795
01:53:15,270 --> 01:53:17,520
When I was feeding a snake,
I didn't realise

1796
01:53:17,935 --> 01:53:19,770
that one day it would turn
around and bite me.

1797
01:53:21,478 --> 01:53:23,353
But remember one thing,

1798
01:53:24,685 --> 01:53:26,853
you are not only betraying me,

1799
01:53:27,103 --> 01:53:29,353
you're committing treason
against your country.

1800
01:53:30,560 --> 01:53:33,853
And you know the
punishment for treason.

1801
01:53:36,603 --> 01:53:38,520
From today, our friendship is over.

1802
01:53:44,895 --> 01:53:47,062
It is you who is showing
your true colours.

1803
01:53:47,560 --> 01:53:49,728
After all, you are a cop.

1804
01:53:51,145 --> 01:53:52,520
Kabir...

1805
01:53:53,103 --> 01:53:54,560
Don't do this, Kabir.

1806
01:53:55,978 --> 01:53:58,353
This will end
in a terrible tragedy.

1807
01:54:00,062 --> 01:54:01,437
Very true.

1808
01:54:01,810 --> 01:54:03,520
The next time we meet,

1809
01:54:04,062 --> 01:54:06,062
only one of us will
walk away alive.

1810
01:54:22,560 --> 01:54:24,685
Move back.

1811
01:54:32,935 --> 01:54:34,520
SP Adil Khan...

1812
01:54:35,103 --> 01:54:36,560
Why don't you say anything?

1813
01:54:37,020 --> 01:54:38,595
Who is Azad? Why is he
taking the responsibility?

1814
01:54:38,685 --> 01:54:39,888
You have to answer,

1815
01:54:39,978 --> 01:54:41,138
this is a shocking incident.

1816
01:54:41,228 --> 01:54:43,305
Is the crime getting
out of police's control? - Sir.

1817
01:54:43,395 --> 01:54:45,347
Who is this new menace? - Sir,
is it an insult for the police?

1818
01:54:45,437 --> 01:54:46,685
Azad?

1819
01:54:47,603 --> 01:54:48,853
Sir, please tell us.

1820
01:54:50,478 --> 01:54:52,103
'Police dog'

1821
01:54:52,935 --> 01:54:54,935
This? - These are files
of all the suspects.

1822
01:54:56,728 --> 01:54:59,478
You must have videos of arrests
and interrogation. - Yes, ma'am.

1823
01:54:59,810 --> 01:55:00,728
Get them.

1824
01:55:05,145 --> 01:55:06,560
Fast forward it.
- Yes, ma'am.

1825
01:55:08,228 --> 01:55:09,013
Wait a minute.

1826
01:55:09,103 --> 01:55:11,270
Yes.
- This is the wrong disc, ma'am.

1827
01:55:11,853 --> 01:55:13,430
'Sir, we are in the Ratobadi area.'

1828
01:55:13,520 --> 01:55:15,180
'We have run out of petrol.'

1829
01:55:15,270 --> 01:55:16,763
Play it.
- Yes.

1830
01:55:16,853 --> 01:55:18,560
'This is...'

1831
01:55:18,728 --> 01:55:20,513
This is the People's Theatre Group.

1832
01:55:20,603 --> 01:55:22,388
Ma'am, he is a Naxal too.
Escaped from the police lock-up.

1833
01:55:22,478 --> 01:55:24,810
'It might be a bit
dangerous, sir. Over.'

1834
01:55:25,560 --> 01:55:27,103
What were you thinking?

1835
01:55:28,810 --> 01:55:30,895
Rhea, please calm down.
- Kabir?

1836
01:55:31,228 --> 01:55:33,347
I mean, we both love him
so much, but,

1837
01:55:33,437 --> 01:55:35,728
he is like a wild horse!

1838
01:55:36,062 --> 01:55:37,643
Who knows it better than you?

1839
01:55:37,978 --> 01:55:41,062
Yet you made him your informer
and sent him amongst Naxals?

1840
01:55:41,478 --> 01:55:43,437
What were you thinking, Adil?
- I don't know, Rhea.

1841
01:55:44,643 --> 01:55:45,895
I don't know what I was thinking.

1842
01:55:47,020 --> 01:55:48,478
It was his idea.

1843
01:55:49,643 --> 01:55:51,145
I know, I should've said no,

1844
01:55:52,062 --> 01:55:53,685
but I never expected

1845
01:55:54,437 --> 01:55:55,978
Kabir to turn against me.

1846
01:55:56,478 --> 01:55:58,978
I mean, he is my best friend.
- He was your best friend, Adil!

1847
01:55:59,810 --> 01:56:01,728
Today he is your biggest enemy.

1848
01:56:02,062 --> 01:56:03,560
This is your double tragedy.

1849
01:56:05,020 --> 01:56:07,810
Jesus Christ!
You've created a monster.

1850
01:56:08,478 --> 01:56:10,312
God knows what he'll do next.

1851
01:56:15,643 --> 01:56:16,853
Stop!

1852
01:56:21,187 --> 01:56:22,353
Let them go.

1853
01:56:46,437 --> 01:56:48,145
Go... Go...

1854
01:57:12,770 --> 01:57:14,062
Rajan!

1855
01:57:24,935 --> 01:57:27,103
We are all equally concerned
about this, Mr Mahanta.

1856
01:57:27,520 --> 01:57:29,478
Believe me,
the government is with you.

1857
01:57:30,145 --> 01:57:32,145
We will leave no stone unturned.

1858
01:57:32,312 --> 01:57:34,935
You...
- I want Aditya, Chief Minister.

1859
01:57:35,935 --> 01:57:38,138
If anything happens to my son...

1860
01:57:38,228 --> 01:57:39,520
Nothing will happen to him.

1861
01:57:39,810 --> 01:57:41,312
We'll use everything in our power.

1862
01:57:41,685 --> 01:57:44,853
Nobody can stop your project.
- To hell with the project!

1863
01:57:45,810 --> 01:57:47,685
I won't setup my project.

1864
01:57:47,895 --> 01:57:49,347
Remember,

1865
01:57:49,437 --> 01:57:51,560
if my son doesn't come back,

1866
01:57:51,978 --> 01:57:55,097
no investor will ever invest
in this country again.

1867
01:57:55,187 --> 01:57:56,888
Don't say that, sir...

1868
01:57:56,978 --> 01:57:59,895
'Azad, the man-in-charge
after Rajan's arrest'

1869
01:58:00,270 --> 01:58:02,138
'talks to the media
for the first time.'

1870
01:58:02,228 --> 01:58:04,395
'We're taking you live
to the location.'

1871
01:58:04,935 --> 01:58:07,103
'Nothing will happen
to Aditya Mahanta'

1872
01:58:07,228 --> 01:58:09,062
' as long as our demands are met.'

1873
01:58:09,728 --> 01:58:11,810
'We have a single-point demand.'

1874
01:58:12,353 --> 01:58:14,810
'Release our Comrade Rajan'

1875
01:58:15,020 --> 01:58:16,930
'and we'll return the boy
safe and sound.'

1876
01:58:17,020 --> 01:58:19,312
'What if the government
refuses your demands?'

1877
01:58:19,728 --> 01:58:21,763
'Then the government will be
responsible for the consequences.'

1878
01:58:21,853 --> 01:58:23,638
'But will the police agree
to release Rajan?'

1879
01:58:23,728 --> 01:58:25,263
'Then you might demand
other things.'

1880
01:58:25,353 --> 01:58:27,222
'These are pressure tactics.
- This is pure blackmail.'

1881
01:58:27,312 --> 01:58:28,770
'Do you have...
- Just a minute!'

1882
01:58:29,187 --> 01:58:30,603
'This is not a press conference.'

1883
01:58:30,895 --> 01:58:32,145
'No questions please.'

1884
01:58:32,770 --> 01:58:34,978
'We have no personal enmity
with the police.'

1885
01:58:36,270 --> 01:58:38,853
'Just stop preaching
development to us.'

1886
01:58:43,395 --> 01:58:45,888
Hello.
- 'Sir, it's the DGP.'

1887
01:58:45,978 --> 01:58:48,388
'Getting Suryavanshi released,
Aditya Mahanta...'

1888
01:58:48,478 --> 01:58:49,853
Hello?
- Adil,

1889
01:58:51,103 --> 01:58:53,810
the government has decided
to release Rajan.

1890
01:58:54,187 --> 01:58:55,437
No, sir.

1891
01:58:56,145 --> 01:58:57,603
This will be a huge mistake, sir.

1892
01:58:58,145 --> 01:58:59,228
Please don't do this.

1893
01:58:59,395 --> 01:59:01,805
Sir, whatever we have
achieved till date

1894
01:59:01,895 --> 01:59:04,187
will be laid waste.
- Adil, try to...

1895
01:59:04,728 --> 01:59:07,270
Enough is enough, Khan.
It's the government's decision.

1896
01:59:07,520 --> 01:59:08,935
'We cannot take any more risk.'

1897
01:59:09,478 --> 01:59:11,520
Secure the release of
Aditya Mahanta.

1898
01:59:11,978 --> 01:59:14,055
There should be no mistakes.

1899
01:59:14,145 --> 01:59:16,020
'Do you get it?'

1900
01:59:18,187 --> 01:59:19,347
'The one who responded quickly'

1901
01:59:19,437 --> 01:59:21,685
'was area commander Azad.'

1902
01:59:24,187 --> 01:59:26,020
I have him deeply sedated.
- Okay.

1903
01:59:32,978 --> 01:59:34,603
This is your responsibility, ma'am.

1904
01:59:34,978 --> 01:59:37,685
This chip can cause
infection and be fatal.

1905
02:00:34,728 --> 02:00:41,560
"My heart is sad.
My friend abandoned."

1906
02:00:43,895 --> 02:00:50,020
"It cries,
my friend is upset."

1907
02:00:52,145 --> 02:00:58,228
"My heart is sad.
My friend abandoned."

1908
02:01:00,685 --> 02:01:06,643
"It cries,
my friend is upset."

1909
02:01:07,437 --> 02:01:11,805
"Be generous, oh Allah."

1910
02:01:11,895 --> 02:01:16,055
"Have mercy, oh Allah."

1911
02:01:16,145 --> 02:01:20,388
"Be generous, oh Allah."

1912
02:01:20,478 --> 02:01:25,270
"Have mercy, oh Allah."

1913
02:01:26,728 --> 02:01:30,560
"Our abode is left behind."

1914
02:01:31,103 --> 02:01:36,263
"Our own have robbed us."

1915
02:01:36,353 --> 02:01:37,638
"Oh Allah."

1916
02:01:37,728 --> 02:01:41,845
"Be generous, oh Allah."

1917
02:01:41,935 --> 02:01:45,853
"Have mercy, oh Allah."

1918
02:01:46,312 --> 02:01:50,353
"Be generous, oh Allah."

1919
02:01:50,520 --> 02:01:53,560
"Have mercy, oh Allah."

1920
02:01:54,020 --> 02:01:56,437
"Be generous, oh Allah."

1921
02:01:58,560 --> 02:02:00,810
Do you really want me
to publish this?

1922
02:02:02,520 --> 02:02:03,643
Yes,

1923
02:02:04,560 --> 02:02:05,810
but remember,

1924
02:02:06,187 --> 02:02:08,437
you got this from an
anonymous source, not me.

1925
02:02:09,187 --> 02:02:11,395
Understand?
- I understand very well.

1926
02:02:11,895 --> 02:02:13,187
This is front page news.

1927
02:02:13,728 --> 02:02:17,103
If I could get a photo of the two
of you, it'd make super hit news.

1928
02:02:28,895 --> 02:02:30,270
Thank you, sir.

1929
02:02:39,270 --> 02:02:41,560
The fever has reduced.

1930
02:02:52,228 --> 02:02:53,643
You!

1931
02:02:55,062 --> 02:02:57,353
What are you doing?
- Shut up, you scoundrel!

1932
02:02:59,395 --> 02:03:00,895
What's happening, Juhi?

1933
02:03:04,810 --> 02:03:06,520
'New Maoist leader Azad
is SP Adil Khan's friend'

1934
02:03:12,853 --> 02:03:14,728
So, this is your real face?

1935
02:03:15,145 --> 02:03:17,560
Bloody traitor!

1936
02:03:22,978 --> 02:03:24,560
'Dainik Bhaskar'

1937
02:03:29,895 --> 02:03:31,560
Is this true?

1938
02:03:33,770 --> 02:03:36,437
Sir... - Is it true that Adil Khan
is your friend?

1939
02:03:36,560 --> 02:03:38,895
That he sent you here?

1940
02:03:45,728 --> 02:03:47,930
You mean to say, this man,

1941
02:03:48,020 --> 02:03:50,228
this monster,

1942
02:03:50,853 --> 02:03:53,643
who killed Madhav Rao
and 5 other cops,

1943
02:03:53,895 --> 02:03:56,478
who kidnapped Aditya Mahanta,

1944
02:03:56,978 --> 02:03:58,810
is your man?
- Yes, sir.

1945
02:03:59,603 --> 02:04:02,895
You have hammered
the last nail in the coffin

1946
02:04:03,520 --> 02:04:06,020
of whatever little respect was
left for the police in Nandighat.

1947
02:04:06,560 --> 02:04:09,020
You have turned our anti-Naxal
operation into a joke!

1948
02:04:09,520 --> 02:04:11,853
There is only one reason
for revealing the truth.

1949
02:04:12,478 --> 02:04:15,810
Naxals never spare traitors.

1950
02:04:16,228 --> 02:04:17,470
Kabir is my best friend.

1951
02:04:17,560 --> 02:04:19,895
I know when he decides something,
nobody can stop him.

1952
02:04:21,270 --> 02:04:22,978
This is the only way to finish him.

1953
02:04:23,395 --> 02:04:25,353
That's why I leaked this news.

1954
02:04:26,103 --> 02:04:29,103
After that, I'm ready for
any action you want to take.

1955
02:04:29,603 --> 02:04:30,895
Sir...

1956
02:04:33,062 --> 02:04:34,810
As a result of your conspiracy,

1957
02:04:35,103 --> 02:04:37,853
Comrade Shivram,
Comrade Chakravarthy,

1958
02:04:38,195 --> 02:04:41,643
16 other revolutionaries and
many innocents lost their lives.

1959
02:04:42,853 --> 02:04:44,770
I didn't know that

1960
02:04:45,560 --> 02:04:47,560
the police would open fire
at the training camp.

1961
02:04:47,770 --> 02:04:49,478
What did you think?

1962
02:04:49,853 --> 02:04:52,935
On receiving your tip the police
would come to us with garlands?

1963
02:04:53,810 --> 02:04:55,400
We gave you shelter,

1964
02:04:56,020 --> 02:04:57,770
trusted you completely,

1965
02:04:58,770 --> 02:05:00,560
loved you as one of us, and you...

1966
02:05:01,603 --> 02:05:03,810
And you kept stabbing us
in the back!

1967
02:05:08,145 --> 02:05:10,437
It is true that
I came in as his man.

1968
02:05:11,062 --> 02:05:13,770
But, when I realised
what your fight is about,

1969
02:05:14,395 --> 02:05:16,643
when I got to know you,
I had a change of heart.

1970
02:05:17,685 --> 02:05:19,520
I abandoned Adil's mission.

1971
02:05:19,935 --> 02:05:21,853
That is precisely why he
leaked this news to the press

1972
02:05:22,312 --> 02:05:23,763
to break our unity.

1973
02:05:23,853 --> 02:05:26,478
How do we know that
this is not another trick?

1974
02:05:26,770 --> 02:05:28,935
What trick, Balu?

1975
02:05:29,478 --> 02:05:32,437
I kidnapped Mahanta's son
to free Rajan.

1976
02:05:32,603 --> 02:05:34,145
Adil is punishing me for that.

1977
02:05:35,228 --> 02:05:38,180
He knows there will be
a public trial

1978
02:05:38,270 --> 02:05:39,935
and in the presence
of all comrades...

1979
02:05:49,437 --> 02:05:52,395
The police are here!
Everybody leave.

1980
02:05:53,685 --> 02:05:55,437
Police!

1981
02:06:00,228 --> 02:06:02,643
Run... Run...

1982
02:06:03,685 --> 02:06:06,145
Run... Run...

1983
02:06:07,103 --> 02:06:10,103
Run... Run...
- No!

1984
02:06:11,560 --> 02:06:14,560
Run... Run...

1985
02:06:16,895 --> 02:06:17,895
No!

1986
02:06:19,685 --> 02:06:21,728
Somebody please untie him!

1987
02:06:21,853 --> 02:06:24,187
Help him!
- I will hold them.

1988
02:06:24,312 --> 02:06:26,228
All of you, move out of this place!

1989
02:06:28,560 --> 02:06:29,853
Start firing!

1990
02:06:34,560 --> 02:06:36,103
Come on!

1991
02:06:39,770 --> 02:06:41,187
Ma'am, the target is moving.

1992
02:06:41,770 --> 02:06:43,228
Ma'am, the target is moving.

1993
02:06:49,978 --> 02:06:51,395
Where's the helicopter headed?

1994
02:06:53,062 --> 02:06:54,103
How do they know?

1995
02:07:09,353 --> 02:07:11,728
Adil, the dot is moving,
they are trying to shift Rajan.

1996
02:07:12,020 --> 02:07:13,643
They are headed in the
south-west direction.

1997
02:07:15,437 --> 02:07:16,478
Okay.

1998
02:07:18,103 --> 02:07:19,103
This way.

1999
02:07:26,728 --> 02:07:28,145
Stop!

2000
02:07:34,353 --> 02:07:35,437
What is it?

2001
02:07:36,228 --> 02:07:37,845
What are you doing?

2002
02:07:37,935 --> 02:07:39,062
Just a minute.

2003
02:07:39,603 --> 02:07:40,888
They can't see you,

2004
02:07:40,978 --> 02:07:43,895
but still they know
which way you're headed.

2005
02:08:24,020 --> 02:08:26,520
This chip was revealing
your location to Adil.

2006
02:08:26,770 --> 02:08:28,470
I will lead the police
in the other direction.

2007
02:08:28,560 --> 02:08:29,763
You escape from here.

2008
02:08:29,853 --> 02:08:33,145
How'll you stop them all alone?
- Sir, don't worry about me.

2009
02:08:33,685 --> 02:08:35,978
It is important for Rajan
and you to survive.

2010
02:08:36,312 --> 02:08:39,145
The two of you can create
thousands of other comrades.

2011
02:08:40,728 --> 02:08:43,603
Azad, no matter how you began,

2012
02:08:44,228 --> 02:08:46,810
your end will be that
of a revolutionary.

2013
02:08:48,728 --> 02:08:50,228
Comrade...

2014
02:08:55,103 --> 02:08:57,020
Lal Salam.
- Lal Salam.

2015
02:08:57,228 --> 02:09:02,353
"This is our land."
- Kabir...

2016
02:09:03,560 --> 02:09:05,560
The chip is moving in the
opposite direction.

2017
02:09:06,187 --> 02:09:07,437
Let's go down.

2018
02:09:11,062 --> 02:09:12,972
He is running fast with Rajan.

2019
02:09:13,062 --> 02:09:14,305
'They changed their direction.'

2020
02:09:14,395 --> 02:09:16,062
'Adil,
he is moving south east now.'

2021
02:09:47,103 --> 02:09:48,145
Kabir!

2022
02:09:52,395 --> 02:09:53,437
Kabir!

2023
02:09:54,187 --> 02:09:55,312
Stop!

2024
02:10:03,062 --> 02:10:03,978
Sir!

2025
02:10:20,478 --> 02:10:21,728
Hey!

2026
02:10:43,437 --> 02:10:45,728
Kabir!

2027
02:10:51,935 --> 02:10:52,853
Juhi!

2028
02:11:16,270 --> 02:11:17,895
Come on!

2029
02:11:35,437 --> 02:11:36,770
Get up.

2030
02:11:41,353 --> 02:11:42,228
Okay, sir!

2031
02:11:51,685 --> 02:11:52,603
Juhi...

2032
02:11:54,228 --> 02:11:55,270
Juhi?

2033
02:12:03,437 --> 02:12:04,643
Juhi!

2034
02:12:08,685 --> 02:12:09,603
Juhi...

2035
02:12:17,685 --> 02:12:19,353
God damn it, Kabir!

2036
02:12:20,520 --> 02:12:21,520
Why?

2037
02:12:21,935 --> 02:12:22,935
Why?

2038
02:12:23,728 --> 02:12:25,103
Why did you do all this?

2039
02:12:25,560 --> 02:12:27,395
What did you get out of it?

2040
02:12:28,353 --> 02:12:30,560
It was my fault that
I let you go in.

2041
02:12:31,560 --> 02:12:34,353
But you?
You supported these people?

2042
02:12:37,312 --> 02:12:38,312
Come on now.

2043
02:12:40,228 --> 02:12:41,312
No.

2044
02:12:42,103 --> 02:12:43,478
No, Kabir.

2045
02:12:57,935 --> 02:12:59,895
No! Kabir!

2046
02:13:02,603 --> 02:13:03,560
No!

2047
02:13:04,728 --> 02:13:05,935
Kabir, don't do this.

2048
02:13:35,145 --> 02:13:37,353
Kabir...

2049
02:13:40,353 --> 02:13:41,312
Why?

2050
02:13:41,895 --> 02:13:43,062
Why did you do this?

2051
02:13:45,685 --> 02:13:47,685
What happened?

2052
02:13:49,395 --> 02:13:50,270
I...

2053
02:13:50,560 --> 02:13:51,520
I...

2054
02:13:51,810 --> 02:13:52,935
Whatever I did,

2055
02:13:54,395 --> 02:13:57,520
I have no regrets.

2056
02:14:02,560 --> 02:14:04,603
I'm only sorry about one thing

2057
02:14:06,062 --> 02:14:09,478
that I hurt you.

2058
02:14:11,478 --> 02:14:13,728
No, it was all my fault.

2059
02:14:14,685 --> 02:14:16,145
I should've never sent you.

2060
02:14:17,437 --> 02:14:18,478
Never.

2061
02:14:20,437 --> 02:14:21,520
You'll be alright.

2062
02:14:21,935 --> 02:14:23,187
Sorry, Kabir.

2063
02:14:25,020 --> 02:14:26,020
Kabir?

2064
02:14:36,560 --> 02:14:38,470
'Kabir and Juhi's martyrdom

2065
02:14:38,560 --> 02:14:41,560
gave fuel to Govind and Rajan's
struggle even more.'

2066
02:14:42,353 --> 02:14:43,888
'The rapidly growing Naxal movement

2067
02:14:43,978 --> 02:14:47,437
is deeply entrenched in more than
200 districts of India.'

2068
02:14:48,395 --> 02:14:50,478
'Thousands of armed
Maoist guerilla troops'

2069
02:14:50,603 --> 02:14:52,222
'are engaged in a bloody war'

2070
02:14:52,312 --> 02:14:54,685
'with Indian Military forces.'

2071
02:14:55,437 --> 02:14:58,062
'Not a day goes past
when Indian soil'

2072
02:14:58,270 --> 02:15:00,643
'is not soaked by the blood
of its own children.'

2073
02:15:01,520 --> 02:15:04,685
'Why can't we find a way out
of this quagmire?'

2074
02:15:05,643 --> 02:15:07,020
'In 65 years of our independence,'

2075
02:15:07,145 --> 02:15:08,978
'we achieved progress
at a fast pace,'

2076
02:15:09,228 --> 02:15:12,103
'but, at the same pace,
majority of the population'

2077
02:15:12,312 --> 02:15:13,935
'was left far behind.'

2078
02:15:15,187 --> 02:15:17,062
'The truth about
brighter India is that'

2079
02:15:17,270 --> 02:15:19,437
'one-fourth of India's wealth'

2080
02:15:19,770 --> 02:15:21,728
'is hoarded by
a mere 100 families.'

2081
02:15:22,020 --> 02:15:24,180
'Whereas, 75% of the population is'

2082
02:15:24,270 --> 02:15:27,437
'forced to survive on less than
Rs 20 a day.'

2083
02:15:28,685 --> 02:15:32,145
'The mistrust arising out this gap,
is increasing.'

2084
02:15:32,728 --> 02:15:36,020
'And perhaps, time is slipping away
from our hands.'

2085
02:15:36,437 --> 02:15:42,470
"This is our land."

2086
02:15:42,560 --> 02:15:48,520
"We were born here."

2087
02:15:50,685 --> 02:15:56,978
"We will live here."

2088
02:15:57,603 --> 02:16:03,770
"We will die here."

2089
02:16:05,560 --> 02:16:13,935
"There is no value of anyone."
