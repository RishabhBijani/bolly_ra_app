1
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,960
<i>I am 40 years old.</i>

2
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:06,680
<i>Normally at this age
in one's life, there comes a big twist.</i>

3
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,520
<i>There came a twist even in my life.</i>

4
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,040
<i>I mean, really big.</i>

5
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,520
<i>One that changed my life.</i>

6
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,160
<i>Actually, let's start
at the very beginning.</i>

7
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,280
<i>Since I was a kid I have been living
in this house with my</i>

8
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,520
<i>grandpa, grandma, mother and father.</i>

9
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,520
<i>My parents passed away when
I was eight years old.</i>

10
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,360
<i>My grandparents took care
of my upbringing.</i>

11
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,040
<i>When I was a child
I was very cute.</i>

12
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,400
<i>People would pull my cheeks and say...</i>

13
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,600
So sweet!

14
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,760
{\an8}<i>And this sweetness was even running
in my grandpa's business.</i>

15
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,600
{\an8}<i>Y. Y. Confectioners</i>

16
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,760
{\an8}<i>In Mumbai, the outlets of our shop
surpassed the greenery.</i>

17
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,400
{\an8}Please pack samosas
and half a kilo of <i>Jalebis</i>, brother.

18
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,520
Brother!

19
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,840
Y. Y. Confectioners!

20
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,160
{\an8}<i>My grandpa always interfered
in my love life.</i>

21
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,919
<i>At times he would call</i>

22
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,200
{\an8}<i>and at times he himself
would show up in person.</i>

23
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,160
{\an8}<i>I never had a relationship
so, clearly marriage was out of question.</i>

24
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,400
Six!

25
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,320
{\an8}Did you see, Rahul?
Sachin plays so amazingly.

26
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,440
{\an8}<i>Though my grandpa was a die hard fan
of Sachin Tendulkar...</i>

27
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,640
{\an8}<i>he never applied the word "die"
in his life.</i>

28
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,480
<i>Time passed on but he did not.</i>

29
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,760
<i>All my relatives settled abroad.</i>

30
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,760
<i>And then, it was 2013.</i>

31
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,600
{\an8}<i>My grandpa's 100th birthday!</i>

32
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:42,960
{\an8}<i>All of my relatives gathered and,
even the two tragedies of my life came.</i>

33
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,520
{\an8}<i>My two friends, Bobby and Salim.</i>

34
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,560
{\an8}Once you reach there
don't be naughty at forty!

35
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,240
{\an8}And both of you, mind your own business!

36
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:56,320
{\an8}- Tanu, help me with the decorations.
- One second.

37
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,680
{\an8}What are you two planning to do?

38
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,680
{\an8}Not just the two, it includes all of us.

39
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,080
{\an8}Rahul, although it's grandpa's birthday,
we have a gift for you.

40
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,840
Hot NRI women!

41
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,200
{\an8}I've already spoken to them.

42
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,040
{\an8}We'll be with them in Goa for
six days and seven nights.

43
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,200
{\an8}What sort of friends are you?
For a week!

44
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,720
How will grandpa let me go for a week?

45
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:17,880
I'll be back.

46
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,840
He's an idiot!

47
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,360
{\an8}- You are also an idiot...
<i>- Rahul...</i>

48
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,920
{\an8}Come here.

49
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,200
{\an8}Grandpa.

50
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,400
{\an8}Sir, you come with me.

51
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,760
{\an8}Yes, Grandpa.

52
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,440
{\an8}Did you bring me a gift?

53
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,640
{\an8}You haven't yet opened the gifts given by
Vimal, Renu and the others.

54
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,920
{\an8}They are others', not ours.

55
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,000
I am going to be 100 years old.

56
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,720
I will say wise things.

57
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,040
{\an8}They like me because we're related.

58
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,520
{\an8}You love me which is why we are related!

59
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:57,320
{\an8}I wonder what will happen
to you once I'd be gone.

60
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,400
No, Grandpa...

61
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,480
{\an8}Here we go! I've also begun
to talk about dying.

62
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,440
{\an8}Well, I am still young.

63
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,840
{\an8}Why should we talk about what is
to happen 20 to 25 years later?

64
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,280
Come on, show it to me.

65
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,240
A bat autographed by Sachin!

66
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,920
{\an8}Come on, hit!

67
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:29,200
{\an8}Grandpa, Rahul is thinking to open up
a franchise of your shop in Goa.

68
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,360
Yes, go ahead and open it.

69
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,600
{\an8}Why is he playing like this?

70
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,480
{\an8}Grandpa, we have already seen
an amazing plot in Panjim.

71
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,360
{\an8}Grandpa, can we go with Rahul
to finalize the plot?

72
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,040
- Go!
- Okay.

73
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,720
{\an8}Come on, Sachin!
Hit it beyond the boundary!

74
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,520
Six! Sachin is on 99.

75
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,200
{\an8}Hey, old woman.
Look, Sachin is on 99.

76
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,840
{\an8}Oh, Grandma!
Such excitement for a century!

77
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,880
It's just a game.
He will make it again.

78
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,640
Grandpa!

79
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,760
<i>Both grandpa and Sachin
were knocked out at 99!</i>

80
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,120
<i>It was a strange feeling.</i>

81
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,200
<i>But then I read that...</i>

82
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,360
<i>a person's death is already
predestined before his birth.</i>

83
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,720
{\an8}<i>I thought to myself if what has to happen</i>

84
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,360
{\an8}<i>has already happened then
what difference does it make?</i>

85
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:44,000
{\an8}<i>After all, grandpa lived since the era of
All India Radio to the advent of Twitter.</i>

86
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,960
<i>He lived a good life.</i>

87
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:46,840
<i>That's it!</i>

88
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,120
<i>At that very moment...</i>

89
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,680
<i>I had made a decision.</i>

90
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,720
Goa is on!

91
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,880
Grandma, I want to do something
more in life.

92
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,400
I want to do something
by my heart.

93
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:06,080
I cannot handle
grandpa's business anymore.

94
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:11,040
Grandma, even I have some dreams
which I've not been able to fulfill.

95
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,600
But now I want to see the world
and learn things.

96
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,920
Grandma, I really want
to live on my own terms.

97
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,640
Rahul, along with the property,
you're free to do whatever you want.

98
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,400
Live your life the way you want to,
nobody is stopping you.

99
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,400
But you will have to do me a favor.

100
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,560
Tell me, Grandma.

101
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,840
It was your grandpa's last wish...

102
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,240
that after he died...

103
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:44,160
half of his ashes should
be immersed into the Ganges...

104
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:48,120
and the other half in Rameshwaram.

105
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,240
Rameshwaram?

106
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:52,800
Yes. I will go with Anshu
and immerse his ashes into the Ganges...

107
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,120
but you will have to go to Rameshwaram
to pour the other half of his ashes.

108
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,600
Grandma, me?

109
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,280
Yes, you!

110
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:05,600
This was your grandpa's last wish.
You will have to fulfill it.

111
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,960
Rameshwaram is at the end of India!

112
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,120
That too in the exact
opposite direction of Goa!

113
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,600
One minute, guys!

114
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,760
Salim, give me that.

115
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:24,000
The waters of Goa must be flowing up
to Rameshwaram, right?

116
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,880
What do you mean?

117
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:29,760
Means if we pour out
grandpa's ashes in the waters of Goa...

118
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,680
It will eventually float
and reach Rameshwaram.

119
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,840
Yes, but Goa and Rameshwaram
are miles away.

120
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,200
Oh, we are going to make
them coincide!

121
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,760
Which means...

122
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,440
Goa is on!

123
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,680
Yes, Rahul.

124
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,720
<i>Bobby, change of plan.</i>

125
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,080
What? You're coming to Goa, right?

126
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,400
Of course, I'm coming.

127
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,480
But to fool grandma we have
to begin our journey by train.

128
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,800
What?

129
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,680
Grandma is going to come to see me off.

130
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,120
So in the next two hours I'll buy a
ticket of any train going to South India.

131
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,760
I will get on the train,
and I will get off at Kalyan.

132
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:04,160
You guys wait for me there,
we will travel by road from there.

133
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,360
Which means, Goa is on!

134
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,080
Let's go, grandpa.

135
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,560
Chennai Express?

136
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,480
Yes, Chennai Express.

137
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:33,559
As much as I know, I don't think
Chennai Express goes to Rameshwaram.

138
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,440
You did not understand.

139
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:40,320
Didn't I tell you that I want
to spend more time with grandpa?

140
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,520
So I am taking the long route
not the wrong route.

141
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:48,040
I will get off at Chennai
and take the road to Rameshwaram.

142
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:48,920
Rahul...

143
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,360
Do you know why am I taking your
grandpa's ashes to the Ganges?

144
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,720
It's because I don't trust anyone here.

145
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:02,800
But I have complete faith...

146
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:09,640
that you'll immerse your grandpa's ashes
in the waters of Rameshwaram.

147
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:24,000
<i>I did not like lying to grandma.</i>

148
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,960
<i>But by then, I had already done that.</i>

149
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,240
Where are you, Rahul?
We have already reached Kalyan.

150
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,320
Yes, I just took the train
after bidding farewell to grandma.

151
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,440
I will be reaching shortly.

152
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,600
Rahul has arrived.

153
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,720
Rahul, where were you?

154
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,560
I've come, right?

155
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,520
- It's going to be fun!
- Yes!

156
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,360
- Ash!
- What happened?

157
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,000
The ashes!

158
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:12,880
Grandpa's ash!

159
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,200
Rahul...

160
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,440
Rahul, listen to us!

161
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,960
I've done this before.

162
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,560
Actually... Sorry, I have to go.

163
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,240
Meenamma, what did you think?

164
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,200
That you could get away from us?

165
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,680
What you are doing is totally wrong!

166
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,240
Don't try to preach to us.

167
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,640
What are you guys fighting about?

168
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,800
People miss trains and because of
you people I missed my platform.

169
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,880
Meenamma.

170
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,560
Please relax. Don't be upset.

171
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:59,320
<i>Chennai express</i>

172
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,840
That's my seat.

173
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,840
I'll take off the bag. Nonsense.

174
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,800
Rahul, where are you?

175
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,040
I am in the train.

176
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,000
In the train?

177
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,880
I didn't have the chance to get out.

178
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,880
So, this is what we are going to do...

179
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,040
<i>We will meet at Karjat Station.</i>

180
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,280
And listen...

181
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,480
Don't worry about me.

182
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,640
I've got great company.

183
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,560
So, you finally found her?

184
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,520
Yes, she is sitting right in front of me.

185
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,720
What hair!

186
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:03,960
What amazing eyes!

187
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,240
What lips!

188
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:08,440
You're objectifying her!
Won't she beat you?

189
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,720
She doesn't understand Hindi.

190
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,680
Hey, wait!
She's looking at me.

191
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,520
She's probably looking at me with love.

192
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,840
Make sure she's not blind.

193
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,880
But its possible that
she'll fall in love with me.

194
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:28,000
Listen, let's meet at Karjat Station.

195
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,440
Till then I will keep myself busy here.

196
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,600
Hopefully, I should be able
to get her along.

197
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:44,480
<i>When I saw you I knew my dear</i>

198
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:51,240
<i>That love is crazy my dear</i>

199
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,800
<i>Now where do I go</i>

200
00:14:53,920 --> 00:15:00,920
<i>What makes you think I
don't understand Hindi?</i>

201
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,280
<i>The ones whom you helped</i>

202
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,560
<i>Are here to kidnap me</i>

203
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,520
Kidnap?

204
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,760
<i>We're in big trouble</i>

205
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,080
<i>So will you help?</i>

206
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,920
<i>So that they don't suspect anything...</i>

207
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:31,240
<i>Talk to me through songs</i>

208
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,720
<i>Grant me forgiveness,
For what I've done</i>

209
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,960
<i>I had no idea you knew the language</i>

210
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,080
<i>I will do as you say now</i>

211
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:47,640
<i>Since I've made a mistake,
I should pay the penalty</i>

212
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,000
<i>Don't you worry!</i>

213
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:57,080
<i>I am here!</i>

214
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,520
Meenamma.

215
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:02,920
You sing.

216
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:10,160
<i>So you go to the toilet</i>

217
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,800
<i>So you go to the toilet</i>

218
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,040
Toilet!

219
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:24,880
<i>But why are you sending me to the toilet?</i>

220
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:28,720
<i>What is it that you intend to do,
Tell me?</i>

221
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,120
Your...

222
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,720
<i>-I will use your phone to make a call
-Okay</i>

223
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,520
<i>I will inform my friends</i>

224
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:42,040
<i>Go to the toilet</i>

225
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:46,680
<i>Go to the toilet</i>

226
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,840
Toilet!

227
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,920
You must not have heard
the name before.

228
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,240
Can I make a call from this?

229
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:25,400
Of course, you can.

230
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,600
Meenamma, what did you think?

231
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,360
You would call and we
wouldn't notice?

232
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,400
That was my phone.

233
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,800
My friends are waiting at Karjat Station.
How will I contact them?

234
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,320
That was my phone.
My phone!

235
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,920
Meenamma, what is he saying?

236
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,320
It was his phone.

237
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,720
If I knew that earlier

238
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,240
I would have thrown him out
with the phone.

239
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,120
What is he saying?

240
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,200
He's saying that had they known
the phone belonged to you

241
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,480
they would throw you out
with the phone.

242
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,840
Is this your father's kingdom?

243
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:09,840
Are you trying to scare me?

244
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,960
Are you threatening me?

245
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,640
Meenamma!

246
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,960
Enough! This is too much.

247
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,520
You have made me so angry that
I will sit down.

248
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,800
And if I sit down don't think
I won't be able to stand up again.

249
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,120
And if I stand up don't think...

250
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,520
I cannot sit down again.

251
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:45,200
And I forgive you for the mobile too.

252
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,160
I can buy the entire mobile company
if I want to.

253
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:50,960
4G, 5G! I have a lot of money.

254
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,000
Poor people.

255
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,360
Brother, show me your ticket.

256
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,080
No.

257
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,600
What no?

258
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,560
If you don't have a ticket
then you will have to pay a fine.

259
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,880
I have my ticket.

260
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,680
This is a ticket.

261
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,400
If you don't have a ticket
then you will have to pay a fine.

262
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,360
From where have you boarded the train?

263
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,400
Are they with you?

264
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,880
<i>Listen to me very carefully TC</i>

265
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,840
<i>Don't take it easy on these hooligans</i>

266
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:49,920
<i>I swear all four of them
Are carrying long weapons</i>

267
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:56,800
<i>These four friends have abducted this girl
And taking her very far</i>

268
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,840
<i>Very carefully</i>

269
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,720
Come on, get up.

270
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,760
Come with me.

271
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,640
Come on.

272
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:15,000
Now you will be in trouble.

273
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,680
You can go to jail and
play ping pong!

274
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,040
You think you are King Kong?

275
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,160
What?

276
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,720
Why aren't you answering?

277
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,280
And Meenamma,
you are on my watch now.

278
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,160
The TC is on our side.

279
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,640
See how he teaches them a lesson!

280
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,320
Enough!

281
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,080
This is too much.

282
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:59,000
You all have made me so angry that now
I have to sit.

283
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,800
You sing and dance.

284
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,400
We are going by Chennai Express.

285
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:09,120
You laugh and cry.
We are going by Chennai Express.

286
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:12,960
Meenamma?

287
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:16,840
Whatever happened with the TC,
you are the solo witness to it.

288
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,760
That is why you will come with us
to Komban village on Chennai Express.

289
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,920
On Chennai Express!

290
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,440
<i>All my wishes were washed away
with the ashes.</i>

291
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:50,480
<i>I had come to Goa to immerse the ashes
but instead drowned the TC.</i>

292
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,760
<i>My friends tried
to get in touch with me.</i>

293
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,160
<i>But they could not track me down because</i>

294
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:59,200
<i>My 35,000 rupees cell phone
was lying somewhere on a railway track.</i>

295
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,520
I want to sleep.

296
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,720
You sleep.

297
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,080
Periyanna, check on the next station.

298
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,160
I am hungry.

299
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,120
Okay.

300
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,320
Meenamma...

301
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:53,760
What is happening?

302
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,520
I cannot understand a thing.

303
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,560
You are scolding your kidnappers

304
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,240
And they are listening to you!

305
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,040
I will clear your confusion.

306
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,640
My father is a highly respected man
in the Komban area.

307
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,960
He is a... You know, <i>Periyathalai</i>?

308
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,880
<i>Periyathalai?</i> You mean teacher?

309
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,520
No.

310
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,200
Don.

311
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:34,240
These four are listening
to my <i>pechi</i> because...

312
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,200
<i>Pechi?</i>

313
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,360
- Chatter.
- Chatter! Oh, I get it.

314
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,600
So they were listening to me because
they're my father's goons.

315
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,600
Goons?

316
00:23:56,120 --> 00:24:01,200
My father asked them to kidnap me
and bring me back to Komban.

317
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,680
That means your father
is Godfather of the South.

318
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,240
And he wants my <i>Kalyanam</i> to be done.

319
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,400
Kal...

320
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:11,800
With Tangaballi.

321
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,720
Yes, that is why I ran away!

322
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:16,880
I didn't understand.

323
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,480
Tangaballi is my father's friend's son.

324
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,880
If I marry him then my father will
own his friend's village.

325
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,240
That's why my father wants
to get me married.

326
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,920
Did you understand
the entire situation?

327
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,520
No.

328
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,000
No.

329
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:55,640
It's your father, your goons,
your marriage! What's my fault?

330
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,560
The problem is yours, your kidnapping

331
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,680
that village is also yours
and it's my neck on the line?

332
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,480
That means, what is yours is mine?

333
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,400
No, Meenamma.

334
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,800
People fly kites in the air! Your goons
throw mobiles and TCs in the air!

335
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,040
I was happily going to Goa.

336
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,960
Goa is on! But no!

337
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,560
Take the Chennai Express!

338
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:25,920
I am ruined!

339
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,920
<i>I thought of running away at night</i>

340
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:36,040
<i>When I opened my
eyes in the morning...</i>

341
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:41,760
Will you have some <i>Idli</i>?

342
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,640
No.

343
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,200
I need to go.

344
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,880
- Will you eat?
- No, I'll go.

345
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,200
Why is he not eating <i>Idli</i>?

346
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,440
Inspector Sir...

347
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,200
Periya.

348
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,160
What, officer?

349
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,760
Did you hear the
sound of this chicken?

350
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,240
What did he say?

351
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,240
He said...

352
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,240
Have you ever heard chickens?

353
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,880
??

354
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,640
Check if there anything to eat?

355
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:40,840
Okay.

356
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,160
Meenamma.

357
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:46,040
That policeman instead of
helping me, he...

358
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,040
From here the entire region
belongs to my father.

359
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,000
Even the policemen here takes
my father's help.

360
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,000
What do you mean?

361
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:57,440
It means that no one can do anything
to these four.

362
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,800
That means from here
anything can happen to me?

363
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:00,920
Yes.

364
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,400
- Means I could even lose my life here?
- Yes

365
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,520
What are you agreeing on?

366
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,160
You should never tell
a dying person that he's about to die.

367
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,760
At least give me some sort
of false hope that I will be safe.

368
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,960
You can be saved.

369
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,720
Now my ashes will also be immersed
as that of grandpa's.

370
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,720
I don't know why did I give you my hand!

371
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,800
You gave me your hand?

372
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,920
In a bid to save myself I was running.
Why did you help them?

373
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,120
Had I known that
your brothers were goons

374
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,360
I would have kicked them instead
of helping them.

375
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,880
Anyway, you are the root cause
of this entire problem.

376
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,960
Ever since you've come into my life,
my life sucks!

377
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,680
Why have you come to me?

378
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:48,080
You came on my side!

379
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,640
Forget about sides, Meenamma.
Come to the point.

380
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,240
Is there any way for the two of us
to get out? Tell me, please!

381
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,000
- Please!
- Yes, there is.

382
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,840
What is it? Please tell me.

383
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,120
But you will have to do as I say.

384
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,760
As if everything was going
my way till now.

385
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,120
I'll do it.
Tell me what has to be done?

386
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,880
Once we reach Komban,
in front of my father...

387
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,840
whenever I look towards you,
just nod your head.

388
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,200
Nod what?

389
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:19,560
Head.

390
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,920
What?

391
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,840
Nod my head.

392
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,880
Nod my head.

393
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,600
I will eat <i>idli</i>, <i>dosa</i>.
I will nod my head.

394
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,120
I will eat <i>dosa</i>...

395
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,200
Take the Chennai Express.

396
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,040
Hey, Chinna.

397
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,800
We reached. Come!

398
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,040
Let's go.

399
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:01,000
What are you doing, brother?
Meenamma, why did he pull the chain?

400
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,320
When we arrive at our village,
we pull the chain.

401
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:11,520
We decide where the train station is.

402
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,680
Come on!

403
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,520
Come?

404
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,480
Hey! Move on.

405
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,160
Who is this?

406
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:19,840
My father.

407
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:57,160
How many times will you try to escape?

408
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,280
Why are you doing this?
For what?

409
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:04,560
I don't want to marry Tangaballi...

410
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,200
<i>Meena was making her
father understand, emotionally.</i>

411
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,560
<i>Her father was shocked
with what Meena was saying.</i>

412
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,800
I am in love with somebody.

413
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,320
Who is he?

414
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,720
- <i>And I was...</i>
- Him.

415
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,200
<i>And I was as clueless as you all are.</i>

416
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,960
He loves me too.

417
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,680
Am I right?

418
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:28,160
<i>The plan was to just nod my head.
That is why...</i>

419
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:35,000
<i>After such a reaction,
one thing was certain.</i>

420
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,440
<i>In the future, I wouldn't
be able to nod my head...</i>

421
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,800
<i>because it won't be there!</i>

422
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,120
My dear...

423
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,240
Is Tamil your mother tongue?

424
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,400
What is your father asking me
about my mother?

425
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:58,000
He's asking you
if you know Tamil.

426
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:03,720
Father, he is settled in the North.

427
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:07,120
I will teach him Tamil
after our marriage.

428
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:10,520
Meena likes this boy. Bring him.

429
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:29,199
Meenamma, I thought
they were going to kill me.

430
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,639
But your father's goons
lifted me up on their shoulders.

431
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,679
What did you say to them?

432
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,080
I just told them three lies.

433
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:37,040
You lied?

434
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,760
At least tell me
what you said, Ms Subtitle.

435
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,800
My first lie was that we are very much
in love with each other.

436
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:46,239
My second lie was that we wanted
to get married to each other.

437
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,600
That's when you nodded your head.

438
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,920
Yes, I nodded. But that...

439
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,719
So, all of them have accepted this?

440
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,760
No.

441
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,160
The plan only worked when
I told them the third lie.

442
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,040
What was that?

443
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,320
That you lived in North
since you were a child,

444
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,240
which is why you
don't know Tamil.

445
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,560
He thought my story was genuine.

446
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:08,840
That's why they're taking us
to the village to decide our future.

447
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,400
Not to decide on the future but
to destroy my future.

448
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,320
Hey, brother!

449
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,000
Think about it Rahul,
I will get married.

450
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,080
Brother!

451
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,200
At first there were four
of them running after you.

452
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,640
Now the whole village will chase you.

453
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,960
I did this drama so we could
buy some time.

454
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,440
We will run away as soon
as we get an opportunity at night.

455
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,320
Run away...

456
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,560
I have a lot of experience
in running away.

457
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:19,440
<i>Meena's family reminded me
of the population in China.</i>

458
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,520
<i>Meena began telling them the story
of Chennai Express.</i>

459
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:26,520
<i>As the story progressed, everyone seemed
to be impressed with me.</i>

460
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,800
<i>But I was depressed.</i>

461
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,200
<i>I was stressed.</i>

462
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:34,600
<i>Because the place where I had arrived
was a very dangerous one!</i>

463
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,720
<i>Everyone was treating me well.</i>

464
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,600
<i>But a goat is also well fed before
it is sacrificed!</i>

465
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,280
I've asked Bobby to get a fancy number
at times but...

466
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:02,200
<i>The numbers I was trying to call</i>

467
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,800
<i>Were all washed away from my brain.</i>

468
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:09,240
<i>The mobile technology definitely
connected us with our closed ones but...</i>

469
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:12,240
<i>It had also messed
with our heads.</i>

470
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:13,760
<i>At first when there were
no mobile phones</i>

471
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,240
<i>Then we would remember
all telephone numbers.</i>

472
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,440
<i>Now that we have a mobile phone
we don't remember any numbers!</i>

473
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,200
Meena...

474
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,680
What's the plan to get out of here?

475
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,880
Meena, don't ignore me.

476
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,360
This drama has gone on for too long,
it's quite enough now.

477
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,360
- I'm losing patience.
- Rahul.

478
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:34,920
Hello, Sir.

479
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,160
- Get him a coffee.
- Get it.

480
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:14,080
The food is ready. Call everybody.

481
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,360
Madhi, come here.

482
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,440
Rahul.

483
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,160
Rahul.

484
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,360
Oh, no!

485
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,400
Hey, you are so smart.

486
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,560
What are you jabbering in Tamil?
Talk in Hindi.

487
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,640
Hey, you are very beautiful.

488
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:44,160
You learnt Tamil in a day?

489
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,720
Meena, I am not
this sort of a guy. Please!

490
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,440
- Meena.
- Rahul.

491
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,720
- Madhi.
- Puvi.

492
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,440
They came.

493
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:04,720
We just followed them.

494
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,080
Yes.

495
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,560
Let's go.

496
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,600
Go.

497
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:20,880
What's the hurry?

498
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,720
Hey! Come.

499
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:29,800
Meena I want to get out of here.
Please do something.

500
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,320
Do?

501
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,640
Are you doing fine?
Vanakkam.

502
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,320
Singh.

503
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,240
We need to take a decision
in some of these matters.

504
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,360
A Punjabi? Here?

505
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:01,960
So we should think and
take a decision.

506
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,360
You are right.

507
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,560
But tell Meenamma that...

508
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,120
This Punjabi man is speaking in Tamil!

509
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,800
With the boy she should not...

510
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,200
Give me a minute.

511
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,480
You're Rahul, right?

512
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,120
Yes. How did you know?

513
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:23,160
It's the work of policemen,
to identify a corpse.

514
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,000
A corpse? But I am still..

515
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:27,040
If it's not been done already,
it will be done.

516
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,120
I'm in charge of this area.

517
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,440
You have a lot of guts.

518
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:44,720
Fell in love with Meena, knowing that
you'll be in the bad books of Tangaballi.

519
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,440
No, not at all.
People here have misunderstood.

520
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,800
Actually, these guys want to frame me.

521
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:51,200
You will be framed up on this wall

522
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,360
And a garland will also be placed
on your photograph.

523
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,720
Garland! No, Sir.
This is against the law.

524
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:59,520
Here you go, you should have thought
about this before falling in love!

525
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,400
Hey! Tangaballi is here.

526
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,480
Tangaballi is here!

527
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:47,680
I have heard that this time
somebody has come with Meena.

528
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,120
Yes! What can we do?

529
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:52,520
What is he saying?

530
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:53,960
Tangaballi is asking about you.

531
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,120
What is the father saying?

532
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,360
The father is saying you
are the one because...

533
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,000
of whom Meena keeps running away
from home time and again.

534
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:58,880
Oh, no!

535
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:01,160
My marriage with
Meena was already fixed.

536
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,720
You are right, my dear.

537
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:05,680
What is he saying now?

538
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:08,440
The father is saying that his first choice
for Meena is Tangaballi.

539
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:11,000
But he's helpless because Meena's
first choice is you.

540
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:12,160
- No!
- Yes!

541
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:15,680
I am not here to decide what
is right and wrong.

542
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,160
It's about my prestige!

543
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,160
Sir, what is he saying now?

544
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:23,640
The father is asking to mutually
take a decision on this matter.

545
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,280
Not him, what is the giant saying?

546
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,400
He's saying that...

547
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,440
Now it's not about right or wrong.

548
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:31,200
It's a matter of his prestige.

549
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:36,520
If it's a matter of his prestige...

550
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,040
then why is he trying
to take away mine?

551
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:41,120
Sir, don't worry.
I can handle this.

552
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:47,400
Are you the one who wants
to marry Meena?

553
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,960
- At least hear him out.
- Relax! I'll handle it.

554
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:56,560
Do you think you're a hero?

555
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:00,240
- Listen to me...
- Its okay, he is joking with me.

556
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:04,120
If you are a real man,
fight with me!

557
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,080
We'll fight tonight.

558
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:11,120
If you win, Meena is yours.

559
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,320
If I win, Meena is mine.

560
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:16,400
What do you say?

561
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:24,200
What gibberish was he talking?

562
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:26,440
Please speak up.
Don't be scared.

563
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,480
He has challenged you.

564
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,440
- What?
- You both will have a fight tonight.

565
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:31,320
- Why?
- Yes.

566
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:32,680
Whoever wins, will get Meena.

567
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:35,520
My friend, you have just
accepted the challenge!

568
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:38,920
But I don't even understand Tamil,
I just nod my head as Meena told me to.

569
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:40,800
You came here alive.

570
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:43,440
You will not leave from here alive.

571
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:48,280
I will cut you into several pieces
and parcel it.

572
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:02,320
Tingu Sir, that's what I'm saying.
Peace, love, friendship, Gandhi...

573
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,120
Why didn't you tell me
what he was saying before?

574
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:06,120
You were tickling me instead!

575
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:09,200
- Let's see.
- What?

576
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:11,480
We will see.

577
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:14,080
Who is stronger!

578
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,240
Who is stronger?

579
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:17,760
What do you mean who is stronger, Sir?

580
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,800
I am not at all strong.
Make him understand.

581
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:32,200
I know there's a little problem.

582
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:33,400
A little problem?

583
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,920
The fight has been fixed for tonight
with that TV tower Tingu.

584
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,520
And even your father wants to find out
who amongst the two of us is stronger.

585
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,320
- Strong?
- Yes, strong.

586
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:41,640
Look, Meenamma.

587
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:43,040
If I get angry...

588
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:44,280
Then what will you do Rahul?

589
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:45,280
I will commit suicide.

590
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:48,320
I'll take poison, tie a noose around my
neck and be run over by Chennai Express.

591
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:50,320
- No, Rahul.
- The train is calling me.

592
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:51,400
Rahul... Rahul!

593
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:53,920
I will make a plan to run away tonight.

594
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:56,840
Till then you remain normal.

595
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:57,720
No, I cannot remain normal.

596
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:03,920
I will plan it.

597
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:09,120
You place a time bomb inside a person
and ask them to be normal!

598
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:11,880
You must have heard that name before.

599
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:17,320
- Meenamma!
- Yes.

600
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:18,400
So many people.

601
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:20,480
They are preparing
for your fight with Tangaballi.

602
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:23,240
I know. But how are we going
to get away with so many people around?

603
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:25,560
My escape plan is ready.

604
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:26,600
It's ready? What is it?

605
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:28,920
You just go out and behave normal.

606
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:30,920
- I am normal.
- Normal.

607
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,640
- I will come in a while and signal to you.
- Okay.

608
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:35,480
Then the two of us will run away.

609
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:38,520
Till then you don't make any mistakes.

610
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,720
No mistakes.

611
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:00,520
No mistakes.

612
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:25,720
<i>Dude, where are you going?</i>

613
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:28,560
<i>You are the one for me</i>

614
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:31,160
<i>Come and hug me</i>

615
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:33,440
<i>My body craves for you</i>

616
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:36,600
Hey, he don't know Tamil.

617
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:39,040
Sing in Hindi once again.

618
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:46,440
<i>My exotic beauty</i>

619
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,280
<i>I have veiled it</i>

620
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:54,960
<i>And brought it for you,
hiding it from the world</i>

621
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:57,680
<i>I am stuck between the devil
and the deep sea</i>

622
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:00,520
<i>Will someone tell me what to do?</i>

623
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:02,680
<i>I wonder who has cursed me</i>

624
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:05,400
<i>How have I landed here</i>

625
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:08,600
<i>Don't worry,
Be happy</i>

626
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:11,160
<i>Come and groove on the beat</i>

627
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:14,000
<i>One, two, three, four
Get on the dance floor</i>

628
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:16,560
<i>One, two, three, four
Get on the dance floor</i>

629
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:18,080
<i>Booty shake, booty shake</i>

630
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:19,240
<i>Dappan goothu hard core
Let's dance hard core</i>

631
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:20,560
<i>Move your shoulders up and down</i>

632
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:21,880
<i>Move your body all around</i>

633
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,880

00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:32,760
<i>Move your body all around</i>

639
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:35,680
<i>Give me, give me
Some more</i>

640
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:38,320
<i>It's amazing, it bombards the mind
My heart is fluttering, buddy</i>

641
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:41,120
<i>Marry me my small cuckoo
I'll provide you with slaves</i>

642
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:42,360
You stabbed me here and there

643
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:43,880
<i>And now she's coming
To set you on fire</i>

644
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:46,640
<i>Just sway to the beats</i>

645
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:10,880
<i>I can sense trouble</i>

646
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:15,840
<i>There seems to be bad luck written
In my future</i>

647
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:21,200
<i>My walk is the focus
Of everyone's attention</i>

648
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:26,800
<i>Don't hide your racing heart from me,
Don't act like a saint</i>

649
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:32,480
<i>The tinkling of your ear rings
Come as a warning bell to me</i>

650
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:35,320
<i>One, two, three, four
Get on the dance floor</i>

651
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:36,680

<i>I don't care if your name is Pushpa

663
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:15,720
<i>I would rather run for my life
Than stick around with you</i>

664
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:21,080
<i>Where ever you go,
You will hear the one, two, three, four</i>

665
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:24,280
<i>One, two, three, four
Listen to it hardcore</i>

<i>All doors are closed my friend,
Talk less, dance more</i>

679
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:56,360
Hey, Meena Lochini... Sundaram!

680
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:01,280
Meena Lochini... Sundaram!

681
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:02,680
What kind of name is this?

682
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:05,840
Addresses are shorter than this name!

683
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:08,920
I had gone on a holiday,
and you took me on a trip!

684
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:13,160
No, I won't nod my head now.

685
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,160
Hey, pot King!

686
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,760
Why are you sitting on that bike
and staring at me?

687
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:23,320
I had full plans of having fun.
Because of your ashes...

688
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:25,040
I've gotten into so much trouble.

689
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:31,240
Grandpa, I had full plans to immerse
your ashes in the waters of Goa but...

690
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:33,960
You changed my entire plan!

691
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:39,360
Hey, brother!

692
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:41,640
Hold this!

693
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:48,320
You were scaring me
by showing me your gun!

694
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:51,680
Now I will also show
you something. Look!

695
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,520
Did you see?
Can you do that?

696
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,880
No?

697
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:04,400
That's because your fat
comes in between.

698
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:09,080
Fatty.

699
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:12,160
Hey, don!

700
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:17,200
You were threatening me!

701
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:18,160
Wait.

702
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:27,080
Can you do this?

703
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:29,960
No, right? Then?

704
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:37,320
Mr. Durgeshwara... Sundaram.

705
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:38,880
Tamil is not my mother tongue!

706
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:41,120
How are you, my darling?

707
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,760
You have become a referee!

708
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:45,240
You fixed a match between
Tingu and me.

709
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:47,760
Where's Tingu?

710
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:51,360
Tingu!

711
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:58,600
Hey, you humongous monster!

712
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,120
Will you fight with me?
Why?

713
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:11,880
Okay, you can fight.

714
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:14,000
But before that show me
if you can do this?

715
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:20,400
Look, Tingu. Can you do this?

716
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:41,840
Catch him.

717
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,840
Tangaballi, can you do this?

718
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:02,400
- Hey, Sir!
- Rahul.

719
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:03,400
What happened?

720
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:05,600
You and me will have some buttermilk!

721
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:07,760
Yes, we'll have some buttermilk!
Come on, get up!

722
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:08,960
Get up!

723
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:11,800
You are completely drunk.

724
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:13,680
Careful!

725
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:18,080
Don't fall again!

726
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:20,240
Careful!

727
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:22,280
Come, sit here.

728
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:23,920
Listen...

729
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:25,920
The station is on the opposite side.

730
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:28,480
Take the first train tomorrow at 5:30 a.m.
and leave. Understood?

731
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:29,360
Understood?

732
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:32,800
And don't tell anyone that
I helped you.

733
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:35,000
Yes and let it remain a secret.

734
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:36,760
Else, the entire village
will cut me into pieces.

735
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:39,160
The Almighty will take care of the rest.
Go to sleep.

736
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:00,600
Sir!

737
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:31,360
Hey! Look!

738
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:34,480
How did you come here?

739
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:35,400
From where have you come?

740
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:36,600
Where is this boat going?

741
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:38,800
Sri Lanka! Why?

742
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:40,280
To get diesel.

743
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:42,680
Have you gone mad? Why are you
going to Sri Lanka to get diesel?

744
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:47,360
We're going to Sri Lanka
with the smuggle diesel.

745
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:51,600
Everything is legal
when one has to survive.

746
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:53,280
If the Sri Lanka Marine police catch us,
we will be jailed.

747
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:55,320
If the Indian Marine police catch us,
we will be jailed here.

748
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:58,320
If police don't catch us,
all is well.

749
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:00,000
Oil is well!

750
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:04,120
Shut up and stop the boat.

751
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:09,000
Help me!
I've got on to the wrong boat.

752
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:13,840
- Bring out the gun.
- Help me.

753
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:15,360
Gun!

754
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:40,240
Enough.

755
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:48,280
Catch them and arrest them.

756
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:51,440
You're the first smuggler who is
so happy about being arrested.

757
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:52,880
No, Sir.

758
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:53,760
I'm not a smuggler.

759
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:54,840
I am not with them, Sir.

760
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:55,920
I am an Indian, Sir.

761
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:58,080
Is it? Show me your passport!

762
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:00,000
Passport? Why, Sir?

763
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:02,520
To verify whether you are
an Indian or Sri Lankan.

764
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:06,520
But Sir, I am not with them.

765
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:08,720
I speak Hindi, Sir!

766
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:10,520
We can also talk in Hindi.

767
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:13,000
Listen. Hindi!

768
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:14,360
What?

769
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:15,720
We all speak in Hindi!

770
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:17,120
Sir, he's my man.

771
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:18,320
And you are my wife!

772
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:19,200
What?

773
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:24,600
What are you looking at?
Arrest him.

774
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:25,840
What does that mean?

775
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:31,440
<i>They say if you suffix word Ji,
to any other word</i>

776
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:32,400
<i>You gain respect.</i>

777
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:34,960
<i>Refu... Ji.</i>

778
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:36,480
<i>I did not gain anything!</i>

779
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:40,760
<i>Here my fate was being written by
my grandpa sitting in heavens</i>

780
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:44,280
<i>Whereas Meena's fate
was being written by her father.</i>

781
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:48,680
<i>He decided to get her
married to Tangaballi.</i>

782
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:51,760
<i>Meena was neither happy
with it nor was it her choice.</i>

783
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:55,560
<i>Who would have thought
That the tip of India</i>

784
00:57:55,800 --> 00:58:00,240
<i>Would begin a new chapter
In Meena's and my life.</i>

785
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:25,000
Brother, what are you looking at
with such fear?

786
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:26,440
- Is this yours?
- Yes.

787
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:28,320
I'm sure there is RDX in it.

788
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:30,360
Not "there is."
There was.

789
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:31,560
I mean, there was!

790
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:32,760
My grandpa is in it.

791
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:34,160
I mean my grandpa's ashes.

792
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:35,040
Allow me to show you.

793
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:40,560
I have been telling you that
I am not a smuggler!

794
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:52,320
You know, Sir. I came from Mumbai
to immerse my grandpa's ashes. That's all.

795
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:55,040
<i>I told the police everything truthfully.</i>

796
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:57,520
<i>My history.
The geography of my travel.</i>

797
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:59,560
<i>And my chemistry
with the people of Komban.</i>

798
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:02,560
<i>After hearing all this, all
the Marine police officer said was...</i>

799
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:05,120
So, the people of Komban know you, right?

800
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:48,360
Sir!

801
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:49,440
You!

802
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,560
Your fellow brothers are dropping
me to Mumbai.

803
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:53,600
Give me a hug!

804
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:56,440
You left me there, right?

805
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:58,920
Because of some smugglers
I went away to Sri Lanka.

806
00:59:59,000 --> 00:59:59,880
You didn't go away. You came back...

807
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:00,920
- to Komban.
- No, I can't come.

808
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,480
How can that happen?

809
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:03,880
Look...

810
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:14,040
I'll be back.

811
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:15,920
Brother, me too.

812
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:17,000
Catch him.

813
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:18,280
What are you doing, man?

814
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:23,000
Sir, please leave me for heaven's sake!

815
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:25,160
Hello, Sir.

816
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:26,680
Hello.

817
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:28,920
Do you know him?

818
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:31,200
Do we know him?

819
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:34,560
We know him.

820
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:37,000
- Periya.
- Yes.

821
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:38,120
He is our family member, isn't it?

822
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:41,440
Yes, he is one of us.

823
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:43,560
Hey, where had you disappeared?

824
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:46,920
There's such tension
since you went missing.

825
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:49,760
Oh, family!
So you are an Indian after all.

826
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:51,800
I will release you here and leave.

827
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:53,840
Officer, you cannot leave me here and go.

828
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:57,480
I am Sri... Devi

829
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:03,080
"How are you, my darling?"

830
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:04,640
Refree, right?

831
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:06,600
No, Sir. I meant, Periyathalai Sir...

832
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:08,680
Hanger, right?

833
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:10,000
I meant strong, Sir.

834
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:11,360
You called me fat?

835
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:13,280
Chewing gum, right?

836
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:20,400
Do not step ahead.
I am warning you.

837
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:22,680
I will cut down all!

838
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:24,080
Hold this.

839
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:26,800
Nobody steps ahead.

840
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:30,040
If anybody comes forward, I will...

841
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:32,360
cut myself.

842
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:33,560
Okay, cut yourself.

843
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:35,920
Cut yourself.

844
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:38,280
I will cut Meenamma.

845
01:01:58,760 --> 01:01:59,560
Stop.

846
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:03,440
I will cut Meenamma.

847
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:08,800
Meenamma, open the door.

848
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:11,800
Nobody moves!

849
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:17,640
Move!

850
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:21,280
What do I do, Meenamma?

851
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:28,840
Catch him.

852
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:22,080
Come on, get out.

853
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:25,880
First you get drunk and run away
all by yourself.

854
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,520
Then you get into trouble
and use me to run away.

855
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:29,400
And now you're asking me
to get out of the car!

856
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:31,000
Yes, that's what I said.
Get out, please.

857
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:31,880
I won't get out.

858
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:33,000
This car belongs to my father.

859
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:34,680
If you don't get out,
I will take you back there.

860
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:35,920
Then you'll get married.

861
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,400
Before that, from Rahul you
will become Late Rahul.

862
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:41,320
I mean I think there's no parking here.
Let's go.

863
01:03:56,520 --> 01:03:57,560
Rahul!

864
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:48,680
What happened? Has the
car broken down?

865
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:51,360
No! Who told you that?

866
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:53,880
What is with the smoke, then?

867
01:05:53,960 --> 01:05:54,800
Smoke?

868
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:56,440
The car is smoking a cigarette.

869
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:57,760
And do you know why I came outside?

870
01:05:57,840 --> 01:06:00,880
I thought to myself, that I could wait and
relax here and Tangaballi would come by.

871
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:03,760
And, when he comes, the three
of us can play together.

872
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:05,520
Can't you see?

873
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:08,360
Your father's car is even worse
than your Hindi.

874
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:09,520
You have wrecked the car!

875
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:11,600
Don't call this a car,
it'd be a sin to call this a car.

876
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:13,200
This car has saved your life.

877
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:15,280
It's not a car, it's a wreck!

878
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:18,440
My father's favorite car!

879
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:27,400
Catch it, Rahul!

880
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:29,960
I didn't mean it. Wait!

881
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:44,000
- No!
- Oh, no!

882
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:57,480
Take it!

883
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:00,280
Take it, Meenamma baby.

884
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:02,120
Your father's favorite car.

885
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:04,520
Actually the problem is not your father,
or his wrecked car.

886
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:05,520
The problem is you.

887
01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:08,640
Wherever you go, you carry
a free trouble pack along with you.

888
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:10,320
Actually you are like a black cat.

889
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:12,760
Worse than a black cat!

890
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:15,600
If you cross the path of a black cat,
it will get cursed.

891
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:17,400
Then why are you with me?

892
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:18,520
Why am I with you?

893
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:19,960
Why are you with me?

894
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:22,000
Please, Meenamma.
Stop stalking me.

895
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:25,840
Alright.

896
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:29,720
But by the way, you stole the car and
drove in the wrong direction.

897
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:31,720
Now we have only one way out.

898
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:34,080
We'll have to cross Komban again!

899
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:35,520
Don't scare me with Komban.

900
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:38,400
If you are not with me,
I will manage on my own easily.

901
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,960
There's no word called impossible
in my dictionary.

902
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:45,000
Really? From where did you buy such
a rubbish dictionary?

903
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:52,520
Get lost.

904
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:05,160
<i>I thought I would not meet
Meenamma ever again.</i>

905
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:08,440
<i>But fate had decreed
something else altogether.</i>

906
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:26,160
Brother.

907
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:10,240
Hello, Sir.

908
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:13,439
I need to find the road.

909
01:09:14,279 --> 01:09:17,760
Where is the highway?

910
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:26,200
What are you doing?

911
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:30,200
I want to see the road.

912
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:34,840
Where is the highway?

913
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:37,200
Where is the highway?

914
01:09:56,680 --> 01:09:58,480
Relax, my child!

915
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:01,800
Don't take so much trouble.
I feel bad, then.

916
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:05,960
The two of us have the same problem.

917
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:08,080
At this age, we don't need
a new language.

918
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:38,920
Hey, brother!

919
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:43,520
Please, stop.

920
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:48,000
Hello, brother!

921
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:49,760
What do you want?
What is your work here?

922
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:53,920
I'm a boy, Rahul.
I need a lift!

923
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:56,480
You're from Mumbai, right?

924
01:10:57,240 --> 01:10:58,560
How do you know so much about me?

925
01:10:58,680 --> 01:11:00,680
The entire South knows you.

926
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:05,360
One fair boy has eloped with Durgeshwara
Azagsundaram's daughter in a car.

927
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:07,760
Oh my God!

928
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:10,000
Today you are in a car tomorrow
you will be the headline of a newspaper.

929
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:11,440
- No, listen to me.
- Go away.

930
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:15,080
You don't know, the village people
are chasing you with sticks!

931
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:19,560
Once you're caught they will kill you
and put that as a headline!

932
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:22,240
Let it be. Is it their kingdom?

933
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:25,920
The girl you have eloped with,
this is her father's kingdom!

934
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,160
Brother, please help me.

935
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:30,360
- Go away.
- Brother, please.

936
01:11:30,680 --> 01:11:31,960
Brother, help me.

937
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:35,760
Brother!

938
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:42,640
<i>I became numb after hearing this.</i>

939
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:45,800
<i>I could see the road ahead</i>

940
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:48,560
<i>But there was no way out.</i>

941
01:11:49,720 --> 01:11:51,400
<i>Except one.</i>

942
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:54,480
Meenamma...

943
01:11:57,320 --> 01:11:59,280
Meenamma...

944
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:01,440
Meenamma...

945
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:03,040
Meenamma...

946
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:07,600
What is it?

947
01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:08,840
What?

948
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:11,160
You've come back to me after all!

949
01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:15,240
You figured out how does it feel
to live alone, didn't you?

950
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:16,760
Look at your face.

951
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:19,480
It seems like you are getting
a fever because you are so frightened.

952
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:22,160
Come on.
I've come to take you.

953
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:24,880
We will go together. Come!

954
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:28,960
Again you've taken the wrong route.

955
01:12:29,160 --> 01:12:31,480
This is the safer route.
That side you will find Tangaballi.

956
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:32,480
Come on!

957
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:35,880
Meenamma, I'll save you.

958
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:22,040
Vidamba village.

959
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:24,000
Come on.

960
01:13:37,640 --> 01:13:39,800
A wedding ceremony is going on here.

961
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:41,760
If we make up a story

962
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:44,080
we can stay here for a few days.

963
01:13:44,440 --> 01:13:47,520
Until then father and Tangaballi's tension
will get a bit diffused.

964
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:50,040
Then why are you standing here
and talking, Ms. Subtitle?

965
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:51,520
Go ahead and talk to them.

966
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:54,360
Such attitude!

967
01:13:54,440 --> 01:13:55,640
Why don't you go and talk?

968
01:13:55,720 --> 01:13:56,800
I can.

969
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:58,400
I know <i>kunjam kunjam</i>.

970
01:13:58,520 --> 01:14:00,480
<i>"Apadiya sapadiya Po."</i>

971
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:03,400
Your grandpa can go take a hike!

972
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:05,520
You know how to speak Marathi?

973
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:08,400
If you can speak Tamil, why can't
I speak Marathi?

974
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:11,840
Oh, mother! Meenamma,
for now just go and talk in Tamil.

975
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:23,680
<i>It seemed very pleasant but
there was something fishy.</i>

976
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:27,640
<i>There was something definitely fishy.</i>

977
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:40,280
<i>Once bitten, twice shy.</i>

978
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:43,960
<i>That's why, this time
I did not nod in agreement.</i>

979
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:58,880
<i>The second time when the villagers
looked at me, I...</i>

980
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:02,760
What happened?

981
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:06,680
Hey! Don't come to me.

982
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:31,040
Open the window.
Let the fresh air come in.

983
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:34,760
Here is the towel and some clothes.

984
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:36,800
Rest well.

985
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:40,720
In the morning, after your bath,
we will arrange the prayers.

986
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:44,920
Rest well. Take care of him. Bye.

987
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:48,280
You know, a film should be made on me.

988
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:49,960
I laugh my way into a mess.

989
01:15:50,160 --> 01:15:53,200
Whenever people gladly lift me up on
their shoulders, I know I am in a trouble.

990
01:15:53,320 --> 01:15:54,320
And you, Meenamma...

991
01:15:56,840 --> 01:15:58,360
What are the lies you have
spun around this time?

992
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:01,640
I told them we got married and ran away.

993
01:16:01,880 --> 01:16:05,880
Have you copyrighted this story
of getting married and running away?

994
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:10,680
Then what did you say?

995
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:17,680
The second lie was that you're so good
that you will never leave me and go.

996
01:16:18,680 --> 01:16:22,960
Then you agreed to me.

997
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:24,080
Yes.

998
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:29,120
Then I said you got so tired
with the journey

999
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:32,200
that you felt like fainting.

1000
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:33,920
That's why...

1001
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:35,080
You nodded.

1002
01:16:35,160 --> 01:16:36,440
Yeah, like this.

1003
01:16:36,920 --> 01:16:38,480
Nodded!

1004
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:40,800
That's why I'm getting
this special treatment.

1005
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:41,920
No.

1006
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,280
The special treatment is because
I told them...

1007
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:46,720
the reason why we eloped is because
my father has a huge problem

1008
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:49,440
with you being poor and me being rich.

1009
01:16:50,680 --> 01:16:52,200
I am very rich.

1010
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:55,440
And you are a confectioner.

1011
01:16:58,720 --> 01:17:01,200
How did you know
I was a confectioner?

1012
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:06,080
You are a confectioner?

1013
01:17:09,680 --> 01:17:10,560
No.

1014
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:15,920
Yes.

1015
01:17:16,840 --> 01:17:18,040
I am a confectioner.

1016
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:22,360
What is so funny about that?

1017
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:24,400
A confectioner is better than
being a don.

1018
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:26,240
Quiet.

1019
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:34,960
That means my third lie
is actually the truth.

1020
01:17:36,520 --> 01:17:37,600
You are making fun of me now?

1021
01:17:37,680 --> 01:17:39,560
Earlier, your father made
a fool out of me.

1022
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:41,440
What a great father-daughter duo!

1023
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:44,280
I wonder how your mother tolerates
the two of you.

1024
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:46,200
Does she ever protest or
does she also...

1025
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:51,600
I don't have a mother.

1026
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:16,720
I had no idea.

1027
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:29,240
I know what it feels like
to not have a mother.

1028
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:32,640
Why?

1029
01:18:34,040 --> 01:18:35,120
Your parents?

1030
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:39,240
They died in a car accident.

1031
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:41,600
I was eight years old then.

1032
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:47,280
Since then you've been all alone?

1033
01:18:55,680 --> 01:18:58,400
Actually I never really missed
my parents...

1034
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:02,440
because my grandparents took their place.
Especially grandpa.

1035
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:05,880
He was always happy when I was happy.

1036
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:08,520
He couldn't live without me.

1037
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:10,480
Rahul this, Rahul that... Rahul...

1038
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:16,400
My grandpa.

1039
01:19:21,160 --> 01:19:22,320
Still Rahul...

1040
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:27,280
To go through fifty years
of your life without parents...

1041
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:32,480
Yes, Meenamma.
It is hard, but...

1042
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:35,800
Fifty years?

1043
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:37,400
Yes.

1044
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:40,680
Do I look like I'm fifty years old?

1045
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:43,560
Why? You're not?

1046
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:47,040
Don't tell me you're more than that?

1047
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:22,120
Meenamma, will you sleep on the floor?

1048
01:20:22,720 --> 01:20:24,920
This is not for me. It's for you.

1049
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:29,000
Won't you be able to control yourself if
I sleep with you on the bed?

1050
01:20:29,160 --> 01:20:31,440
Shut up, okay!
I have a problem.

1051
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:35,360
Yes, exactly.
You won't be able to control yourself.

1052
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:36,760
Stop your nonsense.

1053
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:37,760
What does that mean?

1054
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:39,400
- Stop your nonsense.
- Do?

1055
01:20:39,480 --> 01:20:43,160
Naughty! Aunty!
Remember? Do...

1056
01:20:44,160 --> 01:20:47,440
I will sleep on the bed because
I am your spouse.

1057
01:20:47,640 --> 01:20:50,720
And as they say there is no business
like show-her business.

1058
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:53,640
Come on, Meenamma.
Let us sleep, momma!

1059
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:56,440
Fine, sleep if you want.

1060
01:20:56,520 --> 01:20:58,720
Don't tell me later that
I didn't warn you.

1061
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:01,320
I can give no guarantee for
what will happen at night.

1062
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:04,320
Rahul, consider that you
will be taken advantage of

1063
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:06,240
tonight because your wife has no control.

1064
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:23,680
<i>Tangaballi... Don't come closer.</i>

1065
01:21:24,240 --> 01:21:27,320
<i>I will kick you.</i>

1066
01:21:28,360 --> 01:21:31,680
<i>Tangaballi... Don't come closer.</i>

1067
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:34,800
<i>I will kick you.</i>

1068
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:39,760
Tangaballi... Don't come closer.

1069
01:21:40,720 --> 01:21:43,560
I will kick you.

1070
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:47,160
Tangaballi... Don't come closer.

1071
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,760
I will kick you.

1072
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:54,840
I will not leave you.

1073
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:56,720
I'm sorry but I don't know your language.

1074
01:21:56,800 --> 01:22:02,600
Do not come closer.

1075
01:22:02,680 --> 01:22:06,400
Do not come closer.
I will kick you.

1076
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:08,720
Do not come closer.

1077
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:10,280
Help me.

1078
01:22:10,360 --> 01:22:12,360
Meena has gone crazy.

1079
01:22:12,680 --> 01:22:14,200
Meena has turned into a witch!

1080
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:22,000
Didn't I ask you to not sleep next to me?

1081
01:22:23,640 --> 01:22:25,720
I kick in my sleep.

1082
01:22:26,360 --> 01:22:28,280
Am I your father's scooter
that you will kick?

1083
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,360
You're not the daughter of a don. You're
the daughter of a donkey!

1084
01:22:34,240 --> 01:22:36,600
I will never sleep with you.

1085
01:22:37,480 --> 01:22:39,080
You're a witch!

1086
01:22:39,680 --> 01:22:40,480
Get lost.

1087
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:41,360
You get lost.

1088
01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:47,000
Now you do.

1089
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:49,760
Are you dressed up
for your morning jog?

1090
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:51,520
No.

1091
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:53,760
It's the village ritual for newlyweds.

1092
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:54,680
Ritual?

1093
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:59,360
The husband carries his wife in his arms
and climbs up the steps to the temple.

1094
01:23:59,560 --> 01:24:01,800
They believe it strengthens
the marital bond.

1095
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:05,640
Are you strong?

1096
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:08,600
What is the need to be strong
to watch a ritual?

1097
01:24:08,760 --> 01:24:10,880
You don't have to watch,
you have to do it.

1098
01:24:11,960 --> 01:24:14,200
We are husband and wife for them.

1099
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:16,800
No, I will not be forced
into doing anything.

1100
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:18,680
No, the situation is like that.

1101
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:19,600
What?

1102
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:21,560
Helplessness!

1103
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:22,680
What helplessness?

1104
01:24:23,320 --> 01:24:24,880
Do you want to stay here or not?

1105
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:26,080
Yes, I want to stay.

1106
01:24:26,280 --> 01:24:28,800
Then you will have to carry me.
You won't drop me, right?

1107
01:24:30,200 --> 01:24:32,640
Meenamma, perhaps you are forgetting.

1108
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:35,720
Confectioner?

1109
01:24:52,520 --> 01:24:54,480
We will reach the temple
after climbing three hundred steps.

1110
01:24:54,640 --> 01:24:55,720
Three hundred!

1111
01:24:55,800 --> 01:24:57,480
I will reach heaven
after climbing a hundred.

1112
01:24:57,560 --> 01:24:58,600
What happened?

1113
01:24:58,680 --> 01:25:00,120
Where has the power
of the common man gone?

1114
01:25:01,640 --> 01:25:03,080
I know you will drop me after fifty.

1115
01:27:23,960 --> 01:27:27,560
Rahul, you carried your wife
to the temple.

1116
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:31,960
Meena, he will take care
of you all your life.

1117
01:27:34,280 --> 01:27:35,280
What is he saying?

1118
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:39,880
He's saying that you've proved you'll
look after me for the rest of our lives.

1119
01:27:41,680 --> 01:27:44,040
Raaja, may you live for a
hundred years.

1120
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:48,120
You both will live together
for seven generations.

1121
01:27:49,560 --> 01:27:51,560
Ms Subtitle. What?

1122
01:27:52,480 --> 01:27:55,600
They believe that the couples who are able
to complete this ritual...

1123
01:27:55,720 --> 01:27:57,800
God will keep them together
for the next seven lives.

1124
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:03,080
Why haven't you put vermillion?

1125
01:28:03,720 --> 01:28:05,000
What is he saying?

1126
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:09,840
Without the vermillion the ritual
is not complete.

1127
01:28:10,520 --> 01:28:11,440
What?

1128
01:28:11,880 --> 01:28:12,800
You should have mentioned it earlier.

1129
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:14,080
Does that mean all of this is wasted?

1130
01:28:14,240 --> 01:28:15,760
My body is hurting so much!

1131
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:17,440
Put this vermillion, my son.

1132
01:28:24,040 --> 01:28:24,840
No, Rahul.

1133
01:28:41,960 --> 01:28:42,760
What happened?

1134
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:45,920
This ritual won't be complete
without the vermillion.

1135
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:47,120
These people will take us out from here.

1136
01:28:47,200 --> 01:28:49,080
Come on and hurry up.

1137
01:28:49,160 --> 01:28:51,320
We have to descend 300 steps and
this time you will help me.

1138
01:29:07,400 --> 01:29:09,840
<i>Like Lord Krishna, the one with
Dark cloud like complexion</i>

1139
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:13,000
<i>With a butter eaten mouth
You stole my heart</i>

1140
01:29:13,080 --> 01:29:15,600
<i>Like Lord Krishna, the one with
Dark cloud like complexion</i>

1141
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:18,720
<i>With a butter eaten mouth
You stole my heart</i>

1142
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:24,360
<i>With nectar like sweetness
You ruled over all Gods</i>

1143
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:29,560
<i>On seeing this sweetness
My eyes won't look at anything else</i>

1144
01:29:35,720 --> 01:29:40,640
<i>My heart, like a butterfly</i>

1145
01:29:40,720 --> 01:29:46,400
<i>Has taken flight far away</i>

1146
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:57,840
<i>My heart, like a butterfly</i>

1147
01:29:57,920 --> 01:30:01,320
<i>Has taken flight far away</i>

1148
01:30:01,400 --> 01:30:08,880
<i>With sweet fragrances it has gone to stay</i>

1149
01:30:09,040 --> 01:30:14,520
<i>I have never felt this way
A ray of light</i>

1150
01:30:14,720 --> 01:30:21,200
<i>Kisses the darkness away</i>

1151
01:30:21,320 --> 01:30:26,240
<i>My heart, like a butterfly</i>

1152
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:30,080
<i>Has taken flight far away</i>

1153
01:30:30,240 --> 01:30:35,680
<i>Should I say it in words
Or inscribe it on the sky</i>

1154
01:30:36,040 --> 01:30:42,560
<i>Praise be to you</i>

1155
01:30:42,680 --> 01:30:47,440
<i>My heart, like a butterfly</i>

1156
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:51,000
<i>Has taken flight far away</i>

1157
01:30:51,200 --> 01:30:56,000
<i>With sweet fragrances</i>

1158
01:30:56,080 --> 01:30:59,720
<i>It has gone to stay</i>

1159
01:31:36,720 --> 01:31:40,880
<i>Your deep blue eyes</i>

1160
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:45,040
<i>Tease me with a glance</i>

1161
01:31:45,120 --> 01:31:49,400
<i>Your soothing words can</i>

1162
01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:53,520
<i>Also put the birds in a trance</i>

1163
01:31:53,720 --> 01:31:56,000
<i>A little incomplete without you</i>

1164
01:31:56,440 --> 01:31:59,360
<i>Now I feel complete</i>

1165
01:31:59,480 --> 01:32:05,120
<i>Your simplicity has swept me off my feet</i>

1166
01:32:05,200 --> 01:32:10,040
<i>My heart, like a butterfly</i>

1167
01:32:10,120 --> 01:32:13,960
<i>Has taken flight far away</i>

1168
01:32:14,200 --> 01:32:19,280
<i>Should I say it in words
Or inscribe it on the sky</i>

1169
01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:26,320
<i>Praise be to you</i>

1170
01:32:26,480 --> 01:32:29,280
<i>Like Lord Krishna, the one with
Dark cloud like complexion</i>

1171
01:32:29,360 --> 01:32:32,120
<i>With a butter eaten mouth
You stole my heart</i>

1172
01:32:32,200 --> 01:32:34,920
<i>Like Lord Krishna, the one with
Dark cloud like complexion</i>

1173
01:32:35,040 --> 01:32:37,840
<i>With a butter eaten mouth
You stole my heart</i>

1174
01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:43,520
<i>With nectar like sweetness
You ruled over all Gods</i>

1175
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:48,840
<i>On seeing this sweetness
My eyes won't look at anything else</i>

1176
01:33:03,560 --> 01:33:04,560
What happened, Rahul?

1177
01:33:05,480 --> 01:33:06,880
What? I am packing.

1178
01:33:07,120 --> 01:33:08,120
Why?

1179
01:33:10,360 --> 01:33:12,440
Do you want to forever
live here in this Vidamba village?

1180
01:33:12,600 --> 01:33:13,880
Look, Meenamma. This is enough.

1181
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:15,840
We will quietly slip away
without telling anyone.

1182
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:17,840
Otherwise, these people
will keep making us do weird rituals.

1183
01:33:17,920 --> 01:33:18,720
You also get ready.
Let's go

1184
01:33:18,800 --> 01:33:19,920
No, Rahul.

1185
01:33:20,080 --> 01:33:22,640
If we run away from here then
what will the villagers think?

1186
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:24,480
They will think that we've run away.

1187
01:33:25,920 --> 01:33:26,920
Get ready.

1188
01:33:28,520 --> 01:33:30,320
It's about the villager's feelings, Rahul.

1189
01:33:32,440 --> 01:33:35,240
What about when they find out that
we lied about being married?

1190
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:37,280
Will they help anyone the next time?

1191
01:33:37,480 --> 01:33:38,920
Will these people be able
to trust anyone again?

1192
01:33:39,360 --> 01:33:41,440
- As it is...
- Meena..

1193
01:33:43,320 --> 01:33:46,360
Is it that you don't want
to leave this place?

1194
01:33:48,240 --> 01:33:50,920
I've noticed that ever since you've
started playing the role of being my wife

1195
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:52,320
you have been having a lot of fun.

1196
01:33:52,840 --> 01:33:56,920
Look, don't get serious about the fact
that I've put vermillion on your head.

1197
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:57,840
That was a stupid ritual.

1198
01:33:57,920 --> 01:33:58,800
Rahul!

1199
01:34:00,280 --> 01:34:02,480
Only you can think this way!

1200
01:34:03,600 --> 01:34:05,960
Did you ever think how would
the villagers feel?

1201
01:34:06,360 --> 01:34:09,960
Forget the village, have you ever thought
about your grandma's feelings?

1202
01:34:12,200 --> 01:34:15,960
You only said that your
grandpa had replaced your father, right?

1203
01:34:17,480 --> 01:34:18,560
And what did you do?

1204
01:34:18,640 --> 01:34:21,440
You changed the place where
he wanted his ashes immersed.

1205
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:24,160
Yes! I changed the place.

1206
01:34:24,280 --> 01:34:25,240
Do you know why?

1207
01:34:25,320 --> 01:34:27,360
Because I don't have any feelings.

1208
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:29,560
I am bad. Actually I am a very bad man!

1209
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:31,080
Only you are very good.
These villagers are very good.

1210
01:34:31,240 --> 01:34:32,680
Grandma, grandpa is.

1211
01:34:32,760 --> 01:34:34,800
And a bad person has no right
to stay amongst good people.

1212
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:37,600
So I'll just go. You know what?
You keep this with you.

1213
01:34:37,680 --> 01:34:39,320
You are good. He was good.

1214
01:34:39,400 --> 01:34:41,440
All of you make a company
of good people and live together.

1215
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:43,440
I am not going to live
in this village alright.

1216
01:34:46,440 --> 01:34:47,600
Spare me, please!

1217
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:07,960
<i>Even though I was mad,
I had a sinking feeling</i>

1218
01:35:08,040 --> 01:35:11,880
<i>about leaving Meenamma all alone.</i>

1219
01:35:40,200 --> 01:35:41,240
You've come?

1220
01:35:46,440 --> 01:35:47,800
Rahul! This...

1221
01:36:33,800 --> 01:36:35,920
This is too much!

1222
01:36:43,880 --> 01:36:46,760
Tangaballi, hold on a minute.

1223
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,600
No personal enmity here, Sir.

1224
01:36:57,040 --> 01:36:59,480
Why do you want to take me
to Komban village and kill?

1225
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:00,680
No point, Sir.

1226
01:37:01,640 --> 01:37:03,760
You've got your lady, Sir.

1227
01:37:05,120 --> 01:37:07,320
Leave me.

1228
01:37:25,480 --> 01:37:26,440
What?

1229
01:37:26,520 --> 01:37:27,520
From my heart, Sir.

1230
01:37:27,960 --> 01:37:29,160
I am speaking from my heart, Sir.

1231
01:37:32,520 --> 01:37:33,520
Throw away, Sir.

1232
01:37:33,840 --> 01:37:35,520
Do whatever you want
with your lady, Sir.

1233
01:37:35,640 --> 01:37:37,560
Get married!

1234
01:37:41,480 --> 01:37:43,040
Sir, she's your girl.

1235
01:37:43,120 --> 01:37:45,520
You can sing any song you want
to with her.

1236
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:47,240
Now Meena is all yours, my friend.

1237
01:37:48,680 --> 01:37:49,520
Hey, you!

1238
01:37:49,640 --> 01:37:52,160
You're stupid, parasite
and an opportunist!

1239
01:37:52,240 --> 01:37:53,400
You are leaving me and running?

1240
01:37:53,480 --> 01:37:54,960
- Try and understand.
- Understand what?

1241
01:37:55,040 --> 01:37:56,000
- That...
- What that?

1242
01:37:56,080 --> 01:37:57,800
- That only...
- What that only?

1243
01:38:03,160 --> 01:38:04,920
<i>I've played such a game</i>

1244
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:09,520
<i>That I fool the opponent
And the game comes in my hands</i>

1245
01:38:11,520 --> 01:38:13,800
<i>To save you idiot</i>

1246
01:38:15,560 --> 01:38:17,600
<i>I've played a ruse</i>

1247
01:38:32,720 --> 01:38:35,480
<i>So, this was your strategy?</i>

1248
01:38:36,040 --> 01:38:42,440
<i>Since when did you become
brave enough to defend me?</i>

1249
01:38:42,520 --> 01:38:43,400
<i>Meena!</i>

1250
01:38:43,960 --> 01:38:45,080
<i>Washing powder, Meena!</i>

1251
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,800
<i>No matter how wicked I am,
I am human after all</i>

1252
01:38:48,880 --> 01:38:51,680
<i>I thought to myself that
I must help you, Meena</i>

1253
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:54,760
<i>Now do you understand what I'm saying</i>

1254
01:38:54,840 --> 01:38:55,760
<i>Meena!</i>

1255
01:38:57,920 --> 01:39:00,720
<i>Pick up the sickle that's</i>

1256
01:39:02,760 --> 01:39:05,640
<i>Beside Tangaballi</i>

1257
01:39:06,520 --> 01:39:11,800
<i>Take it</i>

1258
01:39:12,200 --> 01:39:15,240
<i>Yes! I will take it</i>

1259
01:39:24,960 --> 01:39:27,560
<i>I've understood my lady love</i>

1260
01:39:28,760 --> 01:39:31,480
<i>You two think I don't understand</i>

1261
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,520
<i>And that you can make
a fool out of me</i>

1262
01:39:36,680 --> 01:39:37,720
Tangaballi is singing in Hindi?

1263
01:39:37,800 --> 01:39:38,600
Yes!

1264
01:39:38,960 --> 01:39:42,160
<i>Balli Balli I am Tangaballi</i>

1265
01:39:42,240 --> 01:39:45,720
<i>I know your plan</i>

1266
01:39:45,880 --> 01:39:46,680
Means?

1267
01:39:46,760 --> 01:39:49,040
<i>Now you're in trouble</i>

1268
01:39:49,120 --> 01:39:51,240
<i>You will not sing to him anymore</i>

1269
01:39:51,320 --> 01:39:54,920
<i>Now you will bid farewell to this world,
while doing disco</i>

1270
01:39:55,440 --> 01:39:56,240
Okay, that's enough!

1271
01:39:56,320 --> 01:39:57,720
Hey, Tangu!

1272
01:40:08,720 --> 01:40:09,880
Hey, Tangu!

1273
01:40:10,080 --> 01:40:13,080
If you touch him, I will cut you.

1274
01:40:29,720 --> 01:40:32,120
You do not know...

1275
01:40:33,160 --> 01:40:34,480
who you are fighting with.

1276
01:40:34,560 --> 01:40:39,600
We're nice to good people
and a nightmare for bad ones.

1277
01:40:39,680 --> 01:40:41,240
Understood?

1278
01:40:41,760 --> 01:40:46,280
We live in South but we are in the center
of people's hearts.

1279
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:50,120
Whoever ridicules our honor and culture,
we teach them such a lesson that...

1280
01:40:50,240 --> 01:40:52,000
they wet their pants.

1281
01:40:52,120 --> 01:40:53,120
Rahul!

1282
01:41:36,880 --> 01:41:38,080
Meena...

1283
01:41:38,240 --> 01:41:39,760
Nobody can understand women.

1284
01:41:39,840 --> 01:41:41,320
Even at a time like this she's
worried about her things!

1285
01:41:59,200 --> 01:42:01,800
<i>Really, no one can
understand women.</i>

1286
01:42:20,840 --> 01:42:21,840
Let's go.

1287
01:42:49,360 --> 01:42:51,280
Here, take your ticket to Mumbai.

1288
01:42:52,880 --> 01:42:53,680
And you?

1289
01:42:54,440 --> 01:42:59,640
I am going to immerse grandpa's ashes
in the waters of Rameshwaram.

1290
01:43:02,680 --> 01:43:05,760
You know Meenamma, I just realized...

1291
01:43:13,680 --> 01:43:17,640
No matter how wicked I am,
I am a human after all, Meena.

1292
01:43:23,560 --> 01:43:24,640
You thought it right.

1293
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:27,880
You just said one thing wrong.

1294
01:43:29,720 --> 01:43:31,680
I will also come
with you to Rameshwaram.

1295
01:43:31,760 --> 01:43:33,400
What? Have you gone mad?

1296
01:43:33,480 --> 01:43:34,480
This is wrong.

1297
01:43:34,960 --> 01:43:36,480
- I'm doing the right thing.
- How is it right?

1298
01:43:36,920 --> 01:43:38,480
With such difficulty,
you've got the chance to run away.

1299
01:43:38,560 --> 01:43:41,560
I could have run away when you were drunk
in the village.

1300
01:43:41,920 --> 01:43:43,880
I didn't run away then.
So, why will I now?

1301
01:43:45,400 --> 01:43:46,840
I will also come with you.

1302
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:48,360
Meenamma, try to understand.

1303
01:43:48,440 --> 01:43:50,920
I've taken a decision. Let me complete it
on my own accord, please.

1304
01:43:51,080 --> 01:43:53,000
And, you might be in danger there.

1305
01:43:53,080 --> 01:43:54,640
- What if Tangaballi reaches there?
- Exactly.

1306
01:43:54,760 --> 01:43:56,920
I will save you from Tangaballi.

1307
01:43:57,800 --> 01:43:59,480
That's why I should come with you!

1308
01:44:49,560 --> 01:44:53,640
<i>Sometimes two roads travel side by side</i>

1309
01:44:53,720 --> 01:44:58,080
<i>They slowly converge
At the end of the ride</i>

1310
01:44:58,280 --> 01:45:02,200
<i>Sometimes when trouble
Become twice their size</i>

1311
01:45:02,600 --> 01:45:06,200
<i>They are halved when shared
With someone nice</i>

1312
01:45:06,640 --> 01:45:11,040
<i>Our love story is so strange</i>

1313
01:45:11,160 --> 01:45:15,040
<i>Sometimes we progress, sometimes we curb</i>

1314
01:45:15,200 --> 01:45:19,600
<i>Though I am the North pole
And you are the South</i>

1315
01:45:19,760 --> 01:45:23,720
<i>Yet our love has brought us together</i>

1316
01:45:23,840 --> 01:45:28,120
<i>Though I am the North pole
And you are the South</i>

1317
01:45:28,360 --> 01:45:33,640
<i>We are equal partners in every situation</i>

1318
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:17,800
<i>Though we fight</i>

1319
01:46:17,920 --> 01:46:19,920
<i>Our partnership is alright</i>

1320
01:46:20,120 --> 01:46:24,320
<i>With you everything seems alright</i>

1321
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:28,840
<i>We are two different people
With different attitudes</i>

1322
01:46:29,080 --> 01:46:32,600
<i>We wander the world in style</i>

1323
01:46:32,680 --> 01:46:37,000
<i>Sometimes we go apart and come back</i>

1324
01:46:37,080 --> 01:46:41,360
<i>We live our lives in the moment
Our moods change like the seasons</i>

1325
01:46:41,440 --> 01:46:45,280
<i>Though I am the North pole
And you are the South</i>

1326
01:46:45,800 --> 01:46:49,880
<i>The naughty north has given south a wink</i>

1327
01:46:49,960 --> 01:46:54,440
<i>Though I am the North pole
And you are the South</i>

1328
01:46:54,520 --> 01:46:58,760
<i>We will be together
Forget about the whole world</i>

1329
01:46:58,840 --> 01:47:02,880
<i>Sometimes two roads travel side by side</i>

1330
01:47:03,120 --> 01:47:07,320
<i>They slowly converge

01:47:07,440 --> 01:47:11,360

<i>We are equal partners in every situation</i>

1339
01:48:09,720 --> 01:48:12,200
Tomorrow morning we
can complete the immersion ritual.

1340
01:48:12,360 --> 01:48:14,760
For tonight we will have
to stay in some lodge.

1341
01:49:21,560 --> 01:49:23,360
You know, Meena...

1342
01:49:23,520 --> 01:49:25,720
We are all so busy running around
in this fast paced life.

1343
01:49:27,200 --> 01:49:30,400
Our lives are no less than a marathon.

1344
01:49:30,560 --> 01:49:33,440
We're all running to gain
something in life.

1345
01:49:34,680 --> 01:49:40,520
Then someday we leave everything
and go away.

1346
01:49:46,400 --> 01:49:48,560
Just like I will leave you
and go tomorrow.

1347
01:49:51,520 --> 01:49:54,000
All your worries will come to an end.

1348
01:50:06,080 --> 01:50:08,440
But where will you go?

1349
01:50:11,440 --> 01:50:12,520
Pune.

1350
01:50:15,520 --> 01:50:17,520
My childhood friend lives there.

1351
01:50:17,600 --> 01:50:18,440
Chitra.

1352
01:50:26,720 --> 01:50:29,400
Meenamma, I was wondering if you
will be safe there or not.

1353
01:50:30,120 --> 01:50:32,760
I mean what if you father's goons
or your cousins reach there?

1354
01:50:38,560 --> 01:50:39,680
Meenamma, you come with me to Mumbai.

1355
01:50:39,760 --> 01:50:41,240
I have a house there.
My grandma will be there.

1356
01:50:41,600 --> 01:50:43,560
You can stay there peacefully.

1357
01:50:43,640 --> 01:50:46,640
Thereafter, you can decide for yourself.

1358
01:50:47,720 --> 01:50:50,080
You can start afresh.

1359
01:50:53,560 --> 01:50:55,120
And what if my father's goons
reach there?

1360
01:50:55,960 --> 01:50:57,200
That's not his kingdom.

1361
01:50:57,280 --> 01:50:59,080
That is not Komban village.
It's Mumbai.

1362
01:50:59,480 --> 01:51:00,800
Nobody can do such a thing there.

1363
01:51:00,880 --> 01:51:04,360
And if my father asks you,
what I am doing in your house...

1364
01:51:06,720 --> 01:51:08,280
What will you say then?

1365
01:51:10,400 --> 01:51:13,160
Then I will tell him that both of us...
You know?

1366
01:51:13,920 --> 01:51:15,080
You and me.

1367
01:51:23,520 --> 01:51:25,240
Pune is fine for me.

1368
01:51:29,480 --> 01:51:31,160
Anyway, I have troubled you a lot.

1369
01:51:31,480 --> 01:51:37,240
<i>It's not your sympathy
But your love that I seek</i>

1370
01:51:42,440 --> 01:51:47,720
<i>I ask for your love
As I know you love me too</i>

1371
01:51:47,920 --> 01:51:49,920
<i>Because of the fear of the world</i>

1372
01:51:50,520 --> 01:51:57,200
<i>I promise I will never
Forfeit you, my dear</i>

1373
01:51:58,840 --> 01:52:02,760
<i>I will never let you go</i>

1374
01:52:04,280 --> 01:52:08,000
<i>I will never let you go</i>

1375
01:52:09,680 --> 01:52:14,120
<i>I will never let you go</i>

1376
01:52:15,080 --> 01:52:19,040
<i>I will never let you go</i>

1377
01:52:19,400 --> 01:52:22,200
<i>If this isn't love</i>

1378
01:52:23,040 --> 01:52:27,440
<i>Then what is love?</i>

1379
01:52:27,600 --> 01:52:30,960
<i>Now that I have won your love</i>

1380
01:52:31,200 --> 01:52:35,520
<i>I don't care if I lose the world</i>

1381
01:52:35,800 --> 01:52:40,880
<i>I will never let you go</i>

1382
01:52:41,760 --> 01:52:46,960
<i>My life has lost its meaning</i>

1383
01:52:49,960 --> 01:52:54,840
<i>Since you are not there with me</i>

1384
01:52:57,800 --> 01:53:00,440
<i>Love is renowned</i>

1385
01:53:00,560 --> 01:53:03,080
<i>Since on this path I have walked down</i>

1386
01:53:03,240 --> 01:53:07,800
<i>I will not leave it mid way</i>

1387
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:14,040
<i>From the path of your love
I will not stray</i>

1388
01:53:14,720 --> 01:53:18,240
<i>I will never let you go</i>

1389
01:53:20,120 --> 01:53:23,720
<i>I will never let you go</i>

1390
01:53:23,800 --> 01:53:25,760
<i>I will never let you go</i>

1391
01:53:25,840 --> 01:53:29,800
<i>I will never let you go</i>

1392
01:53:46,200 --> 01:53:48,440
<i>I will never let you go</i>

1393
01:53:48,960 --> 01:53:53,840
<i>I will never let you go</i>

1394
01:54:42,200 --> 01:54:43,800
Where have we come, Rahul?
You know...

1395
01:54:43,880 --> 01:54:45,360
We've come to the right place, Meenamma.

1396
01:54:45,760 --> 01:54:47,000
They will kill you.

1397
01:54:47,200 --> 01:54:48,520
- Without thinking...
- No, Meenamma.

1398
01:54:49,880 --> 01:54:52,000
I have come to this decision after
a lot of consideration.

1399
01:54:52,120 --> 01:54:54,040
But Rahul...

1400
01:54:55,200 --> 01:54:56,200
Rahul, you have gone mad.

1401
01:54:56,280 --> 01:54:57,200
We had run away from here.

1402
01:54:57,280 --> 01:54:58,480
But for how long will you run?

1403
01:54:58,800 --> 01:55:00,080
But for how long will we run?

1404
01:55:00,480 --> 01:55:02,360
Don't you have any dreams or
a life of your own?

1405
01:55:17,200 --> 01:55:18,120
Hello, Sir.

1406
01:55:18,640 --> 01:55:21,720
You must be wondering that
how I am back here by myself.

1407
01:55:21,880 --> 01:55:23,160
Father, he mean to say...

1408
01:55:23,240 --> 01:55:24,280
No, Meenamma.

1409
01:55:25,080 --> 01:55:27,920
Today your father and me don't need
any translation.

1410
01:55:32,560 --> 01:55:37,600
Because today I will talk by my heart
and you will have to listen.

1411
01:55:39,600 --> 01:55:41,400
Mr. Durgeshwara...

1412
01:55:43,160 --> 01:55:44,160
Sir!

1413
01:55:45,120 --> 01:55:47,240
The most important man
of Komban village.

1414
01:55:47,400 --> 01:55:48,400
Don!

1415
01:55:56,640 --> 01:55:58,040
You must be thinking why
I've come here.

1416
01:55:58,120 --> 01:56:00,120
Who is he?

1417
01:56:01,800 --> 01:56:02,920
Am I mad?

1418
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:04,320
Or am I drunk?

1419
01:56:06,440 --> 01:56:07,720
Not drunk.

1420
01:56:10,480 --> 01:56:13,320
I just came to find out why you are being
so harsh towards Meena.

1421
01:56:13,440 --> 01:56:14,920
Why?

1422
01:56:16,160 --> 01:56:19,120
Don't you love your daughter?

1423
01:56:19,560 --> 01:56:20,560
You don't?

1424
01:56:22,080 --> 01:56:24,440
Because in a wedding you
give your daughter's hand in marriage.

1425
01:56:24,760 --> 01:56:27,080
But you tried to sacrifice her life.

1426
01:56:28,280 --> 01:56:29,800
Would a father do such a thing?

1427
01:56:31,400 --> 01:56:32,200
Like...

1428
01:56:33,200 --> 01:56:35,440
Would a father do such a thing?

1429
01:56:37,080 --> 01:56:39,080
Would a father do such a thing?

1430
01:56:46,360 --> 01:56:48,520
I am a confectioner.

1431
01:56:51,440 --> 01:56:53,160
But I will say something bitter.

1432
01:56:53,840 --> 01:56:56,080
You can be the father of this village,
the God father of this village...

1433
01:56:56,280 --> 01:56:58,440
But you cannot be your daughter's father.
Never, sir.

1434
01:57:00,920 --> 01:57:04,840
Your pull and power, full marks for that.
Very good, Sir.

1435
01:57:05,560 --> 01:57:08,240
But in one subject you have failed.
Zero!

1436
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:14,320
Don't you have any value for
your daughter's emotions...

1437
01:57:14,560 --> 01:57:16,800
her wish, her happiness?

1438
01:57:28,240 --> 01:57:32,720
But alike Meena, no girl in this village
have rights to celebrate independence.

1439
01:57:33,240 --> 01:57:34,320
No right!

1440
01:57:34,720 --> 01:57:35,760
Even you people...

1441
01:57:36,160 --> 01:57:39,880
If you don't care for your daughter's
emotions, then this entire village...

1442
01:57:40,640 --> 01:57:42,520
this unity, Periyathalai!

1443
01:57:42,600 --> 01:57:44,520
This power is bullshit, Sir.

1444
01:57:57,280 --> 01:57:58,280
Now what do we do?

1445
01:57:58,360 --> 01:58:00,000
Do we fight? Come on!

1446
01:58:01,680 --> 01:58:03,000
Hit me.

1447
01:58:04,320 --> 01:58:07,200
I will not fight back because
I want to do the right thing.

1448
01:58:08,560 --> 01:58:09,680
It's straight and simple, boss!

1449
01:58:09,800 --> 01:58:11,280
I am a common man. I get angry.

1450
01:58:15,160 --> 01:58:16,480
What is it that you had said?

1451
01:58:17,280 --> 01:58:20,080
"You've come here alive but
that's not how you'll leave.

1452
01:58:20,160 --> 01:58:22,880
I will cut you into pieces and parcel it."

1453
01:58:23,920 --> 01:58:26,000
I'll now fight with you.

1454
01:58:26,760 --> 01:58:28,440
I will fight with each of your men.

1455
01:58:28,720 --> 01:58:30,160
Fight everyone!

1456
01:58:30,360 --> 01:58:32,840
Fight the entire village if I have to.
Only for Meena.

1457
01:59:05,080 --> 01:59:06,200
Rahul!

1458
01:59:29,840 --> 01:59:30,880
Father, please!

1459
01:59:34,840 --> 01:59:36,000
Father, please.

1460
02:00:03,040 --> 02:00:04,120
Father!

1461
02:03:05,440 --> 02:03:06,320
Rahul!

1462
02:03:14,440 --> 02:03:15,320
Rahul!

1463
02:03:25,640 --> 02:03:27,400
Rahul!

1464
02:06:19,880 --> 02:06:21,000
I will fight.

1465
02:06:33,640 --> 02:06:34,640
Enough.

1466
02:06:39,480 --> 02:06:40,480
My body...

1467
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:42,800
My...

1468
02:06:43,920 --> 02:06:49,480
I certainly have a big body
but your courage is bigger!

1469
02:06:51,640 --> 02:06:53,560
Very big.

1470
02:06:55,280 --> 02:06:56,240
Very big.

1471
02:07:19,840 --> 02:07:21,200
You are like us!

1472
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,480
You win!

1473
02:07:33,440 --> 02:07:36,080
Go, Meena is yours.

1474
02:07:37,200 --> 02:07:38,560
Meena is yours.

1475
02:07:53,680 --> 02:07:57,720
Rahul and Meena will get married.

1476
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:28,440
<i>He's saying that you'll look after me
for the rest of our lives.</i>

1477
02:08:30,360 --> 02:08:33,080
<i>Those who complete the ritual</i>

1478
02:08:33,720 --> 02:08:35,680
<i>are kept together by God,
for seven lives.</i>

1479
02:09:12,400 --> 02:09:13,720
You love me so much?

1480
02:09:20,920 --> 02:09:23,640
Then we should have eloped
from Rameshwaram.

1481
02:09:24,440 --> 02:09:26,360
Why did you risk coming to Komban?

1482
02:09:31,160 --> 02:09:32,040
Confectioner?

1483
02:09:35,840 --> 02:09:36,840
Confectioner.

1484
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:45,040
Now will you nod your head for what
I am about to ask you?

1485
02:09:48,800 --> 02:09:53,280
Do you love me as much as I love you?

1486
02:09:59,880 --> 02:10:01,440
Meena Lochini...

1487
02:10:03,840 --> 02:10:05,680
Will you marry me?

1488
02:10:11,840 --> 02:10:16,400
Will you kick me at night, mistaking me
for your father's scooter?

1489
02:10:32,600 --> 02:10:37,440
<i>1635 languages
are spoken in our country.</i>

1490
02:10:37,920 --> 02:10:42,400
<i>But today I realized, that
the most important language is love!</i>

1491
02:10:43,240 --> 02:10:45,480
<i>Indeed, love has no language.</i>

1492
02:10:45,880 --> 02:10:49,000
<i>The credit of making a common man,
the hero of Komban village</i>

1493
02:10:49,160 --> 02:10:50,440
<i>goes to my grandpa.</i>

1494
02:10:50,640 --> 02:10:51,680
<i>My grandpa!</i>

1495
02:10:52,320 --> 02:10:54,280
<i>He gave me a wake up call when</i>

1496
02:10:54,400 --> 02:10:56,760
<i>I was immersing his ashes
in the waters of Rameshwaram.</i>

1497
02:10:59,160 --> 02:11:03,280
<i>One wrong train,
Chennai Express, showed me the right way.</i>

1498
02:11:03,800 --> 02:11:06,840
<i>Today Rahul will surely
tell Meenamma that...</i>

1499
02:11:07,400 --> 02:11:09,680
<i>those who truly love,
get their love.</i>
