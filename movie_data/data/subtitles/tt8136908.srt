1
00:01:25,508 --> 00:01:27,758
What's so funny?

2
00:01:28,008 --> 00:01:30,425
Honestly.
We were all apes in the beginning.

3
00:01:30,508 --> 00:01:33,258
And, we also had a tail.

4
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,425
We'd roam naked in the jungles.

5
00:01:38,467 --> 00:01:39,467
Yes, Pichku.

6
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:42,008
And the grown-ups? They too?

7
00:01:42,092 --> 00:01:44,258
There were not clothes to begin with.

8
00:01:44,342 --> 00:01:45,925
They'd take a dump out in the open?

9
00:01:46,258 --> 00:01:48,175
Of course. We were apes.

10
00:01:48,425 --> 00:01:49,592
And what would we eat?

11
00:01:49,675 --> 00:01:54,883
Fruits, leaves, small insects.
We'd eat them raw.

12
00:01:54,967 --> 00:01:59,050
Then came a big change
and we learned to grow our food.

13
00:01:59,133 --> 00:02:01,758
-What did we learn?
-Farming.

14
00:02:02,258 --> 00:02:05,008
We had to settle down
because of farming.

15
00:02:05,092 --> 00:02:08,175
We built homes
because we had to settle down.

16
00:02:08,383 --> 00:02:11,675
Then we built machines, computers.

17
00:02:11,967 --> 00:02:15,092
Soon the entire world was connected
through the Internet.

18
00:02:15,592 --> 00:02:20,175
Now, we can watch the entire world
on a cell phone which is so small.

19
00:02:20,258 --> 00:02:21,258
Now imagine,

20
00:02:21,383 --> 00:02:23,842
those apes who roamed
the jungles versus

21
00:02:23,925 --> 00:02:27,383
us who has the entire world
on their cell phones.

22
00:02:27,675 --> 00:02:30,050
Ever wondered how we got here?

23
00:02:30,133 --> 00:02:31,633
They must eat dry fruits.

24
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,342
No. Let me tell you. Education.

25
00:02:36,842 --> 00:02:40,758
Education teaches us
to see beyond our problems.

26
00:02:40,967 --> 00:02:44,800
-You guys have any problems?
-No! No!

27
00:02:44,883 --> 00:02:47,092
-Wow! No one has any problems.
-No.

28
00:02:47,175 --> 00:02:48,592
That's a good thing.

29
00:02:48,675 --> 00:02:50,508
Pichku, speak up.

30
00:02:50,925 --> 00:02:53,842
Stand up. Now tell me. Very good.

31
00:02:54,717 --> 00:02:57,508
Let me tell you.

32
00:02:57,633 --> 00:03:02,175
He can't do it in the open.
He craps inside his house.

33
00:03:04,717 --> 00:03:06,967
Be quiet. Be quiet, children.

34
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:10,258
-Tell me. Pichku.
-Sit down!

35
00:03:10,342 --> 00:03:12,050
-Pichku.
-Pichku.

36
00:03:12,467 --> 00:03:16,383
-Where are you going?
-Pichku, wait!

37
00:04:49,008 --> 00:04:51,717
<i>They say villages are normally</i>

38
00:04:51,842 --> 00:04:53,300
<i>nestled near river banks.</i>

39
00:04:53,383 --> 00:04:55,217
<i>Though I've never seen a river,</i>

40
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:57,300
<i>but it must be true.</i>

41
00:04:57,383 --> 00:04:59,508
<i>Take my neighborhood for instance.</i>

42
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:02,092
<i>It's situated right next to a river.</i>

43
00:05:02,758 --> 00:05:04,758
<i>The only difference is</i>
<i>that this river is made of steel.</i>

44
00:05:04,842 --> 00:05:08,842
<i>People go to a river to bathe</i>
<i>in the morning.</i>

45
00:05:10,883 --> 00:05:12,342
<i>But in this river...</i>

46
00:05:13,175 --> 00:05:14,050
<i>they relieve themselves.</i>

47
00:05:14,133 --> 00:05:16,967
<i>In fact,</i>
<i>the people in my village know</i>

48
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,717
<i>each and every train's timetable</i>

49
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,008
<i>better than the rail ministry.</i>

50
00:05:21,175 --> 00:05:22,175
<i>And you know what,</i>

51
00:05:22,383 --> 00:05:24,300
<i>Some leave behind a lingering</i>
<i>fragrance for the Rajdhani</i>

52
00:05:24,717 --> 00:05:25,800
<i>while some leave it for the Duronto.</i>

53
00:05:25,883 --> 00:05:28,092
Get up, guys. Or we'll have to
clean up in Gorakhpur.

54
00:05:28,217 --> 00:05:29,467
-<i>Maybe you don't know...</i>
-The train's coming.

55
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:31,842
<i>...but the fragrance from</i>
<i>every home in this village</i>

56
00:05:31,925 --> 00:05:33,758
<i>travels all over India.</i>

57
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:36,008
Stand up, every one.

58
00:05:36,092 --> 00:05:39,008
<i>Not my fragrance though.</i>

59
00:05:45,508 --> 00:05:50,217
<i>I do it from my home.</i>
<i>Comfortably. At ease.</i>

60
00:06:09,258 --> 00:06:13,133
Ramesh, I'm taking my mother
to the hospital. Will you come along?

61
00:06:13,217 --> 00:06:15,050
Spare me, I don't have the time.

62
00:06:16,925 --> 00:06:18,508
I'll pay you.

63
00:06:18,758 --> 00:06:20,883
Then I'll take you wherever you want.

64
00:07:19,675 --> 00:07:23,217
Mom, get my lunch box ready.
It's getting late.

65
00:07:25,883 --> 00:07:27,383
Pichku.

66
00:07:27,967 --> 00:07:29,550
-Yeah.
-What's the incense stick for?

67
00:07:30,925 --> 00:07:34,717
It's Tuesday.
So mom asked me to burn them.

68
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:37,342
Tuesday.

69
00:07:38,717 --> 00:07:40,800
Are you telling the truth or did
you do something at home again?

70
00:07:40,883 --> 00:07:42,342
No, dad, I swear.

71
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:48,758
You're a grown-up boy now, okay?

72
00:07:50,633 --> 00:07:51,883
Get my food.

73
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:13,925
Didn't you wash your hands?

74
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:16,758
Are you trying to teach me?

75
00:08:17,342 --> 00:08:18,425
I am your father.

76
00:08:19,217 --> 00:08:20,675
<i>That's my father.</i>

77
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:22,800
<i>Had I not been born,</i>

78
00:08:23,383 --> 00:08:25,300
<i>you could've never become a father.</i>

79
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,092
<i>Ramesh.</i>

80
00:08:32,425 --> 00:08:35,383
<i>He thinks he's smart</i>
<i>just because he's a grown-up.</i>

81
00:08:35,925 --> 00:08:37,050
<i>In fact, it's not just him.</i>

82
00:08:37,467 --> 00:08:40,092
<i>That's what all the grown-ups think.</i>

83
00:08:53,467 --> 00:08:54,675
<i>I still remember the day</i>

84
00:08:54,758 --> 00:08:59,925
<i>when my mom made me wear pants,</i>
<i>and said: "You're a big boy now.</i>

85
00:09:00,008 --> 00:09:02,092
<i>You shouldn't roam around naked."</i>

86
00:09:02,175 --> 00:09:04,383
<i>Since then no one in this slum</i>

87
00:09:04,467 --> 00:09:06,092
<i>has seen me naked.</i>

88
00:09:06,175 --> 00:09:07,425
<i>But boy, look at this guy.</i>

89
00:09:17,717 --> 00:09:21,008
<i>So Bapu, why don't you tell me</i>
<i>who is wrong here?</i>

90
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:25,550
<i>The grown-ups who sit naked</i>
<i>on the railway tracks.</i>

91
00:09:26,133 --> 00:09:27,342
<i>Or me?</i>

92
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:36,258
-Bittu, my bro. Do it properly.
-What happened?

93
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:38,842
You come down and do it then.

94
00:09:38,925 --> 00:09:41,925
-Anna, get to work.
-What do you think you're doing?

95
00:09:42,008 --> 00:09:44,550
Aslam never listens to me.

96
00:09:44,633 --> 00:09:46,592
Will you get back to
work or just fool around?

97
00:09:46,675 --> 00:09:47,842
Bittu, work faster.

98
00:10:10,175 --> 00:10:11,967
Late again, aren't you.

99
00:10:12,217 --> 00:10:16,342
Ignore him, Rani.
It's become a habit for him.

100
00:10:16,425 --> 00:10:17,800
You're no different.

101
00:10:18,383 --> 00:10:19,717
Damn you.

102
00:10:23,883 --> 00:10:29,717
<i>-Pair of bulls and village belles</i>
<i>-Bunnu.</i>

103
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,717
<i>Makes my heart go restless</i>

104
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,675
Move aside.

105
00:10:36,008 --> 00:10:36,967
Pichku, move aside.

106
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:40,633
<i>-Bunnu, what's wrong with you?</i>
<i>-Hold on, Mom.</i>

107
00:10:41,675 --> 00:10:43,675
Did you ask him to pray today?

108
00:10:44,258 --> 00:10:45,258
Why?

109
00:10:45,717 --> 00:10:47,175
Mom, give me some more gravy.

110
00:10:47,258 --> 00:10:48,342
In a minute.

111
00:10:48,425 --> 00:10:49,633
Did you tell him?

112
00:10:49,717 --> 00:10:54,842
Remember you said it's Tuesday,
and I must pray...

113
00:10:54,925 --> 00:10:55,967
Yes.

114
00:10:57,592 --> 00:11:01,633
-Of course. Did you do it, son?
-Yes, mom.

115
00:11:03,217 --> 00:11:05,217
He lit a dozen incense sticks.

116
00:11:07,092 --> 00:11:08,508
Because it's for free.

117
00:11:10,175 --> 00:11:11,633
He's no longer a kid.

118
00:11:13,175 --> 00:11:15,050
Stop covering up for him.

119
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:18,342
-Your pampering will spoil him...
-Fine.

120
00:11:18,425 --> 00:11:21,758
From now on, you can pamper him
and I'll scold him.

121
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:24,592
He should get scolded.

122
00:11:24,842 --> 00:11:27,758
Else someday,
he'll get out of hand.

123
00:11:33,925 --> 00:11:36,383
My dear son,
the day I catch you red-handed,

124
00:11:37,008 --> 00:11:39,842
I'll parade you naked in the streets.

125
00:11:40,342 --> 00:11:42,425
Just remember, I am your father.

126
00:11:42,508 --> 00:11:44,592
<i>Why do you look so startled?</i>

127
00:11:45,133 --> 00:11:46,800
<i>No reason.</i>

128
00:11:46,883 --> 00:11:48,342
<i>-Daddy.</i>
<i>-No.</i>

129
00:12:00,717 --> 00:12:02,175
You made jasmine incense today.

130
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:03,633
Hmm.

131
00:12:06,842 --> 00:12:11,008
Mom, please tell dad
to build a toilet at home.

132
00:12:14,883 --> 00:12:19,092
Like I said before, if you
don't want to do it in the open,

133
00:12:19,175 --> 00:12:21,342
then use the public toilet.

134
00:12:22,258 --> 00:12:26,008
But it's worse than the railway tracks.

135
00:12:28,467 --> 00:12:31,050
It takes only a minute.

136
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,217
Cover your nose like this.

137
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,842
I feel like puking.

138
00:12:36,633 --> 00:12:39,342
-What?
-That place makes me puke.

139
00:12:40,883 --> 00:12:42,758
Then come with me in the morning.

140
00:12:42,967 --> 00:12:44,258
At 4 a.m.?

141
00:12:45,842 --> 00:12:46,967
Get some sleep.

142
00:12:47,258 --> 00:12:51,217
Mom, please ask dad
to build a toilet at home.

143
00:12:52,258 --> 00:12:53,383
What?

144
00:12:55,092 --> 00:12:56,342
And where will we live?

145
00:12:56,883 --> 00:12:59,758
I meant behind our house.

146
00:12:59,925 --> 00:13:01,508
I've already picked a spot.

147
00:13:03,217 --> 00:13:04,675
Go to sleep.

148
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:32,300
Look, they are playing with their sacks.

149
00:13:32,508 --> 00:13:36,550
<i>Eenie meenie miney mo!</i>

150
00:13:36,633 --> 00:13:40,633
<i>Catch a bad chick by her toe!</i>

151
00:14:03,758 --> 00:14:07,050
-You lose every day.
-She won today.

152
00:14:12,008 --> 00:14:15,925
Boss, my wages.
I'm in a hurry.

153
00:14:16,008 --> 00:14:18,008
-I'll come back later.
-You're always in a hurry.

154
00:14:18,092 --> 00:14:19,717
You hardly work. Huh?

155
00:14:20,008 --> 00:14:21,342
How much is it?

156
00:14:21,717 --> 00:14:22,967
Thirty rupees.

157
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,425
Thirty rupees.

158
00:14:25,508 --> 00:14:27,883
I'm paying 20 now. Take it.

159
00:14:29,342 --> 00:14:30,633
Or leave it.

160
00:14:30,717 --> 00:14:31,800
Here you go.

161
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,883
Wait, my son.

162
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:44,925
Money. Fork it over.

163
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:46,425
I don't have any.

164
00:14:46,508 --> 00:14:48,383
Want a slap? Hand it over.

165
00:14:57,383 --> 00:14:58,300
Here. Now go.

166
00:15:08,842 --> 00:15:10,300
Wait, Pichku.

167
00:15:10,383 --> 00:15:12,633
-Does your father drink?
-No.

168
00:15:12,717 --> 00:15:14,592
-Does he gamble?
-No.

169
00:15:14,675 --> 00:15:16,383
Then why does he take your money?

170
00:15:16,467 --> 00:15:18,508
He saves his money and spends mine.

171
00:15:18,675 --> 00:15:19,633
Why?

172
00:15:20,008 --> 00:15:21,800
He's saving up to
buy his own auto-rickshaw.

173
00:15:21,883 --> 00:15:23,258
Are you going to take a dump?

174
00:16:21,383 --> 00:16:22,342
Pichku!

175
00:16:26,675 --> 00:16:28,050
Pichku, open the door.

176
00:16:28,842 --> 00:16:30,258
Pichku, open the door.

177
00:16:30,342 --> 00:16:32,467
Else first, I'll break open the door
and then break your bones.

178
00:16:34,592 --> 00:16:35,633
Pichku!

179
00:16:39,008 --> 00:16:41,675
It's not even Tuesday.

180
00:16:41,758 --> 00:16:43,342
Why did you burn incense sticks today?

181
00:16:44,383 --> 00:16:45,883
Stop this charade!

182
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,258
Why are you holding your pants?

183
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:50,925
The buttons are broken.

184
00:16:51,008 --> 00:16:52,175
Really?

185
00:16:52,467 --> 00:16:54,175
I'll teach you a lesson today.

186
00:16:54,258 --> 00:16:55,425
-Come on...
-Papa.

187
00:16:55,508 --> 00:16:56,967
Let me carry some water.

188
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:58,800
Forget the water.
I'll take you to the river today.

189
00:16:58,883 --> 00:17:00,508
-Move.
-Let me carry some papers.

190
00:17:03,592 --> 00:17:07,258
-<i>Caught with your pants down</i>
-Pichkoo got caught!

191
00:17:07,342 --> 00:17:09,300
-Let go!
-Come on.

192
00:17:09,467 --> 00:17:10,717
Come on.

193
00:17:10,883 --> 00:17:15,967
<i>Don't miss this auspicious moment!</i>

194
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:17,633
Pichku, my son, bless you.

195
00:17:17,717 --> 00:17:22,883
-<i>Caught with your pants down in public</i>
-Come on.

196
00:17:25,925 --> 00:17:31,800
<i>Your reputation has gone for a toss</i>

197
00:17:40,217 --> 00:17:44,050
<i>Looks like the only solution</i>
<i>Is to set your bowels in motion</i>

198
00:17:44,175 --> 00:17:47,508
<i>Just go and crap</i>

199
00:17:47,883 --> 00:17:51,758
<i>Go on tiptoes lightly</i>
<i>Let it swell, let it spill</i>

200
00:17:51,842 --> 00:17:55,508
<i>Quick! Just go and crap</i>

201
00:17:55,592 --> 00:18:00,842
<i>Free advice doesn't come easy</i>
<i>So learn this lesson</i>

202
00:18:06,925 --> 00:18:11,008
<i>In this bunch of naked buffoons</i>

203
00:18:14,883 --> 00:18:18,550
<i>Keep your briefs on and celebrate!</i>

204
00:18:18,633 --> 00:18:22,467
<i>Just go and lose it</i>
<i>Just go and crap!</i>

205
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:25,925
<i>Son, it's okay, just do it</i>

206
00:18:33,717 --> 00:18:38,217
<i>Oh child, just go and crap!</i>

207
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:53,758
<i>Yours is an open secret</i>

208
00:18:53,842 --> 00:18:57,883
<i>What if word reaches the town square?</i>

209
00:18:57,967 --> 00:19:03,342
<i>They may come in a procession</i>

210
00:19:03,508 --> 00:19:07,550
<i>Riding like grooms on horseback</i>
<i>To teach you a lesson!</i>

211
00:19:07,633 --> 00:19:11,133
<i>You'll realise too late</i>
<i>You're at the wrong wedding</i>

212
00:19:11,217 --> 00:19:14,925
<i>You're at the wrong wedding</i>
<i>So celebrate!</i>

213
00:19:15,008 --> 00:19:17,175
<i>In this bunch of naked buffoons</i>

214
00:19:17,258 --> 00:19:20,717
<i>Keep your briefs on, celebrate!</i>

215
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:24,883
<i>Just go and lose it</i>
<i>Just go and crap!</i>

216
00:19:24,967 --> 00:19:28,300
<i>Son, it's okay, just do it</i>
<i>Just go and crap!</i>

217
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:40,842
<i>Dear, just go and crap!</i>

218
00:19:43,758 --> 00:19:47,675
<i>You're in for a coronation</i>
<i>In the wide open, celebrate!</i>

219
00:19:47,758 --> 00:19:51,425
<i>Oh sensible one in this bunch</i>
<i>Of naked buffoons, celebrate!</i>

220
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:55,342
<i>Congratulations for inviting</i>
<i>This trouble for yourself</i>

221
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:59,092
<i>Oh sensible one in this bunch</i>
<i>Of naked buffoons, celebrate!</i>

222
00:19:59,217 --> 00:20:01,175
<i>Keep your briefs on, celebrate!</i>

223
00:20:01,258 --> 00:20:02,800
-<i>Keep your briefs on, celebrate!</i>
-Sit down.

224
00:20:02,883 --> 00:20:04,883
-Why are you covering your nose?
-Do it.

225
00:20:04,967 --> 00:20:07,175
Do we cover our nose
when we come here in the morning?

226
00:20:07,258 --> 00:20:08,467
-Take your hand off.
-He is right.

227
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:10,342
Pull your pants down and sit.

228
00:20:10,425 --> 00:20:13,258
-Didn't you hear me?
-Make him a throne.

229
00:20:13,383 --> 00:20:15,883
Your throne's ready!
Now sit down.

230
00:20:15,967 --> 00:20:18,300
Please leave, I'll do it.

231
00:20:20,383 --> 00:20:21,842
We'll wait right here.

232
00:20:21,925 --> 00:20:23,800
-Is anyone busy?
-No.

233
00:20:23,925 --> 00:20:24,967
Did you Dear that?

234
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:26,467
Like I said, I am your father

235
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:28,467
and I'll straighten you out.
Now, sit down.

236
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:30,050
The Gorakhpur will soon say hello to you.

237
00:20:30,133 --> 00:20:31,300
-Sit down.
-In a minute or two.

238
00:20:31,925 --> 00:20:34,300
-Pull your pants down and sit.
-Come on.

239
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,300
Sit down.

240
00:20:36,675 --> 00:20:38,425
-Sit down, Pichku.
-Sit down.

241
00:20:38,508 --> 00:20:39,967
-Sit down.
-Come on.

242
00:20:42,133 --> 00:20:44,133
-Don't be shy.
-Come on.

243
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:46,258
Why are you feeling shy?

244
00:20:46,342 --> 00:20:47,550
Sit down, Pichku.

245
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:02,925
-Pichku, no pressure?
-It's not that hard.

246
00:21:03,008 --> 00:21:09,258
Keep your legs closer
to create pressure and it will come out.

247
00:21:10,175 --> 00:21:12,092
Pichku, look at me.

248
00:21:12,383 --> 00:21:14,883
Hold your legs tight like this
and you can do it.

249
00:21:14,967 --> 00:21:16,967
Come here, son.

250
00:21:17,842 --> 00:21:21,258
Go, pat his back like this
and make it easy for him.

251
00:21:21,425 --> 00:21:23,633
-Here?
-Lower.

252
00:21:23,967 --> 00:21:25,425
-Here?
-Yeah, that's the spot.

253
00:21:25,508 --> 00:21:28,592
-It's okay?
-Not me, him.

254
00:21:28,675 --> 00:21:29,675
Go on.

255
00:21:30,342 --> 00:21:32,633
-Go pat him here.
-I won't.

256
00:21:33,842 --> 00:21:35,217
Come here.

257
00:21:36,633 --> 00:21:40,967
-Does it put pressure if you pat here?
-Yes.

258
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:43,425
And where do we pat to make it stop?

259
00:21:44,383 --> 00:21:46,508
-Spiced peas.
-Ramesh.

260
00:21:46,592 --> 00:21:47,800
The snacks seller is here.

261
00:21:47,883 --> 00:21:51,300
Looks like it will be a while.
Get some snacks for the kids.

262
00:21:51,842 --> 00:21:54,758
-Uncle, please...
-Uncle...

263
00:21:57,258 --> 00:22:00,133
-Hey, do you have any money?
-No, I don't.

264
00:22:00,425 --> 00:22:01,550
Give me some cash if you have it.

265
00:22:01,633 --> 00:22:02,883
This is getting
expensive because of you.

266
00:22:02,967 --> 00:22:06,633
Such an auspicious event,
don't be such a miser.

267
00:22:06,717 --> 00:22:09,258
-Come on, Uncle Ramesh.
-Give us money.

268
00:22:16,092 --> 00:22:17,383
Come on, Ramesh. Don't be shy.

269
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:19,883
Yippie! Let's have <i>bhel</i>!

270
00:22:21,925 --> 00:22:23,467
Don't make it too spicy!

271
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,550
Squeeze some lemon.
Make it spicy.

272
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:39,550
He his running away!

273
00:22:39,633 --> 00:22:42,800
-Pichku is running away!
-Hurry up, Uncle.

274
00:22:44,967 --> 00:22:48,592
Pichku is running away!

275
00:22:48,883 --> 00:22:52,133
-Pichku ran away. Run.
-Catch him.

276
00:22:52,217 --> 00:22:54,800
Catch him! Catch him!

277
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:12,383
Wait, Pichku.
Where are you going?

278
00:23:12,675 --> 00:23:15,633
Wait, Pichku.

279
00:23:54,508 --> 00:23:55,800
Where are you?

280
00:23:55,883 --> 00:23:57,008
Are you crazy?

281
00:23:57,175 --> 00:24:00,217
Everyone knows this place is haunted.

282
00:24:02,217 --> 00:24:06,883
-Not just one, there are four ghosts here.
-Be quiet.

283
00:24:16,758 --> 00:24:19,342
-Run!
-Run!

284
00:24:20,175 --> 00:24:22,425
-Ghost. Ghost.
-Run!

285
00:24:22,508 --> 00:24:23,883
What are you doing here?

286
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,800
But no one comes here.

287
00:24:32,883 --> 00:24:34,133
Why did you come here?

288
00:24:34,217 --> 00:24:35,675
-Leave.
-Well, I...

289
00:24:36,467 --> 00:24:38,217
We were playing hide and seek.

290
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:40,092
Couldn't you hide someplace else?

291
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:42,675
-Go hide somewhere else.
-Why?

292
00:24:42,758 --> 00:24:45,592
Try to understand,
I gotta take a dump.

293
00:24:45,675 --> 00:24:46,592
Then do it.

294
00:24:46,675 --> 00:24:49,633
I can't do it when someone's around.

295
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,717
What?

296
00:24:51,092 --> 00:24:54,383
I don't like doing it in
front of someone, now go away.

297
00:24:54,675 --> 00:24:56,008
What's your name?

298
00:24:56,467 --> 00:24:58,675
Gopi. Now leave.

299
00:24:59,008 --> 00:25:00,967
Well, Gopi, I'm leaving.

300
00:25:02,883 --> 00:25:04,258
One more thing.

301
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,217
Now what?

302
00:25:06,592 --> 00:25:07,508
I am Pichku.

303
00:25:07,592 --> 00:25:09,300
Will you please leave?

304
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:11,467
Take your time.

305
00:25:18,842 --> 00:25:20,967
I am trying to save every penny

306
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:22,425
so I can buy my own rickshaw.

307
00:25:22,508 --> 00:25:24,883
And this kid makes me
spend everything I earn.

308
00:25:25,592 --> 00:25:28,217
Today, I had to give
a treat to everyone.

309
00:25:28,592 --> 00:25:29,508
Everyone was making demands.

310
00:25:29,592 --> 00:25:31,717
With chili, without chili.

311
00:25:33,467 --> 00:25:35,008
And what did I get in return?

312
00:25:35,258 --> 00:25:36,342
Humiliation.

313
00:25:36,925 --> 00:25:38,675
Had he done it in front of everyone,

314
00:25:38,883 --> 00:25:40,592
it would've made me so happy.

315
00:25:41,425 --> 00:25:42,717
I would've been proud.

316
00:25:45,175 --> 00:25:46,425
Here's your tea.

317
00:25:47,258 --> 00:25:50,717
Being so shy won't help him.
How will he move up in life?

318
00:25:51,592 --> 00:25:52,925
Will he rot here for the rest of his life?

319
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,592
Let him come home.

320
00:25:56,008 --> 00:25:58,508
I'll break every bone in his body.

321
00:26:43,633 --> 00:26:46,175
There was no need to make a scene.

322
00:26:46,258 --> 00:26:48,967
Your boy's 10 years old now,
but still shits at home.

323
00:26:49,217 --> 00:26:51,758
The only kid in the entire
neighborhood who shits at home.

324
00:26:52,133 --> 00:26:53,967
Then build a toilet for him.

325
00:26:54,133 --> 00:26:56,133
What's the need to build a toilet?

326
00:26:56,217 --> 00:26:58,425
The government has laid those
long railway tracks.

327
00:27:00,925 --> 00:27:03,092
Here we are! At your destination.

328
00:27:08,008 --> 00:27:09,717
Have you lost your mind?

329
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:13,300
Keep it!
Save it for your auto-rickshaw.

330
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:16,467
Move.

331
00:28:16,175 --> 00:28:19,133
Don't cry, my child.

332
00:28:20,383 --> 00:28:23,300
Mutthu's toilet

333
00:28:40,175 --> 00:28:41,508
Who is it?

334
00:28:41,592 --> 00:28:43,342
Go look.

335
00:30:55,592 --> 00:30:56,758
Gopi.

336
00:31:21,425 --> 00:31:24,467
-What are you doing here?
-I... I...

337
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:27,258
I've killed and buried
four people out here.

338
00:31:30,133 --> 00:31:32,133
If I ever catch you here again,

339
00:31:32,967 --> 00:31:34,425
I will bury you too.

340
00:31:39,383 --> 00:31:44,050
-Who is Gopi?
-I met him here yesterday.

341
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,717
Bring him to my shop tomorrow.

342
00:31:47,842 --> 00:31:49,300
Or else I'll bury him too.

343
00:32:37,925 --> 00:32:39,050
Gopi.

344
00:32:43,342 --> 00:32:44,467
Come on.

345
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:50,050
I've been to the tracks at least
40 times in the last couple of days.

346
00:32:50,383 --> 00:32:51,675
Even the trains don't
come so regularly.

347
00:32:51,758 --> 00:32:52,883
Unani Medicine

348
00:32:53,633 --> 00:32:55,342
The doctor gave me this medicine.

349
00:32:56,092 --> 00:32:57,342
It worked for a day.

350
00:32:57,925 --> 00:33:01,050
But after that,
I've been passing stools regularly.

351
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:05,425
Son, mortals make these pills...

352
00:33:07,508 --> 00:33:10,133
but my potions are made...

353
00:33:11,092 --> 00:33:12,425
by the Creator Himself.

354
00:33:14,008 --> 00:33:15,800
I have a cure for every problem.

355
00:33:16,175 --> 00:33:19,133
-But why has he called us?
-We'll find out.

356
00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:24,592
And repeat after me...
Tell the lord,

357
00:33:24,967 --> 00:33:28,217
-"I'm fine, I'm fine, I..."
-But why are you taking me to him?

358
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,883
Glory to you, Goddess Jogeshwari.

359
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:31,758
Not now, son.

360
00:33:31,842 --> 00:33:33,883
-Come with me.
-Go home and take it.

361
00:33:34,008 --> 00:33:35,717
Keep taking it until you feel good.

362
00:33:42,258 --> 00:33:45,175
-What the hell is he doing?
-Baba, he is Gopi.

363
00:33:49,008 --> 00:33:50,300
Don't let me catch you there again.

364
00:33:50,383 --> 00:33:52,925
He said you have buried four people
out there.

365
00:33:53,008 --> 00:33:54,467
If I ever see you again...

366
00:33:55,008 --> 00:33:57,300
then he'll be the fifth;
and you, the sixth.

367
00:33:57,883 --> 00:34:00,425
-Are you new around here?
-I may be new around here,

368
00:34:00,508 --> 00:34:01,883
but I'm not new to this world.

369
00:34:01,967 --> 00:34:03,383
Shall I tell the police?

370
00:34:03,758 --> 00:34:05,967
Then you'll be rotting in jail
for the rest of your life.

371
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:07,800
-You'll go to the police, huh?
-Shut up, Gopi.

372
00:34:07,925 --> 00:34:11,633
Forget about the police. I'll go
and tell everyone in the neigborhood.

373
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:15,175
You won't be able
to set your shop anywhere.

374
00:34:15,258 --> 00:34:17,883
Let's go, Pichku.
You were scared of him?

375
00:34:17,967 --> 00:34:20,300
Son, listen...

376
00:34:20,383 --> 00:34:23,092
Son, listen. Listen!

377
00:34:25,592 --> 00:34:27,967
-Hello, Uncle.
-Hello.

378
00:34:28,467 --> 00:34:30,800
-Hey!
-See how he's following us.

379
00:34:30,883 --> 00:34:33,633
-He's a fake, and you were scared of him?
-Wait.

380
00:34:33,717 --> 00:34:37,717
-He will come to us for mercy.
-Wait, kid. Wait. Listen...

381
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,133
-Greetings.
-Greetings.

382
00:34:42,133 --> 00:34:43,175
Come here.

383
00:34:43,633 --> 00:34:46,592
Kids, I didn't bury anyone out there.

384
00:34:47,425 --> 00:34:48,883
There are no ghosts either.

385
00:34:49,342 --> 00:34:51,092
I spread that rumor.

386
00:34:51,758 --> 00:34:52,717
Why?

387
00:34:54,508 --> 00:34:58,133
So that I could do my morning rituals...
without any disturbances.

388
00:35:04,217 --> 00:35:05,633
Baba, you too?

389
00:35:05,717 --> 00:35:07,800
Shh! Don't tell anyone.

390
00:35:08,258 --> 00:35:11,008
Or else my years of hard work
will go to waste.

391
00:35:11,425 --> 00:35:13,425
Fine, we won't tell anyone.

392
00:35:13,675 --> 00:35:15,425
But we'll come there too.

393
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:17,383
Is there...

394
00:35:17,675 --> 00:35:19,925
Is there any lack of space here?

395
00:35:20,425 --> 00:35:21,675
Pick anyone.

396
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,425
Even we can't do it
if someone's watching.

397
00:35:25,508 --> 00:35:27,050
He does it in his own home.

398
00:35:28,008 --> 00:35:30,342
Man! Gopi, you're crazy.

399
00:35:30,883 --> 00:35:32,050
Baba...

400
00:35:48,217 --> 00:35:50,092
You know what, Baba?

401
00:35:50,175 --> 00:35:53,133
We'll divide the place into three parts.

402
00:35:56,342 --> 00:35:57,925
<i>One for him.</i>

403
00:35:59,092 --> 00:36:00,342
<i>One for me.</i>

404
00:36:10,592 --> 00:36:12,550
<i>And one for you.</i>

405
00:36:35,633 --> 00:36:38,508
Sir, you should build my toilet here.

406
00:36:38,592 --> 00:36:40,258
Says who, huh?

407
00:36:40,508 --> 00:36:43,092
Sir, I found this place,
so it should be my toilet.

408
00:36:43,175 --> 00:36:44,967
Hello! You didn't discover a new planet.

409
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:47,925
There isn't room here for two toilets,
and you six want one each!

410
00:36:48,008 --> 00:36:49,217
Sir, there's enough room near my house.

411
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:51,675
Hey, we're still talking to him.
Don't interfere.

412
00:36:51,758 --> 00:36:52,967
We're already getting late.

413
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:56,425
Sir, listen. Why don't you build
one toilet on top of the other?

414
00:36:57,008 --> 00:36:59,300
You could make two three floors
of toilets.

415
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:02,758
And how will you climb up?
There's no place to build stairs.

416
00:37:02,842 --> 00:37:05,175
-Will you install an elevator?
-I've been living here for 20 years...

417
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:09,383
We'll build toilets for everyone.

418
00:37:09,467 --> 00:37:11,633
All right? All of you will get a toilet.

419
00:37:11,717 --> 00:37:13,050
-Eight, sir, eight?
-Huh?

420
00:37:13,175 --> 00:37:15,050
-Eight people, sir.
-Fine.

421
00:37:15,133 --> 00:37:17,258
Not eight, nine! Nine!

422
00:37:19,092 --> 00:37:22,050
Sir, come with me. I'll show you
the space. It's nearby.

423
00:37:22,883 --> 00:37:26,967
Sir, listen. Please, listen!

424
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,092
-Pichku.
-What happened?

425
00:37:29,175 --> 00:37:31,092
-You've hit the jackpot.
-How?

426
00:37:31,175 --> 00:37:34,008
Your father is building a toilet.
Come on.

427
00:37:34,092 --> 00:37:35,300
Wow.

428
00:37:35,717 --> 00:37:36,758
I've given you the advance.

429
00:37:36,842 --> 00:37:38,133
-Forget about it.
-Just see the place.

430
00:37:38,217 --> 00:37:39,925
How can I see it
if you don't show it to me?

431
00:37:40,467 --> 00:37:43,217
The toilet should be nice.

432
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:07,217
Sir, this is my son.

433
00:38:07,383 --> 00:38:08,967
He won't do it in the open.

434
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:11,300
So, I let him do it inside.

435
00:38:11,633 --> 00:38:13,758
We have only one room in our house.

436
00:38:13,842 --> 00:38:16,383
-We eat there...
-Okay, okay. How far is it now?

437
00:38:16,467 --> 00:38:19,342
-I'll show you, sir. Come.
-Where... where are you taking me?

438
00:38:20,342 --> 00:38:22,383
Come, sir. This way.

439
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:24,008
Come.

440
00:38:24,758 --> 00:38:25,842
Come, sir.

441
00:38:27,133 --> 00:38:28,717
-Sir...
-Move aside.

442
00:38:39,633 --> 00:38:40,592
Move aside.

443
00:38:40,675 --> 00:38:42,633
Get 6,000 first,
and then you can have 12,000.

444
00:38:44,967 --> 00:38:47,967
Sir, keep six, give me six.
It's the same thing.

445
00:38:50,008 --> 00:38:51,050
Wow.

446
00:38:52,092 --> 00:38:55,217
-Are you teaching Gopi our game as well?
-Just as wear our shorts,

447
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:58,467
-wear this sack too.
-But this is not a short.

448
00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:00,467
This looks more like Anna's <i>lungi</i>.

449
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:02,217
-Anna's <i>lungi?</i>
-Yes.

450
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:03,508
Throw like this.

451
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:07,092
Now jump with the sack. Come on.

452
00:39:07,175 --> 00:39:09,175
Don't fall down. Be careful.

453
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,758
-Aslam...
-Look Rani's here.

454
00:39:11,842 --> 00:39:13,967
-Rani's here.
-Gopi, let me show you...

455
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:16,258
-Guys, want to see something fantastic?
-What?

456
00:39:16,342 --> 00:39:18,175
Come with me.

457
00:39:19,508 --> 00:39:21,258
Those guys are sweeping the place.

458
00:39:30,967 --> 00:39:34,675
What! Why are they sweeping the place?

459
00:39:34,758 --> 00:39:35,800
Exactly.

460
00:39:35,883 --> 00:39:38,383
I know, I know.

461
00:39:38,467 --> 00:39:41,217
They are sweeping the place,
because they are school kids.

462
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:42,300
What do you mean?

463
00:39:42,633 --> 00:39:46,883
I mean, schools teach them
what they don't know.

464
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:51,633
They are rich kids too.
I bet they don't know how to sweep.

465
00:39:56,258 --> 00:39:59,175
Look at that boy.
He's simply skimming the surface.

466
00:40:21,092 --> 00:40:23,008
Look at that. Look!

467
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:29,717
Gosh! They are playing our game.

468
00:40:54,008 --> 00:40:55,675
What are you doing?

469
00:40:57,050 --> 00:40:59,425
-Move aside.
-I won't.

470
00:41:00,008 --> 00:41:01,508
What is this childishness?

471
00:41:01,967 --> 00:41:04,175
-You're smelling really nice today.
-Move.

472
00:41:04,258 --> 00:41:06,758
I want to take a whiff of this fragrance.

473
00:41:07,383 --> 00:41:08,675
What are you doing, Dad?

474
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:10,883
Nothing, son.

475
00:41:12,508 --> 00:41:13,800
What's that in your hand?

476
00:41:14,842 --> 00:41:17,300
It's the form for the toilet application.

477
00:41:17,425 --> 00:41:18,675
You've come at the right time. Come here.

478
00:41:18,758 --> 00:41:20,217
Tell me what I should write?

479
00:41:22,383 --> 00:41:23,258
Here?

480
00:41:24,133 --> 00:41:29,092
Here, your name, here, address,
and here, your phone number.

481
00:41:29,633 --> 00:41:30,592
Here, right?

482
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,800
-Let's celebrate.
-Wow, son.

483
00:41:35,008 --> 00:41:35,967
Mom.

484
00:41:39,008 --> 00:41:40,508
So who's playing Santa here?

485
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,508
Me! Because we're getting a toilet.

486
00:41:46,758 --> 00:41:48,550
Mom, I have a friend, Gopi.

487
00:41:48,633 --> 00:41:50,383
Even he doesn't like to do it in the open.

488
00:41:50,467 --> 00:41:52,342
I'll give him a key to our toilet.

489
00:41:52,758 --> 00:41:54,925
Is that okay, Mom?
Is that okay, Dad?

490
00:41:55,175 --> 00:41:56,258
Okay, okay.

491
00:41:56,342 --> 00:41:59,092
Have some shame. Tell him.

492
00:41:59,508 --> 00:42:02,425
Listen, no one's building any toilet here.

493
00:42:02,925 --> 00:42:04,425
Here, eat it.

494
00:42:04,967 --> 00:42:08,175
Dad, didn't you tell Mom?
Don't you know, Mom?

495
00:42:08,633 --> 00:42:10,967
Look... your "respected" father

496
00:42:11,050 --> 00:42:13,717
is going to save that money
for his auto-rickshaw.

497
00:42:14,050 --> 00:42:15,425
He won't build a toilet.

498
00:42:25,592 --> 00:42:26,592
Pichku.

499
00:42:27,425 --> 00:42:28,675
Pichku.

500
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:31,258
Why did you have to tell him?

501
00:42:31,633 --> 00:42:33,425
If you care for him,
then build him a toilet!

502
00:42:33,508 --> 00:42:36,383
Stop this toilet rant!
Will a toilet solve our problems?

503
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,550
Just keep saving money
for the rest of your life.

504
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:09,967
-What's going on?
-What...?

505
00:43:10,092 --> 00:43:12,175
There are kids here. Be careful!

506
00:43:12,258 --> 00:43:14,675
Come, come. Careful.

507
00:43:15,133 --> 00:43:16,258
What's going on, Pichku?

508
00:43:16,342 --> 00:43:18,133
This was our toilet.
What's happening?

509
00:43:18,217 --> 00:43:19,592
Come on, come on.

510
00:43:19,717 --> 00:43:21,550
Somebody help him too.

511
00:43:21,633 --> 00:43:24,050
Come, come. Careful.

512
00:43:25,008 --> 00:43:26,592
Move aside, everyone.

513
00:43:26,675 --> 00:43:28,425
Come, come. Careful.

514
00:43:29,675 --> 00:43:31,383
Come on, let's run.

515
00:43:40,342 --> 00:43:41,550
Baba!

516
00:43:57,758 --> 00:43:59,550
Don't be so serious, Baba.

517
00:44:00,425 --> 00:44:01,675
We'll find another place.

518
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:04,342
Ten years.

519
00:44:05,467 --> 00:44:07,425
I looked after that place for ten years.

520
00:44:08,592 --> 00:44:10,717
I threatened and scared
so many people away.

521
00:44:11,008 --> 00:44:12,050
Even terrorized them.

522
00:44:14,092 --> 00:44:15,758
Now where will I go?

523
00:44:22,133 --> 00:44:25,008
-Get up! You too.
-Baba.

524
00:44:26,467 --> 00:44:27,425
Get out. I said get out.

525
00:44:27,508 --> 00:44:29,883
-But what did we do?
-What did you do?

526
00:44:31,175 --> 00:44:35,133
You did that what others couldn't
in the last ten years.

527
00:44:35,508 --> 00:44:37,050
-What did we do?
-Get lost.

528
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:40,508
-I don't want to see you again.
-Come, Pichku.

529
00:44:40,883 --> 00:44:42,300
-Come.
-Let's go, Gopi.

530
00:44:42,383 --> 00:44:45,008
Get lost. Don't come here again.

531
00:44:45,925 --> 00:44:47,758
Unani Medicine

532
00:45:27,633 --> 00:45:31,508
Pichku... do you see that?

533
00:45:31,883 --> 00:45:35,300
That building under construction.
Over there.

534
00:45:35,550 --> 00:45:37,592
-And that tower next to it.
-Yeah.

535
00:45:37,925 --> 00:45:39,592
That's where I used to live before.

536
00:45:40,383 --> 00:45:42,133
That's where our slum was.

537
00:45:43,758 --> 00:45:45,425
Don't you miss it?

538
00:45:45,883 --> 00:45:48,717
Why would I miss it?
It wasn't the Taj Mahal.

539
00:45:50,258 --> 00:45:52,383
But there was a toilet in my home.

540
00:45:53,467 --> 00:45:54,675
I miss that.

541
00:45:55,092 --> 00:45:56,092
Really?

542
00:45:56,342 --> 00:45:58,175
Your own personal toilet.

543
00:45:58,258 --> 00:45:59,258
Really?

544
00:46:13,133 --> 00:46:16,508
-Shall we build our own toilet?
-Are you joking?

545
00:46:16,925 --> 00:46:20,217
-No, honestly.
-But it will be expensive.

546
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:29,300
Gopi, we'll save money,
and then build one.

547
00:46:37,550 --> 00:46:38,508
Look...

548
00:46:39,675 --> 00:46:41,300
Sir, here's the file.

549
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:45,425
Okay, let me check it,
and then I'll get back to you.

550
00:46:48,675 --> 00:46:50,508
Solanki, where's the file for that slum?

551
00:46:50,592 --> 00:46:53,175
We want to meet the officer
who gives money to build a toilet.

552
00:46:53,258 --> 00:46:54,592
It was right here.

553
00:46:54,675 --> 00:46:56,092
This toilet is driving me crazy.

554
00:46:56,425 --> 00:47:00,508
Sir, this toilet is the reason
that your car's parked outside.

555
00:47:01,217 --> 00:47:02,258
Get lost.

556
00:47:02,342 --> 00:47:05,092
Oh, yes. We know this guy.

557
00:47:06,758 --> 00:47:09,092
Hello, sir. Don't you remember us?

558
00:47:11,258 --> 00:47:13,800
-Sir.
-Don't you remember us, sir?

559
00:47:14,258 --> 00:47:17,508
Yes. Aren't you America's new president?

560
00:47:17,925 --> 00:47:19,633
Stop joking, sir.

561
00:47:20,008 --> 00:47:23,800
Remember you came to distribute forms
for the toilet application in our slum?

562
00:47:24,175 --> 00:47:26,258
-Take our form.
-Sir, form.

563
00:47:33,217 --> 00:47:34,633
-Did you get the money?
-What?

564
00:47:35,008 --> 00:47:38,008
-Have you got the money?
-Aren't you supposed to give us the money?

565
00:47:39,133 --> 00:47:40,467
Yes, I will...

566
00:47:41,550 --> 00:47:43,383
but you must give something in return too.

567
00:47:44,592 --> 00:47:47,633
Honestly, sir, we'll build a toilet.

568
00:47:47,717 --> 00:47:49,675
-Honestly.
-Honestly, sir.

569
00:47:55,758 --> 00:47:56,592
Honestly, sir.

570
00:47:56,675 --> 00:47:59,133
Sir, we'll build a toilet. I swear!

571
00:48:03,050 --> 00:48:04,675
We've even picked a place.

572
00:48:05,675 --> 00:48:08,175
Wow! Tadpoles trying to swim the ocean!

573
00:48:09,925 --> 00:48:12,467
You want to take me for a ride?

574
00:48:12,550 --> 00:48:13,633
Sir, we're being honest.

575
00:48:13,717 --> 00:48:15,300
-We'll build a toilet.
-Get out.

576
00:48:15,383 --> 00:48:18,008
-We swear!
-Get lost, you pieces of shit.

577
00:48:18,092 --> 00:48:19,883
How dare you call us pieces of shit?

578
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:21,800
How dare you?

579
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:26,175
You're the piece of shit
who's making money from shit.

580
00:48:26,258 --> 00:48:28,008
-You exploit the poor to make money.
-You...

581
00:48:28,092 --> 00:48:29,758
-Run.
-Stop.

582
00:48:30,467 --> 00:48:32,800
-Catch him!
-Run, Pichku! Run!

583
00:48:32,883 --> 00:48:35,217
Stop! You have the nerves to call me
a piece of shit!

584
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:38,675
-Run, Pichku! Run!
-Stop!

585
00:48:38,925 --> 00:48:41,633
Delhi Shelter Board

586
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:52,758
-Pichku!
-Coming, Mom.

587
00:48:54,717 --> 00:48:56,633
Look at this!

588
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:59,467
Stop rubbing salt in the wound.

589
00:48:59,842 --> 00:49:02,842
I got 6000 rupees
without breaking a sweat!

590
00:49:02,925 --> 00:49:06,008
-Isn't that something to be happy about?
-Big deal.

591
00:49:06,550 --> 00:49:08,633
This is what being street smart gets you.

592
00:49:09,717 --> 00:49:11,050
This is theft.

593
00:49:11,342 --> 00:49:13,633
If 6000 seems like theft to you,

594
00:49:14,092 --> 00:49:16,592
what about the scams that amount
to billions?

595
00:49:17,050 --> 00:49:18,800
-Yes, Mom?
-Go inside.

596
00:49:21,967 --> 00:49:23,592
What are you going to do next?

597
00:49:23,675 --> 00:49:26,008
Do you think I can build a mansion
with 6000 rupees?

598
00:49:26,675 --> 00:49:30,008
-At least you can build a toilet.
-And how will that benefit us?

599
00:49:30,842 --> 00:49:33,717
-Do you want to fall sick?
-You're a strange man.

600
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:36,008
On the contrary,
a toilet will keep sickness at bay.

601
00:49:36,383 --> 00:49:38,217
You two don't see the big picture.

602
00:49:38,717 --> 00:49:40,175
Son, come, have some.

603
00:49:41,717 --> 00:49:44,842
We'll build a toilet, all right?
But there are three of us.

604
00:49:44,925 --> 00:49:46,800
Your darling son will spend
the whole day there,

605
00:49:46,883 --> 00:49:48,842
and we have to hold our poop
to wait for our turn.

606
00:49:49,133 --> 00:49:52,800
And the next thing you know, we are
having stomach aches and fallen sick.

607
00:49:53,925 --> 00:49:58,800
But don't we hold it when we walk
all the way to the railway tracks?

608
00:49:58,883 --> 00:50:00,467
-Every day?
-Correct.

609
00:50:00,550 --> 00:50:01,508
Quiet!

610
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:06,592
Stop giggling, Mother India.
Make me some tea.

611
00:50:07,342 --> 00:50:08,175
Yes, my Lord.

612
00:50:08,258 --> 00:50:10,800
-Look, I found a purse.
-We'll sell it to the junk-seller.

613
00:50:12,550 --> 00:50:14,383
Let me see what's inside.

614
00:50:14,467 --> 00:50:16,717
-What's in it?
-There's no money.

615
00:50:17,175 --> 00:50:19,633
-Show me that.
-It's a bad day today.

616
00:50:19,758 --> 00:50:21,633
Not a single bottle in sight,
no wage either.

617
00:50:28,425 --> 00:50:30,342
Look, he's throwing something for us.

618
00:50:30,467 --> 00:50:31,425
What is it?

619
00:50:31,508 --> 00:50:32,883
Hurry up.

620
00:50:32,967 --> 00:50:35,008
What happened? Where are you going?

621
00:50:36,175 --> 00:50:37,675
What is it?

622
00:50:38,883 --> 00:50:41,925
-Where did it go?
-Find it.

623
00:50:42,050 --> 00:50:44,258
-Move, let me see.
-Move. Move.

624
00:50:44,342 --> 00:50:46,008
Find it.

625
00:50:46,092 --> 00:50:47,633
Find it.

626
00:50:48,717 --> 00:50:49,883
I found it.

627
00:50:49,967 --> 00:50:51,717
Wait, that's mine.

628
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:54,092
It's mine. It's mine.

629
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:55,675
Back to his mischief again.

630
00:50:55,758 --> 00:50:58,717
Give it back, my friend gave it to me.

631
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,258
Give it back.

632
00:51:00,342 --> 00:51:02,967
-Aslam, you're too much.
-Show me what is in the box?

633
00:51:03,050 --> 00:51:05,133
-What is this?
-Give me...

634
00:51:05,217 --> 00:51:06,508
What is this?

635
00:51:07,342 --> 00:51:09,675
What is this?

636
00:51:09,758 --> 00:51:10,842
Open this one too.

637
00:51:10,925 --> 00:51:13,342
Give me too!

638
00:51:13,425 --> 00:51:14,842
Open it.

639
00:51:17,133 --> 00:51:18,425
Wait.

640
00:51:18,925 --> 00:51:20,800
I'll keep this box.

641
00:51:21,133 --> 00:51:24,508
-What's in it?
-Anna, take your sack.

642
00:51:24,842 --> 00:51:26,258
What's in it, Pichku?

643
00:51:26,342 --> 00:51:27,675
Show me.

644
00:51:29,967 --> 00:51:32,842
Aslam, that's mine. Give it back.

645
00:51:33,175 --> 00:51:35,925
-Give it back.
-It's mine.

646
00:51:36,425 --> 00:51:39,967
Give it back. Give it back I said.

647
00:52:35,008 --> 00:52:38,342
-Glory to...
-Mahatma Gandhi.

648
00:52:38,425 --> 00:52:41,758
-Glory to...
-Mahatma Gandhi.

649
00:52:42,050 --> 00:52:45,300
It's Gandhiji's happy birthday today.
Let's go.

650
00:52:53,008 --> 00:52:55,675
-Come, children. Stand in a line.
-Take it.

651
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:58,008
-Slowly. Don't push anyone.
-Thank you.

652
00:52:58,092 --> 00:52:59,550
-Come in line.
-Thank you.

653
00:53:00,425 --> 00:53:01,508
Take this.

654
00:53:01,592 --> 00:53:03,592
-Thank you, sir.
-Pichku, I have a small task for you.

655
00:53:03,675 --> 00:53:05,217
-Up for it?
-What's the task?

656
00:53:05,550 --> 00:53:07,508
You've to get tiles.
Will you do it?

657
00:53:07,883 --> 00:53:10,342
-Will you pay us?
-Of course.

658
00:53:10,467 --> 00:53:11,758
Come to my shop in the evening.

659
00:53:11,883 --> 00:53:13,092
-Now hurry up.
-We'll be there.

660
00:53:13,175 --> 00:53:14,050
Keep moving.

661
00:53:45,092 --> 00:53:46,842
Come on, hurry up.

662
00:53:47,258 --> 00:53:48,217
Come.

663
00:53:48,508 --> 00:53:51,050
Hurry up, this way.

664
00:53:51,133 --> 00:53:54,050
This one... and that one too.

665
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:03,842
-Pichku, Pichku... Look there.
-What happened?

666
00:54:05,008 --> 00:54:06,508
Pichku, go.

667
00:54:07,508 --> 00:54:09,925
Where are you going? I was just joking.

668
00:54:52,258 --> 00:54:54,675
Okay, Mr. Kapil.
This is your first day.

669
00:54:54,758 --> 00:54:55,758
Yes, sir.

670
00:54:56,258 --> 00:54:57,967
-All set?
-Yeah.

671
00:54:58,383 --> 00:55:03,383
And remember, any customer that comes here
shouldn't go empty-handed.

672
00:55:03,467 --> 00:55:05,383
He shouldn't go back empty-handed.

673
00:55:05,842 --> 00:55:07,467
-Got my point?
-Yes, sir.

674
00:55:11,425 --> 00:55:13,258
Pichku, look.

675
00:55:13,633 --> 00:55:16,092
-It's an entire bathroom here.
-Oh, yes!

676
00:55:16,175 --> 00:55:18,842
It's a western toilet. Got it?

677
00:55:19,383 --> 00:55:21,133
You don't have to squat on it.

678
00:55:21,925 --> 00:55:24,217
-This is how you sit.
-Like this?

679
00:55:24,342 --> 00:55:25,300
Yes.

680
00:55:25,967 --> 00:55:27,883
Good evening, sirs.

681
00:55:30,925 --> 00:55:34,175
I didn't do anything.
He asked me to come inside.

682
00:55:35,008 --> 00:55:37,383
-Let's go, Pichku.
-Wait, sir. Wait.

683
00:55:37,467 --> 00:55:39,383
-Let's go.
-Go where!

684
00:55:39,717 --> 00:55:42,675
It's my first day.
Let me practice my pitch. Stand aside.

685
00:55:43,592 --> 00:55:45,967
So, sir, which one do you prefer, sir?

686
00:55:46,050 --> 00:55:48,092
This one or that one, sir?

687
00:55:48,758 --> 00:55:52,800
Sir... look... look at the finishing, sir.

688
00:55:52,883 --> 00:55:57,800
It is made of... fantastic material, sir.

689
00:55:57,883 --> 00:56:00,592
And, sir, it is... it is artwork,
you know.

690
00:56:00,717 --> 00:56:01,592
Artwork.

691
00:56:01,675 --> 00:56:05,425
And watch the shape.
And watch the curves, sir.

692
00:56:05,508 --> 00:56:07,883
Sir, this is not... this is not a toilet.

693
00:56:08,217 --> 00:56:12,008
It is... it is door
which opens to heaven, sir.

694
00:56:17,050 --> 00:56:19,717
-What's the price for it?
-It is priceless, sir.

695
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:24,258
But we have to put a tag
on it so that we can...

696
00:56:24,383 --> 00:56:26,300
Hey... speak in Hindi.

697
00:56:26,758 --> 00:56:30,383
-Not every customer knows English.
-You're dangerous.

698
00:56:31,550 --> 00:56:32,717
Yes, sir. Sure, sir.

699
00:56:33,675 --> 00:56:38,717
Sir, this toilet is...
yes, it's... priceless.

700
00:56:38,967 --> 00:56:42,925
Whenever you'll sit on it,
you'll welcome a new day.

701
00:56:43,050 --> 00:56:48,342
You'll flush your past away,
and plan your day ahead.

702
00:56:48,425 --> 00:56:53,133
-It will be fun.
-That's fine, but how much will it cost?

703
00:56:53,217 --> 00:56:54,217
Just a minute.

704
00:56:55,633 --> 00:56:59,508
-It's... 29,000 only.
-What?

705
00:56:59,925 --> 00:57:02,883
-Only 29,000.
-Twenty-nine thousand!

706
00:57:02,967 --> 00:57:04,008
Yes.

707
00:57:04,550 --> 00:57:06,508
Twenty-nine thousand
for this piece of crockery!

708
00:57:06,592 --> 00:57:07,633
Yes.

709
00:57:08,383 --> 00:57:11,217
Pichku, do you know
what we can get for 29,000?

710
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:13,300
We can build a brand new hut.

711
00:57:15,425 --> 00:57:17,717
-Come on.
-What's the last price you can offer?

712
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:21,383
Nothing at all. I was only practicing,
now you two get lost.

713
00:57:21,467 --> 00:57:23,508
Can't we get it for, like,
200 or 300 rupees?

714
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:27,717
Dear, sir, in that range,
you won't even be allowed to sit on it.

715
00:57:27,842 --> 00:57:28,800
Now you can leave.

716
00:57:31,383 --> 00:57:32,842
Have a good day.

717
00:59:06,092 --> 00:59:09,175
Your friend studies here!
Let's go that way.

718
00:59:09,258 --> 00:59:10,342
-Come.
-Let's go.

719
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:14,258
Oh, wow, there are balloons too!

720
00:59:14,342 --> 00:59:17,258
Must be someone's happy birthday. Come.

721
00:59:20,425 --> 00:59:23,467
Who are you? What are you doing?

722
00:59:24,675 --> 00:59:25,508
Balloon.

723
00:59:25,633 --> 00:59:28,258
Even I can see it's a balloon,
but what are you doing here?

724
00:59:30,133 --> 00:59:32,133
-What?
-We wanted to see the kids.

725
00:59:32,217 --> 00:59:33,758
Are you done now? Now run along.

726
00:59:34,008 --> 00:59:35,550
Get lost, come on.

727
00:59:36,133 --> 00:59:37,217
I said go.

728
00:59:37,925 --> 00:59:41,633
He's just a guard, but he's behaving
as if he owns the school.

729
00:59:41,758 --> 00:59:44,300
-Do you want a thrashing? Get lost.
-Run.

730
00:59:49,425 --> 00:59:52,383
Sir, why have you parked
right in front of the school?

731
00:59:53,008 --> 00:59:54,342
What's inside?

732
00:59:54,425 --> 00:59:56,967
It's the props for the drama.

733
00:59:57,050 --> 00:59:59,758
You mean for the play.
Fine, you can drive it in.

734
01:00:00,717 --> 01:00:02,008
Pichku, Come on.

735
01:00:08,050 --> 01:00:09,133
Come.

736
01:00:10,425 --> 01:00:12,383
Go straight and then take a right turn.

737
01:00:22,050 --> 01:00:23,383
Close the gate.

738
01:00:24,675 --> 01:00:27,300
Hello! Wait!

739
01:01:00,342 --> 01:01:04,758
<i>What I had never seen before</i>
<i>Even in a picture</i>

740
01:01:07,675 --> 01:01:11,550
<i>I'm seeing them in glimpses now</i>

741
01:01:15,050 --> 01:01:19,133
<i>This dream is as real as it gets</i>

742
01:01:21,842 --> 01:01:25,883
<i>Let me fill myself with its fragrance</i>

743
01:01:29,008 --> 01:01:32,425
<i>I see windows in the sky</i>

744
01:01:33,008 --> 01:01:35,842
<i>And clouds for stairs</i>

745
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:38,175
<i>And from a high balcony above</i>

746
01:01:38,258 --> 01:01:42,842
<i>Fairies seem to sprinkle</i>

747
01:01:42,925 --> 01:01:48,550
<i>These sweet scents</i>

748
01:01:50,008 --> 01:01:55,550
<i>These sweet scents</i>

749
01:01:57,592 --> 01:02:01,300
<i>They're blissful, they're heady</i>

750
01:02:01,383 --> 01:02:04,050
<i>They're floating miracles</i>

751
01:02:04,133 --> 01:02:07,300
<i>These sweet scents</i>

752
01:02:07,925 --> 01:02:11,050
<i>These sweet scents</i>

753
01:02:33,675 --> 01:02:36,217
Look, Gopi, it's peeing like us.

754
01:02:41,550 --> 01:02:43,342
-You?
-You guys!

755
01:02:43,883 --> 01:02:45,550
What are you doing here?

756
01:02:47,175 --> 01:02:49,175
Why are you dressed like us?

757
01:02:49,508 --> 01:02:51,133
And why do you look so dirty?

758
01:02:51,217 --> 01:02:53,133
-Look at his hair.
-Yes.

759
01:02:53,508 --> 01:02:55,967
-Rohan, come quickly.
-Yes, sir.

760
01:02:56,092 --> 01:02:59,258
-Come on. Come on.
-What if someone sees us?

761
01:02:59,383 --> 01:03:01,717
-No, no, no.
-Come on.

762
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:03,008
No.

763
01:03:04,050 --> 01:03:11,008
<i>Dreams playing hide-and-seek</i>

764
01:03:11,092 --> 01:03:17,550
<i>They were hiding</i>
<i>I found them, now it's my turn!</i>

765
01:03:18,342 --> 01:03:25,008
<i>This colorful castle, rows</i>
<i>And rows of flowers</i>

766
01:03:25,425 --> 01:03:31,508
<i>My wide eyes can just stare</i>
<i>And stare without tiring</i>

767
01:03:31,592 --> 01:03:33,300
<i>They just touched me</i>

768
01:03:33,383 --> 01:03:35,175
<i>And ran ahead, so I</i>

769
01:03:35,258 --> 01:03:38,758
<i>Just impulsively, ran behind them agog</i>

770
01:03:38,842 --> 01:03:40,550
<i>Found the dreams in some boxes</i>

771
01:03:40,633 --> 01:03:42,342
<i>Which I sorted away safely</i>

772
01:03:42,425 --> 01:03:46,092
<i>Only to open them</i>
<i>When I feel alone again!</i>

773
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:49,633
<i>There are windows in the sky</i>

774
01:03:50,258 --> 01:03:53,258
<i>And clouds for stairs</i>

775
01:03:53,383 --> 01:04:00,092
<i>Fairies showing me the way</i>
<i>Calling out with</i>

776
01:04:00,175 --> 01:04:05,508
<i>Sweet scents</i>
<i>Oh, these sweet scents!</i>

777
01:04:38,842 --> 01:04:40,675
-There they are, ma'am.
-Okay, Ramesh.

778
01:04:40,758 --> 01:04:42,008
Run, Gopi!

779
01:04:42,092 --> 01:04:43,467
-Stop you two.
-Rohan.

780
01:04:43,550 --> 01:04:45,217
Rohan, stop there!

781
01:04:46,383 --> 01:04:48,758
Come... Come upstairs.

782
01:05:20,217 --> 01:05:22,508
Parents and dear children.

783
01:05:23,758 --> 01:05:25,092
Please be seated.

784
01:05:27,758 --> 01:05:30,342
Rohan, would you like to say something?

785
01:05:30,633 --> 01:05:31,633
Yes, ma'am.

786
01:05:34,467 --> 01:05:36,383
I am going to give you a surprise here.

787
01:05:40,133 --> 01:05:43,425
These are my friends,
Pichku and Gopi.

788
01:05:43,717 --> 01:05:48,592
We met today for the first time,
but I've been observing them

789
01:05:48,675 --> 01:05:51,175
and their friends for the last few days.

790
01:05:51,842 --> 01:05:55,258
They pick garbage
from the garbage dump.

791
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:57,800
They even play in that dump,

792
01:05:58,050 --> 01:06:02,092
without worrying about the stares
of passersby.

793
01:06:02,175 --> 01:06:04,175
They live in the moment.

794
01:06:05,217 --> 01:06:07,467
They've taught me how to be happy.

795
01:06:08,925 --> 01:06:12,550
We litter our streets
and they keep it clean,

796
01:06:13,008 --> 01:06:16,633
yet we never say them, "Thank you."

797
01:06:19,675 --> 01:06:23,008
Pichku, Gopi,
I want to thank you today.

798
01:06:24,883 --> 01:06:26,258
Thank you, friend.

799
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:54,092
I got my prize. What do you want?

800
01:07:11,008 --> 01:07:12,133
Who is it?

801
01:07:18,383 --> 01:07:21,383
What are you doing here?
And what's that in your hands?

802
01:07:21,675 --> 01:07:23,967
It's the wall for our toilet, Baba.

803
01:07:24,258 --> 01:07:26,092
Get down, Baba.

804
01:07:26,300 --> 01:07:27,258
There's more.

805
01:07:27,342 --> 01:07:28,217
Give us a hand.

806
01:07:32,550 --> 01:07:34,050
Fine, I am coming.

807
01:07:37,925 --> 01:07:38,925
Okay?

808
01:07:39,842 --> 01:07:42,425
Baba, inaugurate it.

809
01:07:44,050 --> 01:07:46,008
Take a seat inside.

810
01:07:54,342 --> 01:07:56,800
-Isn't it nice?
-How is it?

811
01:07:56,883 --> 01:08:01,550
Covered by walls on all sides,
and the open sky above.

812
01:08:01,633 --> 01:08:03,050
Amazing!

813
01:08:07,133 --> 01:08:11,842
All it's missing to make it a heaven
is a toilet bowl!

814
01:08:16,008 --> 01:08:17,383
Bowl...

815
01:08:25,925 --> 01:08:27,633
Ma'am, you can get this
at a discounted price.

816
01:08:28,217 --> 01:08:32,258
-What's the discount?
-Ma'am 20%. Take it.

817
01:08:33,342 --> 01:08:34,342
Wait.

818
01:08:36,133 --> 01:08:37,592
-This one.
-You like this one.

819
01:08:37,717 --> 01:08:38,550
Yes.

820
01:08:42,425 --> 01:08:44,050
-Excuse me, ma'am.
-Okay

821
01:08:50,508 --> 01:08:51,800
Sir, I see you're back.

822
01:08:52,092 --> 01:08:54,467
-So, is this your choice, sir?
-Yes.

823
01:08:54,550 --> 01:08:57,633
-Very good choice, sir. It is made of...
-Stop... Not again.

824
01:08:57,925 --> 01:09:00,050
Haven't you practiced enough?

825
01:09:01,758 --> 01:09:02,842
How much will it cost?

826
01:09:02,925 --> 01:09:06,800
-Sir, it's...
-Hey. Don't say that it's "priceless."

827
01:09:07,550 --> 01:09:09,050
Just tell us the price.

828
01:09:09,133 --> 01:09:12,092
Sir, it's 10,000.
Do you want to buy it?

829
01:09:12,175 --> 01:09:15,883
That price will make anyone constipated.

830
01:09:15,967 --> 01:09:19,050
You know what?
There's a cheaper one behind.

831
01:09:19,133 --> 01:09:21,050
It's only 7000. Take that.

832
01:09:22,217 --> 01:09:23,675
Now that feels better.

833
01:09:25,050 --> 01:09:29,133
-Pichku, that one's nice too.
-No, I want this one.

834
01:09:31,467 --> 01:09:33,800
Please reserve it for us.

835
01:09:34,883 --> 01:09:37,800
Don't give it to anyone.

836
01:09:37,883 --> 01:09:40,883
Come on, sir. How can I do that?

837
01:09:40,967 --> 01:09:44,133
If a customer comes and pays for it,
I'll have to sell it, right?

838
01:09:44,383 --> 01:09:47,258
Also, it's high on demand,
and this is the last in stock.

839
01:09:47,342 --> 01:09:49,217
We'll save money.

840
01:09:49,467 --> 01:09:52,383
When we have enough,
we'll give it to you.

841
01:09:52,467 --> 01:09:55,550
-But please take care of it until then.
-Have you lost your mind?

842
01:09:55,883 --> 01:09:57,592
How will we manage 10,000 rupees?

843
01:09:58,467 --> 01:10:00,800
We can't dream of it.
It's beyond our means.

844
01:10:00,883 --> 01:10:01,967
Come to your senses.

845
01:10:02,967 --> 01:10:04,217
Let's get out of here.

846
01:10:04,383 --> 01:10:06,675
-Okay, Mr. Priceless, see you later.
-Okay.

847
01:10:06,758 --> 01:10:09,842
-No, I want that one.
-Ten thousand is a big amount.

848
01:10:10,050 --> 01:10:11,800
-How will we arrange it?
-Wait.

849
01:10:13,133 --> 01:10:14,092
Hold on.

850
01:10:15,842 --> 01:10:18,133
Look. You're my first customer.

851
01:10:18,592 --> 01:10:22,717
So what you can do is that you can buy
that toilet seat in my name.

852
01:10:23,175 --> 01:10:25,967
You'll get a 25% employee discount too.

853
01:10:26,467 --> 01:10:31,633
-What do you mean?
-What I mean is, you can get it for 7500.

854
01:10:33,633 --> 01:10:35,800
-Sevety-five hundred!
-Yes.

855
01:10:41,717 --> 01:10:44,925
-Here's the advance, 850.
-Advance?

856
01:10:47,300 --> 01:10:48,675
Eight hundred fifty.

857
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:51,217
-How much is this?
-Three hundred.

858
01:10:51,633 --> 01:10:53,092
Now count what's the advance.

859
01:10:54,383 --> 01:10:55,717
Eleven hundred fifty.

860
01:10:58,383 --> 01:11:01,925
So, you've paid me 1150;
you've to pay me 6350 more.

861
01:11:02,008 --> 01:11:06,842
And, as you can see, I've already
noted it down, with my signature.

862
01:11:06,925 --> 01:11:10,008
-Give us the receipt.
-You're so excited for the receipt, huh?

863
01:11:10,508 --> 01:11:11,425
Here.

864
01:11:17,217 --> 01:11:20,550
-How much do these cost?
-They're free for you, sir.

865
01:11:24,342 --> 01:11:25,300
Come on, Gopi.

866
01:11:37,633 --> 01:11:42,092
<i>The tears are yet warm</i>
<i>Lightning streaks through the eyes</i>

867
01:11:42,592 --> 01:11:47,383
<i>There's an itch in the head</i>
<i>That wants to be scratched</i>

868
01:11:47,758 --> 01:11:52,717
<i>The tears are yet warm</i>
<i>Lightning streaks through the eyes</i>

869
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:57,550
<i>There's an itch in the head</i>
<i>That wants to be scratched</i>

870
01:11:58,592 --> 01:12:02,300
<i>Courage is riding</i>

871
01:12:03,383 --> 01:12:08,008
<i>On the two little wheels of labor</i>

872
01:12:08,467 --> 01:12:14,050
<i>Courage is riding</i>
<i>On the two little wheels of labor</i>

873
01:12:14,175 --> 01:12:17,217
<i>-The horizon doesn't look so far away!</i>
-Here.

874
01:12:18,342 --> 01:12:19,300
Amazing.

875
01:12:19,383 --> 01:12:24,342
<i>-Hey, good man</i>
<i>-Luck will shine upon you</i>

876
01:12:24,425 --> 01:12:29,342
<i>Now that so much is going on</i>
<i>In that little head!</i>

877
01:12:29,425 --> 01:12:32,217
<i>-Hey, good man</i>
<i>-Luck will shine upon you</i>

878
01:12:34,550 --> 01:12:41,550
<i>Now that you've put this burden</i>
<i>On your little head</i>

879
01:13:03,258 --> 01:13:08,092
<i>People build their dream castles</i>

880
01:13:08,592 --> 01:13:13,092
<i>They build them so grand</i>

881
01:13:13,508 --> 01:13:18,300
<i>But we write our dreams with little pens</i>

882
01:13:18,717 --> 01:13:22,925
<i>And they are just as grand</i>

883
01:13:23,008 --> 01:13:27,800
<i>I have seen this world, so it must be real</i>
<i>They must be building it somewhere</i>

884
01:13:27,883 --> 01:13:33,258
<i>Maybe I can see it if I soar to the sky</i>

885
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:37,967
<i>Courage is riding</i>

886
01:13:38,842 --> 01:13:43,467
<i>On the two little wheels of labor</i>

887
01:13:43,967 --> 01:13:48,883
<i>Courage is riding</i>
<i>On the two little wheels of labor</i>

888
01:13:49,425 --> 01:13:52,425
<i>The horizon doesn't look so far away!</i>

889
01:13:52,508 --> 01:13:53,925
-Pichku.
-Yes, Mom.

890
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:55,675
Pass me that pillow.

891
01:13:58,342 --> 01:14:03,425
<i>-Hey, good man</i>
<i>- Luck will shine upon you</i>

892
01:14:03,508 --> 01:14:08,342
<i>Now that so much is going on</i>
<i>In that little head!</i>

893
01:14:08,425 --> 01:14:13,550
<i>-Hey, good man</i>
<i>- Luck will shine upon you</i>

894
01:14:13,675 --> 01:14:18,217
<i>Now that so much is going on</i>
<i>In that little head!</i>

895
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:23,675
<i>-Hey, good man</i>
<i>- Luck will shine upon you</i>

896
01:14:23,758 --> 01:14:28,717
<i>Now that so much is going on</i>
<i>In that little head!</i>

897
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:33,758
<i>-Hey, good man</i>
<i>- Luck will shine upon you</i>

898
01:14:33,842 --> 01:14:40,800
<i>Now that so much is going on</i>
<i>In that little head!</i>

899
01:14:47,300 --> 01:14:49,092
Where do you go these days, son?

900
01:14:57,300 --> 01:15:00,133
My child, once your father
buys his auto-rickshaw,

901
01:15:00,217 --> 01:15:02,217
we'll build a toilet for you, okay?

902
01:15:03,383 --> 01:15:04,383
Eat it.

903
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:15,050
Tea's ready, just pour the milk.

904
01:15:21,092 --> 01:15:25,800
-Shobha! Shobha, did you go out?
-Yes!

905
01:15:26,425 --> 01:15:29,008
I've given the money to Uncle Sudhakar.

906
01:15:29,092 --> 01:15:32,300
So he was alone at home.
Where did you hide it?

907
01:15:33,425 --> 01:15:35,508
-What?
-What? Can't you smell the stench?

908
01:15:35,592 --> 01:15:36,550
Come inside.

909
01:15:40,675 --> 01:15:42,883
Yes, it is stinking.

910
01:15:42,967 --> 01:15:44,092
Pichku.

911
01:15:44,758 --> 01:15:46,508
-He's getting naughtier by the day.
-Yes, Mom.

912
01:15:49,758 --> 01:15:53,133
-I haven't done anything.
-Look, look. Look at his face.

913
01:15:53,258 --> 01:15:54,675
How he's trying to act innocent.

914
01:15:55,133 --> 01:15:56,758
-I'll slap...
-Don't hit him!

915
01:15:56,842 --> 01:15:58,592
Maybe it was an emergency,
that's why he did it.

916
01:15:59,842 --> 01:16:02,592
Pichku, I've tried to make you understand
so many times.

917
01:16:02,675 --> 01:16:04,300
Why don't you listen to me?

918
01:16:04,550 --> 01:16:07,008
-Tell me.
-I didn't do anything, Mom.

919
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:09,592
See, I haven't even lighted
the incense sticks.

920
01:16:09,675 --> 01:16:11,050
So where's this smell coming from?

921
01:16:11,133 --> 01:16:14,967
-Tell the truth, son. Where is it?
-I swear I didn't do it.

922
01:16:15,050 --> 01:16:17,133
Okay, don't cry.

923
01:16:18,425 --> 01:16:19,550
Look around! Check!

924
01:16:24,258 --> 01:16:25,092
Yuck!

925
01:16:26,175 --> 01:16:27,383
Here. See for yourself.

926
01:16:27,467 --> 01:16:30,508
You're the one who brought it,
and you're scolding my child.

927
01:16:31,258 --> 01:16:33,758
Stupid people, they do it anywhere.

928
01:16:33,883 --> 01:16:36,425
-Pichku, go wash it.
-Why should he do it?

929
01:16:36,508 --> 01:16:38,425
You brought it, you clean it!

930
01:16:39,967 --> 01:16:42,425
-Ramesh Ram.
-That's him.

931
01:16:43,217 --> 01:16:45,050
You took money to build a toilet,
didn't you?

932
01:16:45,342 --> 01:16:46,758
-So?
-Did you build it?

933
01:16:47,175 --> 01:16:48,758
But you got your share.

934
01:16:49,050 --> 01:16:50,925
Now you read this notice.

935
01:16:51,008 --> 01:16:53,383
Build a toilet, or pay back 12,000.

936
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:55,092
Why should I pay back?

937
01:16:55,175 --> 01:16:58,217
Oh, God. What's this?
But didn't you get only 6,000?

938
01:17:00,217 --> 01:17:01,758
-Not those slippers again.
-Wait, mister.

939
01:17:01,842 --> 01:17:03,675
-At least clean it first.
-Mister...

940
01:17:08,717 --> 01:17:10,217
Wait, I'll tell you.

941
01:17:18,758 --> 01:17:20,675
Listen, the new officer is very strict.

942
01:17:20,758 --> 01:17:21,800
-Mister...
-Yeah.

943
01:17:21,883 --> 01:17:24,425
I got only 6,000,
so why should I give 12,000?

944
01:17:24,508 --> 01:17:26,092
Then build a toilet.

945
01:17:26,467 --> 01:17:29,550
We're prepared to pay more
to settle this once and for all.

946
01:17:29,633 --> 01:17:31,925
We have a new officer,
don't even mention such a thing.

947
01:17:37,008 --> 01:17:39,175
What kind of a joke is this?

948
01:17:39,967 --> 01:17:42,217
Somewhere it's mentioned six toilets,
somewhere it's eight.

949
01:17:43,050 --> 01:17:44,217
Show me one.

950
01:17:44,383 --> 01:17:45,550
We're in trouble now.

951
01:17:45,675 --> 01:17:48,383
I won't let anyone swindle this money.

952
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:50,383
-Solanki, come here.
-Yes, sir.

953
01:17:52,592 --> 01:17:54,383
-Did you serve everyone the notice?
-Yes, sir.

954
01:17:56,133 --> 01:17:59,175
Look, I don't want you
to return the money.

955
01:17:59,758 --> 01:18:04,258
But the next time I come here,
I want to see a toilet in every home.

956
01:18:04,925 --> 01:18:06,092
Damn.

957
01:18:06,592 --> 01:18:09,217
You guys need the money. Take it.

958
01:18:09,300 --> 01:18:12,008
But you must use it properly.

959
01:18:12,883 --> 01:18:14,383
I am warning you again!

960
01:18:14,467 --> 01:18:15,758
I won't let anyone...

961
01:18:16,717 --> 01:18:18,008
swindle...

962
01:18:19,508 --> 01:18:20,633
the government's money.

963
01:18:20,925 --> 01:18:22,342
-He's the right guy.
-Zero corruption.

964
01:18:22,467 --> 01:18:25,383
I want a toilet in every home, got it?

965
01:18:28,925 --> 01:18:29,800
The tea's gone cold.

966
01:18:29,883 --> 01:18:32,175
<i>I am crazy about you</i>

967
01:18:33,633 --> 01:18:37,508
-Sir... how are you?
-You two? Again?

968
01:18:37,967 --> 01:18:39,675
You won't mend your ways, will you?

969
01:18:39,758 --> 01:18:43,050
-Pichku, let's go to the new officer.
-Hey.

970
01:18:43,133 --> 01:18:46,092
-Listen, listen.
-It's okay. We don't want a toilet.

971
01:18:46,175 --> 01:18:49,092
-I beg you. Come on.
-We'll go and tell him.

972
01:18:49,383 --> 01:18:51,133
Come on, son. Come here.

973
01:18:51,217 --> 01:18:54,008
Forgive me. We all make mistakes.

974
01:18:54,508 --> 01:18:55,425
Sit.

975
01:18:55,717 --> 01:18:58,633
Look who's here, sir. Hot tea.
Shall I give them too?

976
01:18:59,008 --> 01:19:01,217
-Have it, son, please.
-Here you go.

977
01:19:01,675 --> 01:19:03,758
-Have some bananas too.
-Take it, Pichku.

978
01:19:03,842 --> 01:19:05,092
Take it, son.

979
01:19:07,633 --> 01:19:09,550
Why bother him for such a small task?

980
01:19:09,633 --> 01:19:12,800
-We want the money for the toilet.
-Of course, son. You'll get it.

981
01:19:13,175 --> 01:19:15,758
-Listen, Solanki.
-Yes, sir.

982
01:19:15,842 --> 01:19:17,508
-Bring a form.
-Give it.

983
01:19:17,592 --> 01:19:20,800
-It's okay. I already have it.
-Wow, sir. They already have it.

984
01:19:20,883 --> 01:19:23,092
I see. Wonderful.

985
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:26,717
What is this?

986
01:19:28,467 --> 01:19:30,717
"Ali Mehendi Zaidi."

987
01:19:33,008 --> 01:19:34,550
"Address..."

988
01:19:47,008 --> 01:19:49,133
What's wrong, sir?
Why are you laughing?

989
01:19:54,133 --> 01:19:55,342
What's wrong, sir?

990
01:20:06,592 --> 01:20:08,633
The address on your ration card
is Lucknow.

991
01:20:14,383 --> 01:20:15,842
Sorry, it's my mistake.

992
01:20:15,925 --> 01:20:18,925
He said,
"Go! Build your toilet in Lucknow."

993
01:20:19,300 --> 01:20:20,800
It's all your fault.

994
01:20:20,883 --> 01:20:23,550
Don't lose hope. We'll find a way.

995
01:20:28,967 --> 01:20:29,925
Let's go, Pichku.

996
01:20:30,425 --> 01:20:31,425
Where?

997
01:20:36,175 --> 01:20:38,342
-We don't want to see you again.
-But...

998
01:20:39,008 --> 01:20:40,008
Kids...

999
01:20:41,342 --> 01:20:43,883
Wait... Kids.

1000
01:20:54,675 --> 01:20:56,300
Five times seven is thirty-five!

1001
01:20:56,425 --> 01:20:58,258
Five times eight is forty!

1002
01:20:58,342 --> 01:21:00,300
Five times nine is forty-five!

1003
01:21:00,383 --> 01:21:02,175
Five times ten is fifty!

1004
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:23,050
Hurry up.

1005
01:21:26,883 --> 01:21:27,800
Here.

1006
01:21:28,883 --> 01:21:29,925
Wait.

1007
01:21:38,925 --> 01:21:40,800
Kids!

1008
01:21:46,008 --> 01:21:47,175
Kids!

1009
01:21:48,008 --> 01:21:49,008
Come here.

1010
01:21:50,300 --> 01:21:51,342
Baba.

1011
01:21:51,717 --> 01:21:53,008
-Let's go.
-Come.

1012
01:22:09,258 --> 01:22:10,258
Come here.

1013
01:22:23,050 --> 01:22:24,633
Oh, my!

1014
01:22:26,550 --> 01:22:28,967
Wow. Did you hit a jackpot, sir?

1015
01:22:29,050 --> 01:22:31,175
-Now, what's the balance?
-Just a minute.

1016
01:22:36,467 --> 01:22:41,342
-You still have to pay 3150.
-Can't you cover it for us, Mr. Priceless?

1017
01:22:41,425 --> 01:22:44,675
I gave you an employee discount.
That's all I can do.

1018
01:22:45,008 --> 01:22:47,967
Besides, you've almost paid
the full amount.

1019
01:22:48,258 --> 01:22:50,883
Now don't lose hope, okay.

1020
01:22:51,717 --> 01:22:52,842
All the best.

1021
01:23:19,383 --> 01:23:21,342
"...connect it with this pipe."

1022
01:23:21,425 --> 01:23:22,633
Such a big pit!

1023
01:23:23,050 --> 01:23:25,550
And then water gushes in and... flushed!

1024
01:23:42,008 --> 01:23:42,883
Oh, no. Ramesh.

1025
01:23:44,383 --> 01:23:45,717
Hide, Pichku.

1026
01:24:03,842 --> 01:24:06,008
Six, seven, eight...

1027
01:24:06,842 --> 01:24:10,258
You keep so much cash at home,
it makes me nervous.

1028
01:24:10,508 --> 01:24:14,050
Shobha, my darling,
another 5000 rupees,

1029
01:24:14,133 --> 01:24:16,133
and then we'll have our own auto-rickshaw.

1030
01:24:16,425 --> 01:24:19,050
And won't you return the money
for the toilet?

1031
01:24:19,383 --> 01:24:22,217
-No one's doing that.
-But everyone's returning the money, Dad.

1032
01:24:22,342 --> 01:24:23,967
It's all empty words.

1033
01:24:24,050 --> 01:24:27,633
People only come here for votes, not cash.

1034
01:24:27,842 --> 01:24:29,300
What if the police arrest you?

1035
01:24:29,383 --> 01:24:33,467
If they arrest people for 6000 rupees,
then the entire slum will be in jail.

1036
01:24:33,550 --> 01:24:35,592
It's not 6000, it's 12000.

1037
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:37,092
Don't worry.

1038
01:24:37,467 --> 01:24:38,883
Son, pass me the pillow.

1039
01:24:39,258 --> 01:24:40,467
Turn off the light.

1040
01:24:55,425 --> 01:24:56,383
Mom.

1041
01:24:57,383 --> 01:24:58,425
Mom.

1042
01:25:00,925 --> 01:25:02,842
Mom, don't tell Dad.

1043
01:25:03,675 --> 01:25:06,550
What? Did you do it again at home?

1044
01:25:06,633 --> 01:25:08,217
No! Not that.

1045
01:25:09,883 --> 01:25:12,550
We're building a toilet.

1046
01:25:13,050 --> 01:25:15,383
Fine. Go to sleep.

1047
01:25:15,758 --> 01:25:18,008
Mom, seriously, we're building a toilet.

1048
01:25:18,092 --> 01:25:22,300
-Gopi is helping me too.
-Fine. Go to sleep.

1049
01:25:49,925 --> 01:25:50,842
Mom.

1050
01:25:51,175 --> 01:25:52,133
Mom.

1051
01:25:55,425 --> 01:25:56,467
This is the one.

1052
01:25:59,092 --> 01:26:01,883
I saw it in the school. This one.

1053
01:26:03,758 --> 01:26:05,258
And here are the receipts.

1054
01:26:16,175 --> 01:26:18,883
Where did you get so much money?

1055
01:26:19,925 --> 01:26:21,967
-We saved up.
-Really?

1056
01:26:24,258 --> 01:26:28,300
-And where are you building this toilet?
-That's a secret.

1057
01:26:31,300 --> 01:26:33,092
We're almost through
with the construction.

1058
01:26:33,758 --> 01:26:37,175
-Just the commode...
-What?

1059
01:26:37,258 --> 01:26:39,467
Commode, western toilet.

1060
01:26:39,550 --> 01:26:41,883
We're short of cash to buy it.

1061
01:26:42,842 --> 01:26:44,300
How much more do you need?

1062
01:26:46,425 --> 01:26:48,300
Three thousand one hundred and fifty.

1063
01:26:51,925 --> 01:26:53,425
Don't press the clutch too hard.

1064
01:26:53,758 --> 01:26:55,508
-Am I doing it properly?
-Yes.

1065
01:26:55,592 --> 01:26:57,633
-I should press on it lightly, right?
-Yes.

1066
01:26:57,925 --> 01:26:59,092
Just a minute.

1067
01:26:59,425 --> 01:27:02,050
Where's the gang going?

1068
01:27:02,133 --> 01:27:05,217
Oh, God. Did you buy it?

1069
01:27:05,300 --> 01:27:07,133
I am just learning to drive. Get in.

1070
01:27:07,217 --> 01:27:09,008
-Let's get in, Mom.
-What if you crash it?

1071
01:27:09,092 --> 01:27:11,883
So what? We'll live together,
we'll die together.

1072
01:27:11,967 --> 01:27:13,675
-Let's go, Mom.
-Fine, let's go.

1073
01:27:15,633 --> 01:27:17,508
-Gopi, we're in an auto-rickshaw!
-Let's go.

1074
01:27:20,467 --> 01:27:21,758
Look, I am driving too.

1075
01:27:27,008 --> 01:27:29,258
Don't tell Dad, okay?

1076
01:27:29,342 --> 01:27:30,675
This will be our secret.

1077
01:27:30,758 --> 01:27:31,883
-Yes, Mom.
-Okay.

1078
01:27:34,383 --> 01:27:35,675
Come, Gopi.

1079
01:27:35,758 --> 01:27:37,883
Shobha, he's Pichku, right?

1080
01:27:38,300 --> 01:27:40,467
Yes, you haven't seen him in a while.

1081
01:27:40,550 --> 01:27:42,717
-Wait here. I'll be right back.
-Okay.

1082
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:43,842
I'll be back in a moment.

1083
01:27:47,383 --> 01:27:48,758
What is she making?

1084
01:27:49,425 --> 01:27:50,883
Isn't that double jasmine?

1085
01:27:51,258 --> 01:27:52,550
No, it's jasmine.

1086
01:27:54,508 --> 01:27:58,175
Here, I only got 1500.
I'll give the rest later.

1087
01:27:58,717 --> 01:28:00,800
-Mom.
-My darling son.

1088
01:28:05,675 --> 01:28:07,925
What's the matter? Get lost!

1089
01:28:08,883 --> 01:28:11,758
-Where's Kapil?
-Kapil? Who's he?

1090
01:28:12,217 --> 01:28:13,842
The guy who used to work here.

1091
01:28:13,925 --> 01:28:16,300
I work here, nobody else.
Understand?

1092
01:28:16,508 --> 01:28:18,300
-Now get lost.
-Let go off me.

1093
01:28:18,425 --> 01:28:19,758
Hey!

1094
01:28:19,842 --> 01:28:21,758
-Stop. Wait.
-You stay there.

1095
01:28:21,842 --> 01:28:26,258
Wait! Stop! Stop!

1096
01:28:27,008 --> 01:28:29,925
-Sir, these two...
-Hold on.

1097
01:28:30,133 --> 01:28:34,467
-Sir, Kapil...
-Kapil? He quit his job.

1098
01:28:39,258 --> 01:28:40,133
What happened?

1099
01:28:40,925 --> 01:28:44,550
Sir, we had given him money
for our toilet.

1100
01:28:45,883 --> 01:28:47,592
And we have brought the rest.

1101
01:28:48,383 --> 01:28:51,842
You can keep it,
but please give us our toilet, sir.

1102
01:28:52,133 --> 01:28:55,175
But, son, you gave the money to Kapil,
and he ran off with it.

1103
01:28:55,258 --> 01:28:56,800
How can I give you the toilet?

1104
01:28:57,592 --> 01:28:59,717
You can't buy a toilet
with so little money.

1105
01:29:00,175 --> 01:29:02,300
Try to understand, son.
It's not possible.

1106
01:29:02,383 --> 01:29:05,633
Please check in the computer if you
can find his address or phone number.

1107
01:29:06,383 --> 01:29:09,383
I'll check it but he was using
the company's phone.

1108
01:29:09,467 --> 01:29:10,717
I'll try anyway.

1109
01:29:12,300 --> 01:29:19,300
<i>If this world exists</i>
<i>Why can't I just ask for my wish?</i>

1110
01:29:19,592 --> 01:29:26,133
<i>If we can see our dreams</i>
<i>Why aren't they real?</i>

1111
01:29:26,967 --> 01:29:33,717
<i>When we ask our elders</i>

1112
01:29:34,342 --> 01:29:40,675
<i>Why can't they tell the truth?</i>

1113
01:29:40,758 --> 01:29:47,717
<i>Guess that's why this guy</i>
<i>Just took off with a stick</i>

1114
01:29:48,175 --> 01:29:54,883
<i>He had glasses on, but still had to trip</i>
<i>When he walked on his inevitable path</i>

1115
01:29:56,800 --> 01:30:02,467
<i>Courage is riding</i>
<i>On the two little wheels of labor</i>

1116
01:30:03,883 --> 01:30:09,717
<i>Courage is riding</i>
<i>On the two little wheels of labor</i>

1117
01:30:11,217 --> 01:30:18,092
<i>Courage is riding</i>
<i>On the two little wheels of labor</i>

1118
01:30:19,508 --> 01:30:22,758
<i>The horizon doesn't look so far away!</i>

1119
01:30:24,508 --> 01:30:26,258
<i>Hey, good man</i>

1120
01:30:26,342 --> 01:30:31,883
<i>Luck will shine upon you</i>

1121
01:30:31,967 --> 01:30:38,717
<i>Now that so much is going on</i>
<i>In that little head!</i>

1122
01:30:39,342 --> 01:30:42,383
<i>Hey, good man!</i>

1123
01:30:43,092 --> 01:30:45,842
Don't cry. Silly boy.

1124
01:30:45,925 --> 01:30:47,008
Everything will be fine.

1125
01:30:47,092 --> 01:30:51,008
<i>-I can feel it happening.</i>
-Come here. Sit.

1126
01:30:51,883 --> 01:30:53,258
You're a brave boy.

1127
01:30:54,425 --> 01:30:55,467
Boys don't cry.

1128
01:30:55,883 --> 01:30:56,800
Come on, cheer up.

1129
01:30:57,258 --> 01:30:58,717
Cheer Up. Laugh.

1130
01:31:00,008 --> 01:31:01,592
Laugh.

1131
01:31:11,883 --> 01:31:13,467
We're not going now.

1132
01:31:13,550 --> 01:31:15,717
What now, Gopi? He took all our money.

1133
01:31:15,800 --> 01:31:18,300
-Forget it. We'll save again.
-Sir!

1134
01:31:20,550 --> 01:31:23,675
-Bloody Kapil, I'll beat the...
-Ramesh! Look, it's Ramesh.

1135
01:31:23,758 --> 01:31:25,175
Sir, you wanted to go further, right?

1136
01:31:25,300 --> 01:31:26,592
-It's okay. Keep it.
-Run, Gopi.

1137
01:31:26,675 --> 01:31:28,508
-Sir!
-Run, Gopi! Quick!

1138
01:31:28,592 --> 01:31:30,550
Wait! Wait.

1139
01:31:31,050 --> 01:31:34,217
-Run, Gopi!
-Hear me out!

1140
01:31:34,592 --> 01:31:35,675
Wait!

1141
01:31:39,800 --> 01:31:41,425
Catch him, Pichku.

1142
01:31:41,842 --> 01:31:43,967
Finally, we have got our hands on you.

1143
01:31:44,467 --> 01:31:46,508
Where is our money?

1144
01:31:46,967 --> 01:31:49,758
Sir! I looked all over for you guys.

1145
01:31:51,633 --> 01:31:54,008
So Mr. Priceless, do you know

1146
01:31:54,092 --> 01:31:56,508
that we've already built the walls
and the roof?

1147
01:31:56,592 --> 01:31:58,342
And dug a big pit too.

1148
01:32:07,717 --> 01:32:11,300
So, Sir, don't you want your commode?

1149
01:32:11,633 --> 01:32:15,550
See? The one in the school?
I've kept it aside for you.

1150
01:32:17,050 --> 01:32:18,550
Where do I send it?

1151
01:33:01,800 --> 01:33:03,675
<i>God couldn't decide</i>

1152
01:33:03,800 --> 01:33:05,592
<i>So everyone paired 'em up</i>

1153
01:33:05,717 --> 01:33:09,508
<i>A lion-hearted rooster</i>
<i>And a stunning peahen</i>

1154
01:33:17,217 --> 01:33:19,008
<i>This good-for-nothing Rooster</i>

1155
01:33:19,092 --> 01:33:20,967
<i>Just been loitering around flustered</i>

1156
01:33:21,050 --> 01:33:22,883
<i>Not a bite to eat or drink</i>

1157
01:33:23,008 --> 01:33:25,050
<i>He just began to shrink</i>

1158
01:33:33,050 --> 01:33:36,425
<i>Every morning he goes</i>
<i>Cock-a-doodle-doo</i>

1159
01:33:36,883 --> 01:33:40,133
<i>What does he want, you ask</i>

1160
01:33:40,258 --> 01:33:42,550
<i>In the distance, sees the Peahen dance</i>

1161
01:33:42,633 --> 01:33:43,967
<i>And stands like a question mark</i>
<i>Asking</i>

1162
01:33:47,633 --> 01:33:49,967
<i>Peahen, Peahen!</i>

1163
01:34:14,717 --> 01:34:15,592
Pichku!

1164
01:34:34,217 --> 01:34:36,050
<i>Rooster, you're gonna lose your Peahen</i>

1165
01:34:36,175 --> 01:34:37,758
<i>Rooster, you've got slippery hands</i>

1166
01:34:37,842 --> 01:34:40,008
<i>You're a lion</i>
<i>Don't behave like a donkey</i>

1167
01:34:41,217 --> 01:34:44,050
-Gopi, where is Pichku?
-I don't know.

1168
01:34:44,133 --> 01:34:45,592
-Tell me or else...
-Near his toilet.

1169
01:34:45,717 --> 01:34:47,342
<i>Roar and holler, she'll come runnin'</i>

1170
01:34:47,425 --> 01:34:49,425
<i>Else like fate, she'll just keep turning'</i>

1171
01:34:50,883 --> 01:34:53,133
-Come with us.
-What's the matter?

1172
01:34:53,217 --> 01:34:55,258
<i>Rooster, you're gonna lose your Peahen</i>

1173
01:34:55,342 --> 01:34:56,883
<i>Rooster, you've gotta hold her tight, man!</i>

1174
01:34:56,967 --> 01:34:58,883
<i>She's pretty smart</i>

1175
01:34:58,967 --> 01:35:00,800
<i>-She dances to chartbusters</i>
-He's gone to the toilet.

1176
01:35:00,883 --> 01:35:02,717
<i>-But makes everyone dance to her tunes</i>
-Let's go.

1177
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:04,925
<i>You can't lure her easily</i>

1178
01:35:05,217 --> 01:35:08,550
<i>Every morning he goes</i>
<i>Cock-a-doodle-doo</i>

1179
01:35:09,008 --> 01:35:12,300
<i>What does he want, you ask</i>

1180
01:35:12,383 --> 01:35:14,717
<i>In the distance, sees the Peahen dance</i>

1181
01:35:14,842 --> 01:35:16,300
<i>And stands like a question mark</i>
<i>Asking</i>

1182
01:35:19,717 --> 01:35:22,175
<i>Peahen, peahen!</i>

1183
01:35:56,550 --> 01:35:59,008
Hey, stop! Where are you going?

1184
01:35:59,092 --> 01:36:00,883
What's wrong, sir?
Why are you arresting me?

1185
01:36:00,967 --> 01:36:02,217
What's happening?

1186
01:36:02,300 --> 01:36:04,008
Why are you arresting me?

1187
01:36:04,092 --> 01:36:05,675
-What happened?
-What happened?

1188
01:36:05,758 --> 01:36:07,300
-He isn't telling me.
-Why are you arresting him?

1189
01:36:07,383 --> 01:36:08,800
He didn't build his toilet.

1190
01:36:08,883 --> 01:36:11,550
-We're taking him to the court.
-But we'll build a toilet!

1191
01:36:11,633 --> 01:36:13,383
-Come with me.
-We'll build it, sir.

1192
01:36:13,467 --> 01:36:16,675
-Tell him you'll build it.
-Tell them what?

1193
01:36:17,258 --> 01:36:19,092
Your son took all my money.

1194
01:36:19,175 --> 01:36:20,592
-What are you saying?
-Yes!

1195
01:36:20,675 --> 01:36:23,258
I took that money to deposit in the bank.

1196
01:36:23,342 --> 01:36:25,008
It was giving me sleepless nights.

1197
01:36:25,092 --> 01:36:26,467
You're lying to save his hide.

1198
01:36:26,550 --> 01:36:28,050
Then see here.

1199
01:36:28,550 --> 01:36:29,467
It's my bad luck.

1200
01:36:29,550 --> 01:36:31,967
-Come.
-Wait, sir. Please wait.

1201
01:36:32,092 --> 01:36:33,883
Here... here's the money.

1202
01:36:35,092 --> 01:36:36,175
I thought Pichku...

1203
01:36:36,425 --> 01:36:37,717
Quiet, quiet.

1204
01:36:37,842 --> 01:36:40,425
Keep this money safe,
it'll come in handy to bail him out.

1205
01:36:40,508 --> 01:36:44,008
If you don't build a toilet too,
you will face the same consequence.

1206
01:36:44,383 --> 01:36:47,050
Now, he will have to serve
the court's sentence.

1207
01:36:47,133 --> 01:36:48,967
-Bring him along.
-We'll build a toilet, sir.

1208
01:36:49,050 --> 01:36:50,675
He has not done anything.

1209
01:36:50,758 --> 01:36:52,592
Why aren't you doing anything?

1210
01:36:52,925 --> 01:36:55,508
Sir, please forgive me.

1211
01:36:55,592 --> 01:36:56,925
Sir, please don't take him!

1212
01:36:57,008 --> 01:36:58,342
Wait, sir!

1213
01:36:58,425 --> 01:37:00,175
Help him, help him!

1214
01:37:00,258 --> 01:37:02,133
-Bring him along.
-Please stay back.

1215
01:37:02,217 --> 01:37:04,967
-Sir! Sir!
-Sir, please wait.

1216
01:37:05,175 --> 01:37:06,633
Stay back, stay back.

1217
01:37:06,717 --> 01:37:09,092
-Sir, don't take my father away.
-Why?

1218
01:37:11,092 --> 01:37:13,633
-Because we've already built a toilet.
-You did?

1219
01:37:13,758 --> 01:37:15,133
-Yes.
-Sir, he's my son.

1220
01:37:15,550 --> 01:37:17,800
He's just making it up. He built it,
but I broke it down.

1221
01:37:17,883 --> 01:37:20,758
Wait, wait. Pichku, what did you say?

1222
01:37:21,425 --> 01:37:23,508
Yes, here he is.

1223
01:37:23,633 --> 01:37:24,758
-Just a minute.
-Be gentle.

1224
01:37:24,842 --> 01:37:26,175
Sir, I know him well.

1225
01:37:26,258 --> 01:37:28,092
Believe me. I'll make him tell the truth.

1226
01:37:28,508 --> 01:37:30,050
Hey, where's the other boy?

1227
01:37:30,133 --> 01:37:31,758
-Sir, he...
-Where is he?

1228
01:37:32,050 --> 01:37:33,883
-I know him, sir.
-He's just a kid, sir.

1229
01:37:34,008 --> 01:37:35,842
I know what kind of a kid he is.

1230
01:37:36,092 --> 01:37:37,925
Where is the other boy? There he is.

1231
01:37:38,258 --> 01:37:39,800
-Sir...
-Yes.

1232
01:37:39,883 --> 01:37:41,467
Sir, I know how to talk to them.

1233
01:37:41,550 --> 01:37:44,800
-So, in whose name did you build it?
-Ramesh Ram.

1234
01:37:45,383 --> 01:37:48,342
He is lying.
He is lying through his teeth.

1235
01:37:48,425 --> 01:37:50,425
Didn't you mention a different name
in the form?

1236
01:37:51,342 --> 01:37:52,967
Solanki, give me the file.

1237
01:37:53,050 --> 01:37:54,258
-Here, sir.
-Pichku.

1238
01:37:54,342 --> 01:37:56,425
-See, sir. I've evidence.
-That's enough, Pushpender.

1239
01:37:56,508 --> 01:37:58,217
-Sir...
-Show me where's the toilet.

1240
01:37:58,300 --> 01:37:59,383
-But, sir.
-Be quiet.

1241
01:37:59,467 --> 01:38:01,092
-Sir...
-Where are you taking us, Pichku?

1242
01:38:01,175 --> 01:38:02,425
There's no toilet, sir.

1243
01:38:03,217 --> 01:38:04,633
Where are you taking us?

1244
01:38:06,300 --> 01:38:08,342
-I know this kid very well.
-Careful.

1245
01:38:10,467 --> 01:38:11,758
Keep moving.

1246
01:38:11,842 --> 01:38:14,175
I had asked you to return the money,
but you didn't listen.

1247
01:38:15,258 --> 01:38:18,175
They haven't built anything.
They are fooling us.

1248
01:38:18,883 --> 01:38:20,550
Listen to me...

1249
01:38:21,425 --> 01:38:24,008
All he was asking for was a toilet.

1250
01:38:28,258 --> 01:38:29,967
Look, sir.

1251
01:38:31,425 --> 01:38:33,258
-This way, sir.
-See? Nothing.

1252
01:38:33,675 --> 01:38:35,675
-What's going on?
-He's just fooling us.

1253
01:38:36,633 --> 01:38:37,800
Pichku?

1254
01:38:41,175 --> 01:38:42,800
-Come with me, Mom.
-What are you doing?

1255
01:38:42,883 --> 01:38:43,717
Come on.

1256
01:38:43,800 --> 01:38:45,592
-Where are you taking me?
-Just come with me.

1257
01:38:58,883 --> 01:39:00,050
What is this, Pichku?

1258
01:39:01,967 --> 01:39:03,675
Hold this, Mom.

1259
01:39:06,508 --> 01:39:08,092
It's nothing.

1260
01:39:10,425 --> 01:39:12,300
What is all this, Pichku?

1261
01:39:34,842 --> 01:39:36,800
Amazing. It's amazing.

1262
01:39:36,883 --> 01:39:38,925
Pichku is amazing.

1263
01:39:39,175 --> 01:39:40,925
Pichku, it's very nice.

1264
01:39:52,633 --> 01:39:54,175
This is your toilet!

1265
01:40:10,550 --> 01:40:14,092
<i>These sweet scents</i>

1266
01:40:14,217 --> 01:40:17,342
<i>These sweet scents</i>

1267
01:40:54,383 --> 01:40:57,133
Even I don't have such a nice toilet
in my house.

1268
01:41:06,883 --> 01:41:08,633
You saved me, Pichku.

1269
01:41:26,133 --> 01:41:27,092
Smile, please.

1270
01:41:41,342 --> 01:41:42,342
Hey, Pichku.

1271
01:41:47,425 --> 01:41:48,633
Give it.

1272
01:41:58,300 --> 01:42:00,508
Isn't that our stage set?

1273
01:42:00,883 --> 01:42:02,217
Stop, stop!

1274
01:42:09,008 --> 01:42:11,550
Pichku, you did an awesome job.
It's really awesome.

1275
01:42:24,925 --> 01:42:29,467
<i>What I had never seen before</i>
<i>Even in a picture</i>

1276
01:42:32,300 --> 01:42:36,675
<i>I'm seeing them in glimpses now</i>

1277
01:42:39,717 --> 01:42:43,883
<i>This dream is as real as it gets</i>

1278
01:42:46,467 --> 01:42:51,133
<i>Let me fill myself with its fragrance</i>

1279
01:42:53,675 --> 01:42:57,300
<i>I see windows in the sky</i>

1280
01:42:57,633 --> 01:43:00,633
<i>And clouds for stairs</i>

1281
01:43:01,050 --> 01:43:03,008
<i>And from a high balcony above</i>

1282
01:43:03,092 --> 01:43:07,467
<i>Fairies seem to sprinkle</i>

1283
01:43:07,592 --> 01:43:10,592
<i>These sweet scents</i>

1284
01:43:22,425 --> 01:43:25,758
<i>They're bliss, they're heady</i>

1285
01:43:26,092 --> 01:43:28,675
<i>They're floating miracles</i>

1286
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:32,092
<i>These sweet scents</i>

1287
01:43:55,383 --> 01:44:01,925
<i>Dreams playing hide-and-seek</i>

1288
01:44:02,467 --> 01:44:09,008
<i>They were hiding</i>
<i>I found them, now it's my turn!</i>

1289
01:44:09,758 --> 01:44:16,550
<i>This colorful castle, rows</i>
<i>And rows of flowers</i>

1290
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:22,800
<i>My wide eyes can just stare</i>
<i>And stare without tiring</i>

1291
01:44:22,925 --> 01:44:24,675
<i>They just touched me</i>

1292
01:44:24,758 --> 01:44:26,425
<i>And ran ahead, so I</i>

1293
01:44:26,508 --> 01:44:30,050
<i>Just impulsively</i>
<i>Ran behind them agog</i>

1294
01:44:30,133 --> 01:44:31,800
<i>Found the dreams in some boxes</i>

1295
01:44:31,925 --> 01:44:33,592
<i>Which I sorted away safely</i>

1296
01:44:33,675 --> 01:44:37,342
<i>Only to open them</i>
<i>When I feel alone again!</i>

1297
01:44:37,508 --> 01:44:41,092
<i>I see windows in the sky</i>

1298
01:44:41,592 --> 01:44:44,592
<i>And clouds for stairs</i>

1299
01:44:44,675 --> 01:44:50,550
<i>Fairies showing me the way</i>

<i>These sweet scents</i>

1304
01:45:28,550 --> 01:45:35,300
<i>How did I reach my destination</i>
<i>Even before the journey began?</i>

1305
01:45:35,675 --> 01:45:42,092
<i>How is there magic in the air</i>
<i>Without any chanting?</i>

1306
01:45:42,883 --> 01:45:49,508
<i>Let me stare at and know all the colors</i>

1307
01:45:50,050 --> 01:45:56,133
<i>Let me click a picture</i>
<i>Even before I see it</i>

1308
01:45:56,217 --> 01:45:59,508
<i>I see windows in the sky</i>
