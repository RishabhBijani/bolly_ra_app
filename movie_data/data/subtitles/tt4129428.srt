1
00:01:57,684 --> 00:02:02,690
(Purulia Folk Song)

2
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:21,578
There's the first signal.

3
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:27,149
That's the second.

4
00:02:27,381 --> 00:02:28,758
Waiting on the third.

5
00:02:33,387 --> 00:02:35,128
There it is.
Deploy! Deploy!

6
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:36,490
Go... go... go!

7
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:37,695
That's our final signal.
Let's go.

8
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:40,136
Drop it, drop it. Fast!

9
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,490
A shower of weapons in broad daylight.

10
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:34,526
17th December 1995...

11
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:37,027
It was just another day
for the villagers of Velamor.

12
00:03:37,084 --> 00:03:39,030
The farmers were heading
to their fields when suddenly...

13
00:03:39,086 --> 00:03:39,791
Big huge umbrellas!

14
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:40,724
In the Purulia district
of West Bengal...

15
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:43,666
This raises serious concerns
about India's internal security.

16
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:46,068
A foreign aircraft has breached
the Indian airspace

17
00:03:46,126 --> 00:03:47,571
dodging radars et al.

18
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:49,368
For who? How did this cache of arms

19
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:50,737
reach a village so small?

20
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:53,403
Who do these guns belong to?
What's the plan?

21
00:03:53,467 --> 00:03:55,140
The village is not a terrorist camp!

22
00:03:55,202 --> 00:03:57,773
No guns can feed hunger.

23
00:03:58,672 --> 00:04:01,278
We are the largest imponers
of arms in the world.

24
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:03,184
The whole system is corrupt.

25
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:05,190
Hand in glove waiting to erupt.

26
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,246
This isjust the tip...

27
00:04:06,313 --> 00:04:07,417
The tip ofthe iceberg.

28
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:08,983
The tip ofthe iceberg!

29
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:10,619
A bullet is cheaper than bread.

30
00:04:10,684 --> 00:04:12,493
Questions unasked,
answers unsaid.

31
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:14,122
Purulia... Purulia...

32
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:15,561
Purulia arms drop!

33
00:04:50,557 --> 00:04:53,766
Jagga Jasoos and his magical world.

34
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:57,031
Fabulous characters
and stories unfurled.

35
00:04:57,097 --> 00:05:00,738
Breaking out of his
own comic books page.

36
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:04,078
What if he pops up on the stage?

37
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:07,141
Let me present to you
the new book ofthe series,

38
00:05:07,174 --> 00:05:10,712
Jagga Jasoos and the
Magic ofthe Red Circle.

00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,647

Read and share,
make your friends aware.

46

And get a special bonus for this task:

47
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:32,405
an autographed Jagga mask!

48
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,669
Okay guys, it's all ven/ informal
and interactive.

49
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:38,011
Any doubts, just ask me. Okay?

50
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:40,278
So, let us staﬂ with the first...

51
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:43,076
First book!

52
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:45,715
Jagga Jasoos and the...
- Ma'am, ma'am!

53
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:49,184
He is saying that
this autograph is a fake.

54
00:05:49,249 --> 00:05:51,024
No, it is real.

55
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:52,586
Is Jagga for real?

56
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:56,563
He is ven/ real!
As real as your dimple.

57
00:05:57,057 --> 00:06:01,096
Just like the sound ofthis piano,
Jagga too is real.

58
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,269
You've forced me to change my plans.

59
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:07,408
Okay guys... change in plans.

60
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:09,680
Let us rewind a little.

61
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,976
To Jagga's childhood.

62
00:06:14,608 --> 00:06:17,612
Somewhere in Mainaguri,
in a hospital teeny,

63
00:06:17,644 --> 00:06:20,625
the matron found a child whiny weeny.

64
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,990
In an accident he
lost his mom and dad,

65
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,256
was left all alone, lonely and sad.

66
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:30,593
No one came for him,
passed days and years.

67
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:36,062
The hospital became
Jagga's little universe.

68
00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:39,409
Riding moon's back,
piggyback like a sack.

69
00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:41,639
To a world where he's not alone,

70
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:44,346
here comes Jagga.

71
00:06:47,641 --> 00:06:50,247
A piece of candy,
face all dandy,

72
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:52,381
in a style of his own,

73
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:55,150
here comes Jagga.

74
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,394
A gift from above,

75
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,100
forming bonds of love,

76
00:07:03,323 --> 00:07:05,701
tugs at your head,

77
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,333
as he goes about mingling.

78
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:11,337
With eyes almost weeping,

79
00:07:11,398 --> 00:07:13,742
under the stairs,
you'll catch him sleeping.

80
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:16,545
A teeny weeny cot,

81
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:19,206
a pint sized little thing.

82
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:22,310
Riding moon's back,
piggyback like a sack,

83
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,548
to a world where he's not alone,

84
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:27,247
here comes Jagga.

85
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:32,722
He's one of a kind,

86
00:07:32,986 --> 00:07:35,466
with a head that's divine.

87
00:07:35,522 --> 00:07:38,298
Sleepless he lies on lonely nights,

88
00:07:38,358 --> 00:07:40,736
counting the stars that shine.

89
00:07:41,428 --> 00:07:43,567
Bottled within,

90
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,543
he's bubbling with tales.

91
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:49,170
But when it comes to talking,

92
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:51,306
his tongue fails.

93
00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:54,215
Jagga!

94
00:07:54,274 --> 00:07:57,050
Though a little devil,

95
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,420
his head is not a wee bit bad.

96
00:07:59,713 --> 00:08:02,125
Oh, he is a lovely lad.

97
00:08:02,182 --> 00:08:04,321
Jagga!

98
00:08:13,727 --> 00:08:18,727
If it's decided, for two souls
to be united...

99
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:30,681
come what may,

100
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:39,224
they will come together in
a red circle, and stay there forever.

101
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:47,636
Hey!

102
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:50,130
What's your name?

103
00:08:58,772 --> 00:08:59,580
Name?

104
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:05,515
Tell me your name?

105
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:14,030
He hesitates...

106
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:15,589
because he stutters.

107
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:46,319
Chocolatey Chunnu!

108
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:49,557
He's an imp, a moppet,
a goat's furn/ poppet.

109
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:53,365
He's got tiny feet,
tiny tail and whiny bleat.

110
00:09:57,063 --> 00:09:58,599
Biscuita Bunnu!

111
00:10:00,467 --> 00:10:03,175
He's Chunnu's paPPV,
he's tall n strappy.

112
00:10:03,236 --> 00:10:07,309
With button-y eyes
and a moustache that's quite sappy.

113
00:10:11,578 --> 00:10:13,319
Chocolatey Chunnu.

114
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:15,349
On a terrible Tuesday,

115
00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:20,228
got into a bungle, lost in a jungle,
trapped in the wild, oh lonely!

116
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,362
Biscuita Bunnu.

117
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:26,298
Dans to the jungle,
unjumbles the bungle,

118
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:30,502
fights the wolves all alone, only!

119
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:33,676
Babu.

120
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:36,213
I had a friend.

121
00:10:36,503 --> 00:10:39,177
He'd stutter no end.
Can't talk, he would pretend.

122
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:41,143
People felt that he was so cute,

123
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:43,485
but thought he was mute.

124
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,522
And then one day, he staﬂed talking,

125
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,787
rat-a-tat, non-stop, no pause.

126
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:51,791
Ask me how?

127
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,463
Our brain...

128
00:10:55,522 --> 00:10:58,560
it... is...

129
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,229
like a walnut.

130
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:02,771
It has two pans.

131
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:04,737
Left... Right.

132
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:08,476
For example, when I'm talking,

133
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:10,612
I'm using the left side.

134
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:14,610
Left is for logic, left is systematic.

135
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:17,381
And the song that I was singing?

136
00:11:18,378 --> 00:11:20,016
That was from the right side.

137
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:23,688
This right side of ours,

138
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,159
is... is a little nutty,

139
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:27,760
is creative.

140
00:11:28,588 --> 00:11:30,067
So, then what did Babu do?

141
00:11:30,323 --> 00:11:32,325
He quit talking from the left.

142
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:35,563
Staﬂed talking from the right.

143
00:11:35,595 --> 00:11:36,665
In songs.

144
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:40,235
And never ever stuttered again.

145
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,142
Really!

146
00:11:42,135 --> 00:11:44,445
Now, I'll ask you a question.

147
00:11:44,504 --> 00:11:45,642
And you...

148
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:49,049
sing and answer.

149
00:11:49,142 --> 00:11:49,779
Okay?

150
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,350
And then you'll see...

151
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:54,224
magic!

152
00:11:57,817 --> 00:12:00,263
C'mon, tell me what's your name?

153
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,394
Don't fear...

154
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,126
you sing and answer.

155
00:12:06,593 --> 00:12:08,630
C'mon, tell me what's your name?

156
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:14,667
My name is... Jagga.

157
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:20,514
Now ask me, what's my name?

158
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:23,276
Wha... what?

159
00:12:23,443 --> 00:12:26,014
Totally broken bones.
Fully fractured fate.

160
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,559
You can call me Tutifuti.

161
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:30,351
What will you call me?

162
00:12:31,284 --> 00:12:32,763
Tutifuti.

163
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:37,362
Chocolatey Chunnu!

164
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:40,097
Chunnu is a little lamb
tiny teeny-weeny.

165
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:42,469
Chocolatey brown,
chocolatey brown.

166
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:44,131
Biscuita Bunnu

167
00:12:44,197 --> 00:12:45,403
he is teensy weensy.

168
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:48,173
Chunnu'5 PaPPV,
tall and strappy.

169
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:52,205
Eyes round and button-y
and a moustache that's quite sappy.

170
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:59,740
Odd n mismatched, O what a pair.

171
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:08,251
One sang his mind with not a care.

172
00:14:16,122 --> 00:14:21,663
And the other whose luck
was rather unfair.

173
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:40,456
In a world that's jinxed,
it's often said

174
00:14:40,513 --> 00:14:42,390
when your road looks smooth,
no rubble,

175
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:44,417
at the crossroad of life,

176
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:46,760
all decked up and nice,

177
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:48,760
eagerly awaits Ms. Trouble.

178
00:14:49,022 --> 00:14:51,195
We need more job opponunities
for the youth.

179
00:14:51,491 --> 00:14:53,198
So many of us do not have access to
even basic education and healthcare.

180
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:54,670
The state must take
care of its citizens.

181
00:14:55,528 --> 00:14:57,439
Our mothers and sisters
need to feel safe on the streets.

182
00:14:57,497 --> 00:14:58,271
Give way, please.

183
00:14:58,331 --> 00:15:00,140
We have gathered here to peacefully
ask the state for our demands.

184
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:01,701
Excuse us.

185
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,146
Give way, please.

186
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:05,576
Who's this guy?

187
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:29,304
Oh, no!

188
00:16:02,028 --> 00:16:03,564
Break it open.
- Yes sir.

189
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:08,141
Don't let him get away.

190
00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:20,986
Hey, stop! Reverse the car.

191
00:17:27,647 --> 00:17:29,149
<i>UV.-- UV.-- UV.--</i>

192
00:17:31,017 --> 00:17:35,488
When will you come back for me?

193
00:17:36,656 --> 00:17:39,466
I'll be back
in 6 months, 7 days and 8 hours.

194
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,333
Lies.

195
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:43,539
Just lies.

196
00:17:44,597 --> 00:17:49,569
The big toe rides your small toe

197
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:55,176
each time that you... lie.

198
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:58,580
Lies.

199
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:01,388
Just lies.

200
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,259
Brat!

201
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:30,681
Tutifuti left, just as he came.
All of a sudden.

202
00:18:30,743 --> 00:18:36,056
And Jagga was left with many
questions - What, who, where and why?

203
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:39,460
The answers, his curious mind
set out to find. What an obsession!

204
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:44,331
To find the answer to even] mysten/
and even] question!

205
00:18:59,071 --> 00:18:59,776
The best gunman by far,

206
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:01,040
no fancy car.

207
00:19:01,107 --> 00:19:03,553
Neither an overcoat norjudo.

208
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:06,112
Nabbing thieves is child's play.

209
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:08,317
A Ia snakes n ladders or Iudo.

210
00:19:08,381 --> 00:19:13,330
Stiff hair as an
antenna helps him spy.

211
00:19:13,386 --> 00:19:15,593
Sharper than binocs and x-ray,

212
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:17,464
his eyes that magnify.

213
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:19,264
Mastermind

214
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:22,238
of a caﬂoony kind.

215
00:19:22,295 --> 00:19:27,005
With a thousand childish quirks.

216
00:19:27,066 --> 00:19:28,636
Has a naughty smile,

217
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:31,274
and a weirdo style.

218
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,177
Eccentric,

219
00:19:33,239 --> 00:19:35,742
with a brain that works.

220
00:19:45,151 --> 00:19:47,222
Ukhru
's heanbeat:

221
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:49,425
He is Jagga Jasoos.

222
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:51,525
Cheats, crooks, pretty thieves,

223
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,661
he blows them out like fuse.

224
00:19:53,726 --> 00:19:56,297
The password to Jagga's world

225
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:58,467
is safe with me.

226
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:00,511
‘Cause in his many sagas

227
00:20:00,566 --> 00:20:02,443
is my special ston].

228
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:04,071
Mastermind

229
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:06,582
of a caﬂoony kind.

230
00:20:07,006 --> 00:20:08,246
Eccentric,

231
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:11,049
with a brain that works.

232
00:22:02,755 --> 00:22:05,668
Can someone tell me
what the time is?

233
00:22:07,393 --> 00:22:09,669
Left turn!

234
00:22:40,426 --> 00:22:45,068
This con-job involves three layers.

235
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:49,601
Love triangle with three players.

236
00:22:49,668 --> 00:22:53,673
Mr. Bhaduri and Ms. Mala.

237
00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:59,485
Ms. Mala... Ms. Mala... Ms. Mala.

238
00:23:03,182 --> 00:23:06,288
Mrs. Bhaduri, she teaches histonj.

239
00:23:06,352 --> 00:23:09,196
her husband is her soft spot.

240
00:23:11,457 --> 00:23:14,165
Ms. Mala, ven/ stylish.

241
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:15,398
Teaches English.

242
00:23:15,461 --> 00:23:18,772
Amongst the boys she's quite sought!

243
00:23:19,365 --> 00:23:20,309
Mr. Bhaduri.

244
00:23:20,366 --> 00:23:21,743
Attention!
- PT teacher.

245
00:23:22,001 --> 00:23:25,608
Steady body, wayward heart

246
00:23:26,305 --> 00:23:28,615
June was about to start

247
00:23:28,674 --> 00:23:30,517
Thunder! Lightening!

248
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:32,021
Pitter patter showers.

249
00:23:33,112 --> 00:23:37,288
Ms. Ma
a's body was found
below the clock tower.

250
00:23:46,192 --> 00:23:49,799
It is clear.
Definitely suicide.

251
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:42,786
Ms. Mala Moitra was not only loved
by the students and faculty alike,

252
00:24:43,048 --> 00:24:46,086
but also an inspiration to all.

253
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:49,765
She was the head and soul ofthe
English depanment and Culture Club.

254
00:24:50,022 --> 00:24:53,560
N... N...N... not suicide.
It is murder.

255
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:58,335
Jagga said it is a murder.

256
00:24:59,298 --> 00:25:02,643
It is murder.

257
00:25:33,332 --> 00:25:35,437
- Even/one says it is suicide.
You say it is a murder!

258
00:25:35,501 --> 00:25:36,502
How is it a murder?

259
00:25:36,568 --> 00:25:39,048
Early morning Ms. Mala went out
for milk to buy.

260
00:25:39,104 --> 00:25:41,311
Oh! Must commit suicide, she thought.

261
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,649
Then, she jumped off the tower,
good bye!

262
00:25:44,276 --> 00:25:45,448
It's true.

263
00:25:45,511 --> 00:25:46,353
You have a point.

264
00:25:46,412 --> 00:25:49,052
She who soaks beans in the night,

265
00:25:49,114 --> 00:25:51,458
come morning why would
she commit suicide?

266
00:25:51,517 --> 00:25:53,793
Dimwit. It's suicide.

267
00:25:54,153 --> 00:25:55,689
It could be a last minute plan.

268
00:25:55,754 --> 00:25:56,494
Get me a cola.

269
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:57,625
Could be an early morning thought,

270
00:25:57,689 --> 00:25:59,225
mind must be in a knot.

271
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:01,134
"With life I cannot cope,
death's my only hope."

272
00:26:01,193 --> 00:26:03,264
It's m... mu... murder.

273
00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:04,238
It is murder!

274
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:05,707
Shall I pop it?
— Hup!

275
00:26:05,965 --> 00:26:08,070
According to Mr. Milkman

276
00:26:08,133 --> 00:26:10,443
the clock tower was
their secret hideout.

277
00:26:10,502 --> 00:26:13,142
Buying milk was only a way to get out.

278
00:26:13,205 --> 00:26:14,240
Actually they...

279
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:16,047
Wanted to drink the milk
and keep the cream.

280
00:26:16,108 --> 00:26:17,280
This, even/one knows!

281
00:26:17,342 --> 00:26:18,082
Do they?

282
00:26:18,143 --> 00:26:19,713
We do.

283
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:21,519
Tell me something new.

284
00:26:21,613 --> 00:26:22,683
Should I?
- Shall I pop it?

285
00:26:22,981 --> 00:26:24,016
Shhh!

286
00:26:24,383 --> 00:26:26,624
Inside the tower entered three.

287
00:26:26,652 --> 00:26:28,996
6:15 exits the wife. No one but she.

288
00:26:29,355 --> 00:26:31,460
6:30, Ms. Mala.
6:45, the husband, carefree!

289
00:26:31,523 --> 00:26:34,470
But, at 7, out come only two.

290
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:35,697
So?

291
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:36,671
So... arrest them.

292
00:26:36,729 --> 00:26:39,266
My foot! Arrest them?

293
00:26:39,365 --> 00:26:41,709
When Ms. Mala jumped from the tower

294
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:44,441
where was Mrs. Bhaduri
and her husband dear?

295
00:26:44,503 --> 00:26:45,481
Where?

296
00:26:45,671 --> 00:26:47,014
In school.

297
00:26:47,373 --> 00:26:48,784
Even/one knows it.

298
00:26:49,008 --> 00:26:49,383
You know?

299
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:51,682
We know... we know... we know.

300
00:26:52,044 --> 00:26:54,285
If it happened, it did, but how?

301
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:55,381
What did they do? And how?

302
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:56,517
How?

303
00:26:56,582 --> 00:26:58,721
If it happened, it did, but how?

304
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:00,058
What did they do? And how?

305
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:01,120
How?

306
00:27:01,186 --> 00:27:03,359
How was one man
in two places. How?

307
00:27:03,422 --> 00:27:05,561
How was one man
in two places. How?

308
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:06,500
How?

309
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:07,994
How?

310
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,266
How?

311
00:27:10,262 --> 00:27:12,503
If it happened, it did, but how?

312
00:27:12,531 --> 00:27:13,532
What did they do? And how?

313
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:14,669
How?

314
00:27:14,733 --> 00:27:17,111
If it happened, it did, but how?

315
00:27:17,169 --> 00:27:18,170
What did they do? And how?

316
00:27:18,237 --> 00:27:19,272
How?

317
00:27:19,338 --> 00:27:23,980
How was one man
in two places. How?

318
00:27:24,042 --> 00:27:24,486
How?

319
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:25,747
How?

320
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:27,985
O How?

321
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:33,151
The sticker in the cereal pack

322
00:27:33,218 --> 00:27:36,756
is right at the bottom, whack!

323
00:27:37,022 --> 00:27:41,164
This ten-day wait bores to death.

324
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:45,441
I have to eat the whole box
for just a sticker.

325
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:46,601
My little fool.

326
00:27:47,533 --> 00:27:50,275
First turn the packet upside down.

327
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:51,609
Now, open it.

328
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:54,310
The sticker at the bottom
will now be on top.

329
00:27:57,709 --> 00:28:01,714
So, what is the moral ofthe stow?

330
00:28:02,281 --> 00:28:06,388
When you can't figure
something straight,

331
00:28:06,451 --> 00:28:09,364
turn it on its head and look.

332
00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:13,164
When you can't figure
something straight,

333
00:28:13,225 --> 00:28:15,967
turn it on its head and look.

334
00:29:24,062 --> 00:29:27,475
‘Twas bright and early in the morn

335
00:29:27,533 --> 00:29:30,742
Singi song dingi dong, lover's dawn

336
00:29:31,003 --> 00:29:34,314
Mr. Bhaduri and Ms. Mala.

337
00:29:34,373 --> 00:29:37,752
Ms. Mala... Ms. Mala... Ms. Mala!

338
00:29:38,243 --> 00:29:41,747
One who met her even/day.

339
00:29:42,014 --> 00:29:45,257
The lovers’ secret he would betray.

340
00:29:45,317 --> 00:29:48,423
He sent their love ston/ astray.

341
00:29:48,487 --> 00:29:52,230
Mr. Milkman, and his foul play.

342
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:54,202
Quietly, without uttering word,

343
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:55,738
he flew to the lady like a bird.

344
00:29:55,994 --> 00:29:56,665
He bluned it all,

345
00:29:56,728 --> 00:29:57,604
secrets, big and small.

346
00:29:57,663 --> 00:29:59,574
Gave a sample of a snitch.

347
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:04,637
Keeping quiet without a twitch.

348
00:30:04,703 --> 00:30:06,478
Then, went for the big six.

349
00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:10,350
Yes... your husband has some
extra marital tricks.

350
00:30:10,409 --> 00:30:12,218
He's a fraud, oh he's a quack.

351
00:30:12,277 --> 00:30:13,585
He has stabbed you in your back.

352
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:14,521
The ship sank.

353
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:15,489
Even/thing is blank.

354
00:30:15,547 --> 00:30:17,185
Take this, with thanks.

355
00:30:20,786 --> 00:30:24,757
Bouncy stride and head aflutter,
Ms. Ma
a's off for coochie coo.

356
00:30:25,023 --> 00:30:29,130
Gritsy gutsy appears madam
with her Kung Fu.

357
00:30:29,194 --> 00:30:31,640
Shameless, spineless twit!

358
00:30:31,697 --> 00:30:33,768
That's not me,
it's you, you twit!

359
00:30:34,032 --> 00:30:35,568
WhV mV hubby, my man?

360
00:30:35,634 --> 00:30:37,671
Control love, who can?

361
00:30:38,437 --> 00:30:45,286
Cambodia, Colombia, Estonia, Algeria,

362
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:50,344
Kulumeria,
Veldoria, Kandetoh, Haribol!

363
00:31:12,504 --> 00:31:17,476
That's how this ston/ goes tra Ia Ia!

364
00:31:18,176 --> 00:31:23,319
Gon/ and dark,
what cou
d've been gala.

365
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:28,597
Lost in love and lost her life.

366
00:31:28,654 --> 00:31:34,127
Ms. Mala... Ms. Mala... Ms. Mala!

367
00:31:41,266 --> 00:31:45,544
Jagga, but we all saw Ms. Mala jump
from the clock tower.

368
00:31:46,505 --> 00:31:48,280
The dead body fell with a loud crash!

369
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:50,115
All were stunned with the smash.

370
00:31:50,175 --> 00:31:52,815
What happened in that fatal one hour?

371
00:31:53,078 --> 00:31:54,580
The secret is safe in the clock tower.

372
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:55,590
Tick tock.

373
00:31:55,647 --> 00:31:59,288
Tick tock... tick tock

374
00:31:59,351 --> 00:32:01,058
The body lay in front of our eyes.

375
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:02,724
Mrs. Bhaduri stood by with her lies.

376
00:32:02,988 --> 00:32:05,730
Her hands were stained
with Ma
a's blood.

377
00:32:05,991 --> 00:32:06,696
Blood.

378
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:09,568
Not like that...
from the epiglottis... Blood.

379
00:32:09,628 --> 00:32:11,232
Blood!

380
00:32:11,563 --> 00:32:12,303
Blood!

381
00:32:12,364 --> 00:32:14,173
Tick Tock...
- Blood!

382
00:32:14,232 --> 00:32:16,075
Tick tock...
- Blood.

383
00:32:16,134 --> 00:32:19,604
Such moments leave you
at loss for words.

384
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:23,346
But, our Mr.
Bhaduri was a sman sly bird.

385
00:32:23,408 --> 00:32:25,410
His wedding vows were now at stake.

386
00:32:25,477 --> 00:32:27,184
Scratched his head for clarity sake

387
00:32:27,245 --> 00:32:28,781
and thought, what to do?

388
00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:30,754
Tick tock... what to do?

389
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:40,062
He ran, distraught.
From Humpu's garden a rope he got,

390
00:32:40,091 --> 00:32:43,231
and tied the corpse against the clock

391
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:44,535
with a Magic knot.

392
00:32:44,596 --> 00:32:46,371
What?
- Magic knot!

393
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:49,406
Magic knot?

394
00:32:49,768 --> 00:32:52,248
Basically, this knot is used
for mountain climbing

395
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:54,250
and to tie horses.

396
00:32:54,473 --> 00:32:59,047
If you loop the rope once

397
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:02,057
and pull a second loop from under
the first one and pull tight.

398
00:33:02,113 --> 00:33:03,717
Basically, though this is ven/ tight

399
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:07,725
it takes just a tug at the other end
to undo the knot.

400
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:14,227
Bid adieu to the corpse,
and set the deathly tick tock.

401
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:15,270
By the hands ofthe clock.

402
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:16,567
Hands of the clock.

403
00:33:17,229 --> 00:33:18,139
Hands of the clock.

404
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:19,733
Tick tock... Hands ofthe clock.

405
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,602
Tick tock... Hands ofthe clock.

406
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:23,475
Tick tock... Hands ofthe clock.

407
00:33:23,535 --> 00:33:25,446
What to do... Hands ofthe clock.

408
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:27,313
What to do... Hands ofthe clock.

409
00:33:27,372 --> 00:33:29,181
What to do... Hands ofthe clock.

410
00:34:15,754 --> 00:34:20,169
Behind his smiling face, was hidden,

411
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:22,364
a lonesome, lonely Jagga.

412
00:34:23,128 --> 00:34:26,371
Come summer, other kids would go away.

413
00:34:26,431 --> 00:34:30,641
Empty chairs,
tables and beds would stay.

414
00:34:30,702 --> 00:34:35,242
And... a lonesome, lonely Jagga.

415
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:10,746
There was a bridge connecting
Jagga's present and past.

416
00:35:11,009 --> 00:35:12,682
Made of video tapes.

417
00:35:12,711 --> 00:35:16,750
On even] biﬂhday, there would be
a new tape added to this bridge.

418
00:35:17,015 --> 00:35:20,986
One that Tutifuti would send
from some corner of the world.

419
00:35:22,087 --> 00:35:24,363
I do envy Jagga at times.

420
00:35:24,422 --> 00:35:29,394
Tutifuti had taught Jagga
the spirit of living,

421
00:35:31,162 --> 00:35:35,042
from miles away,
just through these video tapes.

422
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:38,445
which despite staying together
most parents fail at.

423
00:35:38,503 --> 00:35:43,612
This one tape would bring Jagga
his annual supply of oxygen.

424
00:35:52,684 --> 00:35:54,493
Happy binhday!

425
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,573
HaPPV biﬁhday, dear Jagga!

426
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:07,610
There are only two kinds
of people in this world.

427
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:09,236
Nails and hammers.

428
00:36:09,301 --> 00:36:10,143
Which do you want to be?

429
00:36:10,202 --> 00:36:11,044
You decide.

430
00:36:11,102 --> 00:36:12,046
This is a magazine.

431
00:36:12,103 --> 00:36:12,706
Safety lock.

432
00:36:12,971 --> 00:36:15,315
Off spin... leg spin.

433
00:36:15,373 --> 00:36:16,647
Worries and googlies,

434
00:36:16,708 --> 00:36:18,483
spot them early,
and you will hit a six.

435
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,751
Else, you'll be in a fix.

436
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:24,118
The human mind
and a parachute are alike.

437
00:36:24,316 --> 00:36:26,421
Ifthey are open, it's great
Else, you are dead.

438
00:36:26,484 --> 00:36:28,225
Stan from up.

439
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:29,230
The other way... wrong.

440
00:36:29,287 --> 00:36:30,425
Not the other way.

441
00:36:31,122 --> 00:36:32,692
E-Minor.

442
00:36:32,991 --> 00:36:34,129
Life's biggest disease today

443
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,500
is worn/ing about
what people will say?

444
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,164
Till the time a thief is not caught,

445
00:36:37,229 --> 00:36:38,401
he isn't a thief, he is an anist.

446
00:36:38,463 --> 00:36:39,407
If you want to punch,

447
00:36:39,464 --> 00:36:40,465
make a fist at the last minute,

448
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:41,442
it will double the
force at which it lands.

449
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,639
This year,
you will get no pocket money.

450
00:36:44,069 --> 00:36:45,480
Pay your school fees on your own.

451
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:47,141
It's simple.

452
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:49,378
Catch fish and sell it in the market.

453
00:36:49,441 --> 00:36:51,284
Feluda, Sherlock, Ray,
Ghatak, Hitchcock.

454
00:36:51,343 --> 00:36:53,050
Maradona, Sampras,
Sir Don Bradman,

455
00:36:53,111 --> 00:36:54,647
Louis Armstrong, Elvis, Jackson.

456
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:56,021
Hitler, Chenghis, Scarlett.

457
00:36:56,081 --> 00:36:57,389
Modern Times by Chaplin.

458
00:36:57,449 --> 00:37:00,055
Happy birthday to you.

459
00:37:08,426 --> 00:37:09,598
You...

460
00:37:10,695 --> 00:37:11,730
8T6...

461
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:17,137
here... somewhere.

462
00:37:18,269 --> 00:37:22,115
Or then...

463
00:37:23,108 --> 00:37:27,022
you are nowhere.

464
00:37:27,412 --> 00:37:30,018
Yet again.

465
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:32,391
Yet again.

466
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:35,021
Dreams with broken wings,

467
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:37,259
Vet again.

468
00:37:37,355 --> 00:37:39,596
Yet again.

469
00:37:39,991 --> 00:37:42,028
Yet again.

470
00:37:42,293 --> 00:37:44,671
Upset unfulfilled yearnings,

471
00:37:44,729 --> 00:37:46,731
Vet again.

472
00:37:47,298 --> 00:37:49,175
Yet again.

473
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:52,415
Yet again.

474
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:57,220
The cloud of doom.

475
00:37:57,275 --> 00:38:02,623
Why is my head,

476
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:07,060
so filled with gloom?

477
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:11,692
First you bond then break my heart

478
00:38:12,056 --> 00:38:16,698
Why did you come, if you had to pan?

479
00:38:16,962 --> 00:38:21,172
With some excuse as you depaﬂ,

480
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:25,203
Vet again.

481
00:38:26,171 --> 00:38:31,621
Yet again.

482
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,547
Photographs.

483
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,363
Their death ceﬂificates.

484
00:39:17,422 --> 00:39:18,526
VHS tape?

485
00:39:20,658 --> 00:39:22,535
You are a free man, Bagchi.

486
00:39:23,461 --> 00:39:24,633
Go back to life.

487
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:26,504
So long, sir.

488
00:39:44,015 --> 00:39:45,358
Green light.

489
00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:46,688
Tutifuti and Jagga were miles apart

490
00:40:47,078 --> 00:40:50,059
Will his last tape ever reach Jagga?

491
00:40:50,248 --> 00:40:52,660
The answer can be found in here.

492
00:40:53,251 --> 00:40:55,595
What happened to Tutifuti?
- Is he dead?

493
00:40:57,522 --> 00:40:58,592
Your answer is in this book.

494
00:40:58,656 --> 00:41:01,694
But to get to this one,
we must first read this book.

495
00:41:01,759 --> 00:41:03,397
The second book ofthe series...

496
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:07,034
Jagga Jasoos and the
Murder on the Giant Wheel.

497
00:41:07,098 --> 00:41:10,136
Look, look, so beautiful,
look, look, so mesmerizing.

498
00:41:10,201 --> 00:41:14,274
These lands are so green,
this town is like a jewel.

499
00:41:14,339 --> 00:41:17,479
By the way, we too are characters
from a comic book.

500
00:41:17,542 --> 00:41:19,249
And ‘He’ is the writer.

501
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:21,790
The one with the office
behind the clouds.

502
00:41:22,046 --> 00:41:25,619
Sometimes, for two estranged
characters to meet,

503
00:41:25,683 --> 00:41:29,130
He creates a third twist in the plot,

504
00:41:29,154 --> 00:41:31,259
that no one can predict.

505
00:41:31,289 --> 00:41:34,793
From the Shirui mountains
to Loktak lake,

506
00:41:35,026 --> 00:41:37,768
our motherland is so beautiful.

507
00:41:38,029 --> 00:41:40,771
This case isn't one of Jagga's best.

508
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:43,270
But, it is my favourite.

509
00:41:46,137 --> 00:41:47,172
And...

510
00:41:47,238 --> 00:41:48,615
for ven/ good reason.

511
00:41:48,673 --> 00:41:52,644
Look, look, so beautiful,
look, look, so mesmerizing.

512
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:57,056
These lands are so green,
this town is like a jewel.

513
00:41:57,115 --> 00:42:01,063
Look, look, so beautiful,
look, look, so mesmerizing.

514
00:42:01,085 --> 00:42:05,295
These lands are so green,
this town is like a jewel.

515
00:43:10,688 --> 00:43:12,668
Whose bags are these?

516
00:44:48,386 --> 00:44:49,421
Take the bullet out.

517
00:44:49,487 --> 00:44:53,526
Take the bullet out... fast!

518
00:45:28,593 --> 00:45:29,537
Hello!

519
00:46:03,361 --> 00:46:05,967
Is the ambulance here?
- Not yet, sir.

520
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:07,509
Look under that.

521
00:46:07,565 --> 00:46:08,509
Hey!

522
00:46:10,001 --> 00:46:12,277
Why are you touching it?

523
00:46:12,336 --> 00:46:14,441
Look up there.
- Okay, sir.

524
00:46:14,505 --> 00:46:17,145
Did you check thoroughly?
Found anything?

525
00:46:17,642 --> 00:46:19,485
No, sir. Nothing.

526
00:47:18,503 --> 00:47:21,245
Ma'am, keep walking straight ahead.

527
00:47:21,305 --> 00:47:23,285
Do not turn to look back.

528
00:47:27,645 --> 00:47:29,625
The moment is right.

529
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,591
The lovers unite.

530
00:47:31,649 --> 00:47:33,629
There is a scandal.

531
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:35,630
One, you cannot handle.

532
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:37,597
There is a scandal.

533
00:47:37,655 --> 00:47:39,726
One, you cannot handle.

534
00:47:40,324 --> 00:47:41,462
Can't we go somewhere else?

535
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:43,266
It would be safest on the giant wheel.

536
00:47:43,327 --> 00:47:45,500
Their people are all around.

537
00:47:47,398 --> 00:47:49,503
I feel giddy in these rides.

538
00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:54,149
Hey! Are you crazy?

539
00:47:54,205 --> 00:47:55,741
What are you doing?

540
00:48:00,745 --> 00:48:02,588
What is the information?

541
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:36,490
There is a scandal.

542
00:48:36,547 --> 00:48:38,458
One, you cannot handle.

543
00:48:38,516 --> 00:48:40,462
There is a scandal.

544
00:48:40,518 --> 00:48:42,020
One, you cannot handle.

545
00:48:42,086 --> 00:48:43,588
There is a scandal.

546
00:48:43,654 --> 00:48:45,998
One, you cannot handle.

547
00:49:43,681 --> 00:49:45,718
Move aside. Move!

548
00:50:42,339 --> 00:50:44,717
S... S... S...

549
00:51:05,996 --> 00:51:09,000
Some flowers, to bloom
take a little time.

550
00:51:09,033 --> 00:51:12,742
My words, too, sleepily fall in line.

551
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:19,186
Which is why I sing it out,
you know, so it comes out smooth.

552
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:24,250
Without consent,
entered your den.

553
00:51:24,315 --> 00:51:25,794
I agree it's a mistake.

554
00:51:26,050 --> 00:51:29,122
I did it for good intentions’ sake.

555
00:51:29,186 --> 00:51:32,167
Need to find out
what is behind this mystenj.

556
00:51:32,189 --> 00:51:35,193
What is your role in this?
What is your histonj?

557
00:51:35,259 --> 00:51:38,331
The commotion in Ukhrul
that you have created

558
00:51:38,396 --> 00:51:41,775
the solution for which
is sincerely awaited.

559
00:51:42,466 --> 00:51:44,707
Hello! Help! Manager!

560
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:46,270
Not anyone else,

561
00:51:46,337 --> 00:51:47,611
only I can help you out.

562
00:51:47,671 --> 00:51:51,448
Just spill the beans
to clear my doubts.

563
00:51:51,508 --> 00:51:52,612
Manager!

564
00:51:52,676 --> 00:51:53,654
Anyone there?

565
00:51:53,711 --> 00:51:56,715
He who is dead, who was he?

566
00:51:56,781 --> 00:51:59,762
What's the scam that he had done?

567
00:51:59,817 --> 00:52:03,355
Was what he did that killed him,
the same one?

568
00:52:04,355 --> 00:52:05,561
How do you know all this?

569
00:52:05,623 --> 00:52:08,604
Did he have some scoop so grim?

570
00:52:08,626 --> 00:52:12,164
Something so deadly
that it actually killed him.

571
00:52:12,496 --> 00:52:14,032
Why should I tell you, tell me please?

572
00:52:14,098 --> 00:52:16,601
Instead I'll just call the police.

573
00:52:18,002 --> 00:52:18,776
What?

574
00:52:23,708 --> 00:52:24,448
What?

575
00:52:24,508 --> 00:52:26,181
The police are already on their way.

576
00:52:26,243 --> 00:52:27,517
What will you say?

577
00:52:27,578 --> 00:52:30,081
How will you save yourself today?

578
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:33,356
Let me tell you my love,
the body's been found.

579
00:52:33,417 --> 00:52:37,058
The murder weapon
has your finger prints abound.

580
00:52:43,694 --> 00:52:45,332
Can I h... he
...?

581
00:52:45,729 --> 00:52:46,799
What's your name?

582
00:52:47,131 --> 00:52:50,112
J... J... J...

583
00:52:50,401 --> 00:52:51,641
Got it.

584
00:52:52,569 --> 00:52:55,209
No, listen. Can I h...?

585
00:52:55,272 --> 00:52:56,546
No, thank you.

586
00:52:57,174 --> 00:52:59,620
I can take care of myself.

587
00:53:23,133 --> 00:53:25,079
Ms. Shruti...

588
00:53:27,138 --> 00:53:30,119
I know you, Ms. Sh... Sh...

589
00:53:34,645 --> 00:53:37,524
The hotel register
has your name as Sangeeta.

590
00:53:37,548 --> 00:53:40,757
But, your real name is Shruti.
Isn't it, Ms. Shruti Sengupta?

591
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:44,724
Age: 26.

592
00:53:45,256 --> 00:53:45,529
25.

593
00:53:45,589 --> 00:53:47,262
Oops. Sorn].

594
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:51,665
Schooled in London,
your accent gives you away.

595
00:53:51,728 --> 00:53:53,708
"Help... Police!"

596
00:53:54,465 --> 00:53:56,274
This accent is western, I say.

597
00:53:56,467 --> 00:53:59,471
From Calcutta, a journalist you are.

598
00:53:59,536 --> 00:54:02,449
Illegal arms form your stow, so far.

599
00:54:04,975 --> 00:54:06,477
Actually, it's not your fault,

600
00:54:06,543 --> 00:54:08,284
I'll blame it on your bad luck

601
00:54:08,312 --> 00:54:11,623
that's just not leaving you,
it's badly stuck.

602
00:54:12,282 --> 00:54:15,491
Even on the bridge,
you're followed by ill luck.

603
00:54:15,552 --> 00:54:17,156
In four steps... watch outl!

604
00:54:17,221 --> 00:54:18,564
Your foot will get stuck.

605
00:54:18,622 --> 00:54:20,499
1,2,3.

606
00:54:21,658 --> 00:54:23,069
Stuck.

607
00:54:30,534 --> 00:54:31,535
Help.

608
00:54:40,177 --> 00:54:41,451
Where should I staﬂ?

609
00:54:41,512 --> 00:54:43,150
F... F... From the beginning.

610
00:54:54,591 --> 00:54:55,433
Hello.

611
00:54:55,492 --> 00:54:57,335
Ma'am, I can't speak right now.

612
00:54:57,394 --> 00:55:00,204
Let's meet in the evening.
I'll see you at the fair at 5.

613
00:55:17,548 --> 00:55:21,496
Poor Tumba, an ex-millitant,
he just wanted to save his brother.

614
00:55:21,552 --> 00:55:23,429
He had to get the bullet taken out.

615
00:55:23,487 --> 00:55:27,060
Those who killed him
were a dangerous and lethal lot.

616
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:30,570
The local youth would be brainwashed
and trained to become militants.

617
00:55:30,594 --> 00:55:36,340
In the last phase oftheir training regime,
new recruits are tricked to trade in arms.

618
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:42,107
Ifthey escape the army, they would be
killed the moment the job is done.

619
00:55:42,473 --> 00:55:44,783
Tumba and his brother,
escaped such an encounter,

620
00:55:45,042 --> 00:55:47,318
and became my informers.

621
00:55:47,678 --> 00:55:51,683
They wanted to blow the covers off
this cross border arms movement.

622
00:55:51,748 --> 00:55:55,218
But they could not hide for long.

623
00:55:55,285 --> 00:55:57,287
I was charged with murder.

624
00:55:57,354 --> 00:56:00,198
And with them, the information on this
secret route was silenced forever.

625
00:56:10,968 --> 00:56:12,208
What does this mean?

626
00:56:12,269 --> 00:56:14,306
I'm here with you because I want to.

627
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:15,281
What are you doing?

628
00:56:15,339 --> 00:56:18,479
According to the police,
you... a... a...

629
00:56:20,177 --> 00:56:21,121
are a murderer.

630
00:56:21,478 --> 00:56:23,480
Thanks... for reminding me.

631
00:56:34,425 --> 00:56:36,200
Hello. Hey!

632
00:56:37,194 --> 00:56:39,003
Hey, Jagga!

633
00:57:46,697 --> 00:57:47,767
Found her?
- Not yet.

634
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:49,237
ls she still here or left?

635
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:50,607
Hasn't left Ukhrul, for sure.

636
00:57:50,668 --> 00:57:52,272
She better not have.

637
00:57:52,336 --> 00:57:55,180
The girl,
her source, her investigation,

638
00:57:55,239 --> 00:57:56,149
put an end to it all.

639
00:57:56,206 --> 00:57:57,378
Okay.
- Let's go.

640
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:34,216
Just a minute.

641
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:44,624
A girl in our hostel?

642
00:58:44,688 --> 00:58:46,634
How did she get in?

643
00:59:25,495 --> 00:59:26,337
Hello.

644
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:31,108
Halt!

645
00:59:50,621 --> 00:59:54,364
I'm from Jhumri Talaiya.

646
00:59:56,159 --> 00:59:59,265
You are maybe from Timbuktu.

647
01:00:01,465 --> 01:00:04,742
If we're meant to, we'll surely meet.

648
01:00:07,037 --> 01:00:10,644
Even if after that, I never see you.

649
01:00:12,309 --> 01:00:16,689
It's fate that made us two collide.

650
01:00:17,681 --> 01:00:19,718
Our stories will surely coincide.
- F... F... Fire.

651
01:00:19,783 --> 01:00:21,785
Fire!
- F... F... F...

652
01:00:22,052 --> 01:00:24,464
Fire!
F... F... fire!

653
01:00:24,521 --> 01:00:26,228
Fire brigade.

654
01:00:28,025 --> 01:00:31,438
The world,
it suddenly seems more bright.

655
01:00:31,495 --> 01:00:34,135
Out to please me with delight.

656
01:00:34,197 --> 01:00:38,202
Tends to my whims, real polite.

657
01:00:38,568 --> 01:00:42,277
The world,
it suddenly seems more bright.

658
01:00:42,339 --> 01:00:44,819
Out to please me with delight.

659
01:00:45,075 --> 01:00:49,353
Tends to my whims, real polite.

660
01:00:53,316 --> 01:00:54,761
Are you angnj?

661
01:00:56,119 --> 01:00:57,257
Are you angnj?

662
01:00:58,188 --> 01:00:59,189
Are you angnj?

663
01:00:59,523 --> 01:01:01,525
She asks me if I'm angn/l

664
01:01:03,060 --> 01:01:05,597
Feluda got burnt, so did Sherlock.

665
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:08,165
Hostel said, "No entnj",

666
01:01:08,231 --> 01:01:11,110
will be sealed with a lock.

667
01:01:11,168 --> 01:01:14,047
My stubble from my ven/ first shave.

668
01:01:14,104 --> 01:01:16,311
My binocs from Nainital,
I couldn't save.

669
01:01:16,373 --> 01:01:18,319
My mouth organ,

670
01:01:18,375 --> 01:01:20,377
my little lamp,

671
01:01:20,444 --> 01:01:21,752
my tea kettle,

672
01:01:22,012 --> 01:01:24,151
my canvas cap,

673
01:01:24,548 --> 01:01:27,324
my underpants, my towel

674
01:01:27,384 --> 01:01:30,126
my bed burnt to rubble.

675
01:01:30,187 --> 01:01:32,258
I'm doomed!

676
01:01:32,322 --> 01:01:36,065
And, you ask, ifl am angn].

677
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:39,772
I never wanted your help,

678
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:42,806
never once did I ask.

679
01:01:43,066 --> 01:01:48,072
How dare you think
you could take me to task?

680
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:50,783
Older than you, am I.

681
01:01:51,041 --> 01:01:54,079
A little respect, you may tn].

682
01:01:54,144 --> 01:01:57,148
It's my case, I can handle it.

683
01:01:57,180 --> 01:02:00,491
You go your way, ta-ta, goodbye.

684
01:02:00,517 --> 01:02:07,059
And now don't you dare
come following me!

685
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:10,060
Why am I singing?

686
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:13,739
My home is a burning desert

687
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:19,373
Yours, maybe in the Nor1h pole.

688
01:02:21,204 --> 01:02:24,617
But, if we do run into one another,

689
01:02:26,576 --> 01:02:30,046
the world will go out of control.

690
01:02:32,115 --> 01:02:36,029
I'll leave some songs for you to sing,

691
01:02:37,387 --> 01:02:41,267
some simple words to heal your soul.

692
01:02:41,291 --> 01:02:45,034
The world,
it suddenly seems more bright.

693
01:02:45,095 --> 01:02:47,541
Out to please me with delight.

694
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:51,101
Tends to my whims, real polite.

695
01:02:52,269 --> 01:02:56,046
The world,
it suddenly seems more bright.

696
01:02:56,106 --> 01:02:58,552
Out to please me with delight.

697
01:02:58,608 --> 01:03:02,488
Tends to my whims, real polite.

698
01:03:20,330 --> 01:03:26,611
Is there a brave one amongst you all?

699
01:03:28,405 --> 01:03:31,079
The brave one to face a knife

700
01:03:31,141 --> 01:03:33,314
Will Win 1000!

701
01:03:33,777 --> 01:03:38,055
Face two to get 3000,
and three to win 5000!

702
01:03:39,583 --> 01:03:41,790
The brave one in the yellow shin.

703
01:03:42,052 --> 01:03:44,328
Come up on stage.

704
01:03:44,387 --> 01:03:47,231
Give him a big round of applause.

705
01:03:47,290 --> 01:03:48,667
He's brave indeed!

706
01:05:28,024 --> 01:05:31,562
It is much bigger than I thought.
What will happen to me?

707
01:05:32,395 --> 01:05:34,102
The killer has escaped,

708
01:05:34,364 --> 01:05:36,002
now, the rest of my life in prison.

709
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:38,506
Question mark?

710
01:05:39,536 --> 01:05:44,076
Now that you have been a silly fool.

711
01:05:44,607 --> 01:05:48,555
Who else knows that you are in Ukhrul?

712
01:05:48,611 --> 01:05:50,386
Just my editor.

713
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:54,492
And A... A... Akash Vidyarlhi?

714
01:05:57,754 --> 01:05:59,256
Question mark?

715
01:05:59,322 --> 01:06:02,701
You and Akash are from
the same profession.

716
01:06:02,959 --> 01:06:06,065
Always writing in collaboration?

717
01:06:06,096 --> 01:06:09,339
So what happened this time?

718
01:06:09,699 --> 01:06:11,110
Ego?

719
01:06:11,301 --> 01:06:13,042
Or a job switch?

720
01:06:13,103 --> 01:06:16,141
Professional rivalnj?

721
01:06:16,206 --> 01:06:19,744
Or a personal glitch?

722
01:06:20,443 --> 01:06:21,444
Personal glitch?

723
01:06:21,511 --> 01:06:22,546
Nothing like that.

724
01:06:22,612 --> 01:06:26,492
After our engagement,
we decided not to work together.

725
01:06:26,683 --> 01:06:28,287
Engagement?

726
01:06:29,319 --> 01:06:31,060
Question mark...?

727
01:06:31,087 --> 01:06:34,398
Your world has gone haywire, askew.

728
01:06:34,457 --> 01:06:38,633
He's not bothered nor are you.

729
01:06:39,162 --> 01:06:39,765
Strange.

730
01:06:40,030 --> 01:06:43,477
Not even a call?

731
01:06:43,633 --> 01:06:47,137
He is with me,

732
01:06:47,170 --> 01:06:50,481
even when he is not.

733
01:06:50,507 --> 01:06:53,716
He understands it all.

734
01:06:53,776 --> 01:06:57,485
Whether spoken or not.

735
01:06:57,547 --> 01:07:03,554
This kind of love,
in books you read.

736
01:07:04,287 --> 01:07:11,136
I'm nothing without him,
he's my need.

737
01:07:19,235 --> 01:07:20,441
Understood?

738
01:07:27,277 --> 01:07:28,483
From the files you asked for...

739
01:07:28,544 --> 01:07:30,114
Here... December 2004...

740
01:07:30,180 --> 01:07:32,353
In the forest, 21 dead bodies found

741
01:07:32,415 --> 01:07:34,122
under mysterious circumstances.

742
01:07:34,551 --> 01:07:37,395
They were all young boys
between 16-25 years of age.

743
01:07:37,454 --> 01:07:40,128
This is from six month ago.

744
01:07:40,190 --> 01:07:41,635
15 bodies were found in Kamjong.

745
01:07:41,691 --> 01:07:43,728
Reason of death: Unknown.

746
01:07:46,296 --> 01:07:48,435
Here's the book on Netaji.

747
01:07:55,038 --> 01:07:56,540
Netaji?

748
01:07:57,040 --> 01:07:58,542
Papa... W... W... who's this?

749
01:07:58,608 --> 01:08:01,555
Netaji... Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose.

750
01:08:01,978 --> 01:08:04,185
Do you know why his statue is here?

751
01:08:04,247 --> 01:08:05,624
W...W...Why?

752
01:08:06,716 --> 01:08:08,627
In the year 1944,

753
01:08:08,685 --> 01:08:10,665
the war was on in full force.

754
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:14,566
The British were facing
Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose.

755
01:08:22,465 --> 01:08:26,436
Via Burma he planned
his army to attack.

756
01:08:26,503 --> 01:08:30,508
Hidden from the Brits
through a secret track.

757
01:08:30,573 --> 01:08:31,745
Which track?

758
01:08:32,542 --> 01:08:36,354
Under the hills, hidden behind trees,
was a small cave

759
01:08:36,413 --> 01:08:40,156
through which flowed a river.

760
01:08:40,216 --> 01:08:42,526
The cave passage is 20 kms long.

761
01:08:42,585 --> 01:08:46,158
On one end is Burma
and on the other is Ukhrul.

762
01:08:46,222 --> 01:08:50,170
Walking for three whole days
non-stop.

763
01:08:50,226 --> 01:08:52,035
Excess of calcium in even] drop,

764
01:08:52,095 --> 01:08:54,473
white feet, is what even/one got.

765
01:08:56,766 --> 01:08:58,643
After three days, they leave the cave

766
01:08:58,701 --> 01:09:00,647
on a track unsteady.

767
01:09:00,703 --> 01:09:02,546
They were in for a shock to see

768
01:09:02,605 --> 01:09:04,448
the Kayans waiting and ready.

769
01:09:05,642 --> 01:09:07,019
Kayan?

770
01:09:10,513 --> 01:09:12,356
Kayans are a tribe from this state.

771
01:09:12,415 --> 01:09:14,486
They have a unique trait.

772
01:09:14,517 --> 01:09:18,329
Away from the world
a hidden life they lead.

773
01:09:18,388 --> 01:09:21,733
The men ofthe hamlet,
elephants they breed.

774
01:09:21,991 --> 01:09:22,696
Makes sense.

775
01:09:22,959 --> 01:09:25,405
To smuggle out all the weapons
from this jungle,

776
01:09:25,461 --> 01:09:28,408
what better mode of transpon
than elephants?

777
01:09:28,464 --> 01:09:33,140
The route that Netaji used
is now used to smuggle weapons.

778
01:09:33,203 --> 01:09:35,513
We're late.

779
01:09:36,039 --> 01:09:40,454
The men are missing, elephants, too.

780
01:10:12,475 --> 01:10:14,284
Hum], that is enough!

781
01:10:14,344 --> 01:10:16,449
We are shod on time
and have along way to go.

782
01:10:16,513 --> 01:10:18,356
Let's go.

783
01:11:04,594 --> 01:11:07,097
There! Look, who is there?

784
01:11:11,334 --> 01:11:14,315
Be careful. And make it fast.

785
01:11:15,071 --> 01:11:16,709
Echo...

786
01:11:23,546 --> 01:11:28,495
Isn't she the girl
you've been searching for?

787
01:11:29,018 --> 01:11:31,259
Do I look like I've lost it?

788
01:11:32,188 --> 01:11:33,132
Echo...

789
01:11:35,125 --> 01:11:37,162
Shruti Sen...

790
01:11:42,198 --> 01:11:43,609
Shruti Sengupta?

791
01:11:43,666 --> 01:11:46,169
I read your anicles.
They are good!

792
01:11:46,536 --> 01:11:48,447
There was one more repoﬂer
with you, right?

793
01:11:48,504 --> 01:11:50,279
What was his name?

794
01:11:51,141 --> 01:11:52,211
Akash.

795
01:11:52,275 --> 01:11:53,345
Hey, Churko.

796
01:11:53,409 --> 01:11:54,217
Yes, sir.

797
01:11:54,277 --> 01:11:56,450
Killed him in Chhattisgarh.

798
01:11:56,479 --> 01:11:57,685
Yes.

799
01:11:58,081 --> 01:12:00,687
Didn't we kill him
in front of you at Billai?

800
01:12:01,517 --> 01:12:03,758
Still didn't get the warning?

801
01:12:04,587 --> 01:12:07,363
You've come here to die?

802
01:12:08,558 --> 01:12:09,559
Sad, huh?

803
01:12:10,994 --> 01:12:11,995
Why?

804
01:12:14,263 --> 01:12:15,264
Finish them off.

805
01:13:07,683 --> 01:13:09,219
Freeze!

806
01:13:09,285 --> 01:13:10,730
Don't move.

807
01:13:39,582 --> 01:13:43,359
(Bihu Folk Song)

808
01:14:09,145 --> 01:14:12,649
I can never get myself
to do anything right.

809
01:14:13,182 --> 01:14:15,253
If it weren't for you...

810
01:14:15,318 --> 01:14:16,558
C... C... Cool.

811
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:18,264

...

812
01:14:22,592 --> 01:14:24,037
P... Ph... Phone...

813
01:14:41,110 --> 01:14:42,180
And...

814
01:14:42,678 --> 01:14:43,748
Happy binhday!

815
01:14:44,614 --> 01:14:47,356
I do a bit of snooping, too.

816
01:14:48,718 --> 01:14:50,095
Jagga.

817
01:14:50,152 --> 01:14:52,792
If you need me,
I'm always there for you.

818
01:15:06,602 --> 01:15:10,641
I feel I felt a slight little shake,

819
01:15:10,706 --> 01:15:15,018
my life just stopped
with a sudden brake.

820
01:15:18,147 --> 01:15:21,993
Why my head, are you confused?

821
01:15:22,051 --> 01:15:24,998
My advice I think you should take.

822
01:15:25,021 --> 01:15:27,228
This is just the age,

823
01:15:27,290 --> 01:15:28,564
to err a mistake.

824
01:15:28,591 --> 01:15:31,037
This is just the age,

825
01:15:31,094 --> 01:15:32,300
to err a mistake.

826
01:15:32,361 --> 01:15:34,534
This is just the age,

827
01:15:34,597 --> 01:15:36,076
to err a mistake.

828
01:15:36,132 --> 01:15:38,305
This is just the age,

829
01:15:38,368 --> 01:15:39,642
to err a mistake.

830
01:15:39,702 --> 01:15:40,578
Dude!

831
01:15:55,051 --> 01:15:56,496
C'mon build your body.

832
01:15:56,552 --> 01:15:58,361
Pump your muscle.

833
01:15:58,421 --> 01:15:59,729
Your cheeks are too soft,

834
01:15:59,789 --> 01:16:01,598
grow a stubble.

835
01:16:01,657 --> 01:16:03,967
C'mon dude,

836
01:16:04,027 --> 01:16:07,474
get set.

837
01:16:07,530 --> 01:16:09,373
Give the deo some trouble.

838
01:16:09,432 --> 01:16:13,107
Make the girl next
door pop your bubble.

839
01:16:13,169 --> 01:16:16,412
Take off one button
or make it double.

840
01:16:16,472 --> 01:16:20,682
Bare your chest with
the overgrown stubble.

841
01:16:20,743 --> 01:16:24,350
You were pushing around a cycle,

842
01:16:24,413 --> 01:16:28,657
now pick a bike that you can find.

843
01:16:32,021 --> 01:16:35,468
Ifthe speed's getting you the chill,

844
01:16:35,525 --> 01:16:38,597
make a girl sit behind.

845
01:16:38,661 --> 01:16:41,107
This is just the age,

846
01:16:41,164 --> 01:16:42,700
to err a mistake.

847
01:16:42,765 --> 01:16:44,711
This is just the age,

848
01:16:44,767 --> 01:16:46,474
to err a mistake.

849
01:16:46,535 --> 01:16:48,412
This is just the age,

850
01:16:48,471 --> 01:16:50,144
to err a mistake.

851
01:16:50,206 --> 01:16:52,379
This is just the age,

852
01:16:52,441 --> 01:16:53,613
to err a mistake.

853
01:16:53,676 --> 01:16:55,155
Dude!

854
01:17:08,624 --> 01:17:10,626
This is just the age,

855
01:17:10,693 --> 01:17:12,331
to err a mistake.

856
01:17:12,395 --> 01:17:14,375
This is just the age,

857
01:17:14,430 --> 01:17:16,068
to err a mistake.

858
01:17:44,026 --> 01:17:46,336
Hi, Santa.

859
01:17:47,129 --> 01:17:49,336
Son, your courier is not here.

860
01:17:51,367 --> 01:17:53,040
It's okay, it happens.

861
01:17:59,709 --> 01:18:01,279
Happy biﬂhday.

862
01:18:19,662 --> 01:18:20,697
Sorn], sir.

863
01:18:21,130 --> 01:18:23,110
Sir, we've had no
one here in 10 years.

864
01:18:23,165 --> 01:18:24,735
I wonder where
these two have come from.

865
01:18:51,460 --> 01:18:54,441
You know what you are called
in our circuit, don't you?

866
01:18:54,497 --> 01:18:56,443
Blackmail Sinha.

867
01:18:58,134 --> 01:19:00,307
You were to get goods woﬂh millions.

868
01:19:00,369 --> 01:19:02,406
And all you've got is this scrap?

869
01:19:02,438 --> 01:19:03,382
Sinha!

870
01:19:03,406 --> 01:19:05,352
Sir, just hold on a second.

871
01:19:05,374 --> 01:19:07,320
This is just the appetizer.

872
01:19:07,376 --> 01:19:09,219
The main course is yet to come.

873
01:19:09,945 --> 01:19:13,051
And, by the way,
this main course,

874
01:19:13,115 --> 01:19:15,288
is nothing but your death ceﬂificate.

875
01:19:17,386 --> 01:19:20,526
Do you know what this is?

876
01:19:21,958 --> 01:19:27,567
This will expose you
and your Godfather, Bashir Alexander.

877
01:19:28,631 --> 01:19:30,110
If this tape goes public...

878
01:19:30,166 --> 01:19:33,375
Happy biﬂhday to you,

879
01:19:34,470 --> 01:19:37,610
Happy biﬂhday to you,

880
01:19:38,608 --> 01:19:40,315
Happy biﬂhday, dear Jagga...

881
01:19:40,343 --> 01:19:42,414
Just give me a second.

882
01:19:44,113 --> 01:19:46,992
Happy birthday to you.

883
01:19:47,049 --> 01:19:49,552
I really didn't get that joke, Sinha.

884
01:19:49,618 --> 01:19:51,461
Happy birthday to you.

885
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:52,999

...

886
01:19:53,356 --> 01:19:55,393
It's a... mistake.

887
01:19:56,492 --> 01:19:57,596
This isn't that tape.

888
01:19:57,660 --> 01:20:00,334
Actually,
I do have the tape with me. I...

889
01:20:01,397 --> 01:20:03,206
It's just that...

890
01:20:05,034 --> 01:20:08,174
Happy biﬂhday to you...

891
01:20:08,337 --> 01:20:10,476
Happy biﬂhday, Jagga.

892
01:20:24,386 --> 01:20:26,457
Nothing has come.

893
01:20:29,158 --> 01:20:31,229
No package for you, son.

894
01:20:31,293 --> 01:20:33,273
It would've been here, if it had to.

895
01:20:33,329 --> 01:20:35,673
If it does arrive,
I'll deliver it to the hostel.

896
01:20:49,111 --> 01:20:50,454
Jagga.

897
01:21:10,699 --> 01:21:13,441
H... H... H...

898
01:21:26,515 --> 01:21:28,324
He didn't even...

899
01:21:36,525 --> 01:21:40,632
tell me his name.

900
01:21:42,565 --> 01:21:46,672
Tu... Tuti...futi...

901
01:21:47,469 --> 01:21:49,506
B... Bagchi

902
01:21:50,272 --> 01:21:51,717
Badal Bagchi.

903
01:21:54,310 --> 01:21:56,756
Tutifuti Badal Bagchi.

904
01:22:25,174 --> 01:22:27,552
Sad, isn't it?
- Yes!

905
01:22:27,710 --> 01:22:30,054
Anyway, let's take a break?

906
01:22:30,112 --> 01:22:32,615
We'll continue with the third book
when we're back.

907
01:22:32,681 --> 01:22:33,489
Okay?
- Yes.

908
01:22:34,116 --> 01:22:35,322
We'll meet after 15 minutes.

909
01:22:35,384 --> 01:22:36,124
Okay?

910
01:22:36,185 --> 01:22:37,220
Bye.

911
01:23:09,218 --> 01:23:14,258
If it wasn't for Bagchi's bad luck
striking at the right time and place,

912
01:23:14,323 --> 01:23:18,533
no one would know about
the Puru
ia's arms drop case.

913
01:23:19,595 --> 01:23:22,235
Such cases occur daily
around the world.

914
01:23:22,297 --> 01:23:25,278
Yemen, Syria, Palestine, Libya...

915
01:23:28,670 --> 01:23:32,015
There is a common link
between all these arms drops.

916
01:23:32,074 --> 01:23:34,486
This emblem... this isn't a emblem.

917
01:23:35,310 --> 01:23:38,348
It's two people - Basheer, Alexander.

918
01:23:38,547 --> 01:23:40,493
No one has ever seen them.

919
01:23:40,549 --> 01:23:44,053
lnterpol's most wanted
illegal arms smuggler and supplier.

920
01:23:44,286 --> 01:23:47,699
And India is their biggest market.

921
01:23:48,090 --> 01:23:51,537
And why not, there are
so many militant groups.

922
01:23:52,227 --> 01:23:53,171
How many could there be?

923
01:23:54,430 --> 01:23:55,534
AnV guesses?

924
01:23:55,698 --> 01:23:56,642
10?

925
01:23:57,299 --> 01:23:58,300
300?

926
01:23:58,367 --> 01:23:59,141
400?

927
01:23:59,201 --> 01:24:01,044
About 500.

928
01:24:01,303 --> 01:24:04,147
Ever wonder,
people who are stan/ing away,

929
01:24:04,406 --> 01:24:07,546
where do they get these
expensive guns from?

930
01:24:07,743 --> 01:24:09,586
Someone must be behind this.

931
01:24:12,314 --> 01:24:17,662
This is what our
next book is all about.

932
01:24:20,022 --> 01:24:21,365
Bored, aren't you?

933
01:24:28,464 --> 01:24:30,239
Arms drop in Purulia.

934
01:24:30,299 --> 01:24:32,074
Why do we care?

935
01:24:32,134 --> 01:24:33,704
A bomb blows up
on the Patna Express.

936
01:24:33,769 --> 01:24:35,407
Why do we care?

937
01:24:35,470 --> 01:24:37,381
Our door has a lucky charm.

938
01:24:37,439 --> 01:24:39,214
We're safe from all harm.

939
01:24:39,275 --> 01:24:42,745
Why do we care?

940
01:24:43,011 --> 01:24:44,615
Factories swallow even] field.

941
01:24:44,680 --> 01:24:46,284
Why do we care?

942
01:24:46,348 --> 01:24:48,191
Farmers commit suicide, no yield.

943
01:24:48,250 --> 01:24:49,752
Why do we care?

944
01:24:50,018 --> 01:24:51,588
Our door has a lucky charm.

945
01:24:51,654 --> 01:24:53,531
We're safe from all harm.

946
01:24:53,589 --> 01:24:57,230
Why do we care?

947
01:24:57,292 --> 01:24:58,771
A hospital, the village has none.

948
01:24:59,027 --> 01:25:00,529
Why do we care?

949
01:25:00,596 --> 01:25:02,337
But a sale in the mall, what fun!

950
01:25:02,397 --> 01:25:04,240
We're set, you bet.

951
01:25:04,300 --> 01:25:06,143
Thanks to our lucky charm.

952
01:25:06,201 --> 01:25:07,612
We're safe from all harm.

953
01:25:07,670 --> 01:25:11,413
Why do we care?

954
01:25:11,473 --> 01:25:13,214
The nation is trivial,
only votes matter.

955
01:25:13,275 --> 01:25:14,652
Why do we care?

956
01:25:14,710 --> 01:25:16,417
Riots rampant,
people out to slaughter.

957
01:25:16,478 --> 01:25:18,185
Why do we care?

958
01:25:18,447 --> 01:25:20,256
Thanks to our lucky charm.

959
01:25:20,315 --> 01:25:22,090
Thanks to our lucky charm.

960
01:25:22,151 --> 01:25:24,028
Thanks to our lucky charm.

961
01:25:24,086 --> 01:25:25,565
We're safe from all harm.

962
01:25:31,193 --> 01:25:36,666
Happy birthday to you.

963
01:25:59,388 --> 01:26:00,560
What have you got?

964
01:26:19,241 --> 01:26:21,243
Their death ceﬂificates.

965
01:26:22,277 --> 01:26:23,756
VHS tape?

966
01:26:25,381 --> 01:26:27,418
You shou
d've gotten a player, too.

967
01:26:28,617 --> 01:26:30,426
Anything else?

968
01:26:36,692 --> 01:26:41,038
Pope's Christmas
gift to seven countries.

969
01:26:41,397 --> 01:26:43,604
"Airdropping cakes"

970
01:26:43,665 --> 01:26:47,511
Instead of cakes...
- They will drop weapons.

971
01:26:49,571 --> 01:26:51,517
We can't do jack!

972
01:26:52,474 --> 01:26:55,250
There's the KGB and CIA.

973
01:26:56,145 --> 01:26:56,748
They'll son it out.

974
01:26:57,012 --> 01:26:58,491
But sir, I'm this close to it.

975
01:26:58,547 --> 01:27:00,254
Would you like to bathe?

976
01:27:01,416 --> 01:27:03,225
You're a free man, Bagchi.

977
01:27:05,154 --> 01:27:06,394
Go back to life.

978
01:27:07,022 --> 01:27:08,194
So long, sir.

979
01:27:17,232 --> 01:27:18,267
Green light.

980
01:27:18,333 --> 01:27:19,277
Yes, sir.

981
01:27:33,181 --> 01:27:36,458
Dodged a 100 obstacles,
on a banana peel, he slipped.

982
01:27:36,518 --> 01:27:40,227
Who else, but Bagchi,
has a fate so flipped?

983
01:27:40,289 --> 01:27:43,736
His destiny is harmed,
fails even the lucky charm.

984
01:27:43,992 --> 01:27:48,566
No charm, no gemstone,
holds favor over his fonune.

985
01:28:01,376 --> 01:28:04,949
His stars align into a
failed constellation.

986
01:28:05,013 --> 01:28:08,290
A stray arrow, too, cannot refuse
his backside's invitation.

987
01:28:08,350 --> 01:28:15,359
It's a complicated situation,
without explanation.

988
01:28:15,424 --> 01:28:23,036
His luck has severe constipation.

989
01:28:31,573 --> 01:28:33,314
Do you know what this is?

990
01:28:34,042 --> 01:28:41,654
This will expose you
and your Godfather, Bashir Alexander.

991
01:28:41,717 --> 01:28:43,128
If this tape goes public...

992
01:28:43,185 --> 01:28:46,496
Happy biﬂhday to you,

993
01:28:47,122 --> 01:28:50,433
Happy biﬂhday to you,

994
01:28:51,126 --> 01:28:52,696
Happy biﬂhday, dear Jagga...

995
01:29:13,649 --> 01:29:15,253
I am Harsh Upadhyay.

996
01:29:15,317 --> 01:29:17,558
Chemistn/ Honors, '93 batch.

997
01:29:19,054 --> 01:29:21,159
It is because of Bagchi-sir that I...

998
01:29:21,223 --> 01:29:24,204
actually, many students like me,

999
01:29:24,259 --> 01:29:26,500
found our sense of purpose.

1000
01:29:27,195 --> 01:29:30,301
This is not a time to mourn him.

1001
01:29:30,732 --> 01:29:34,009
In fact, he was the youngest professor
in our depanment.

1002
01:29:34,336 --> 01:29:35,610
Bad Luck Bagchi.

1003
01:29:36,138 --> 01:29:37,139
<i>30f"!-</i>

1004
01:29:38,140 --> 01:29:39,141
Badal-sir.

1005
01:29:39,541 --> 01:29:40,417
Bagchi-sir.

1006
01:29:42,344 --> 01:29:44,483
He was probably the only professor

1007
01:29:44,546 --> 01:29:47,186
who didn't take attendance in class.

1008
01:29:47,249 --> 01:29:50,389
We, as students could never
understand him...

1009
01:29:52,187 --> 01:29:52,460
I am sorn]...

1010
01:29:52,521 --> 01:29:55,365
I won't be able to speak fuﬂher...
thank you.

1011
01:30:02,598 --> 01:30:05,738
Clouds rumbling in the sky;
teeming rain.

1012
01:30:06,568 --> 01:30:10,038
I sit on the riverbank,
sad and alone.

1013
01:30:10,639 --> 01:30:14,644
The sheaves Iie gathered,
han/est has ended.

1014
01:30:16,044 --> 01:30:18,081
The river is swollen.

1015
01:30:37,566 --> 01:30:38,476
Jagga.

1016
01:30:40,302 --> 01:30:41,406
Hello.

1017
01:30:43,238 --> 01:30:44,740
My name is Kishan Pal Sinha.

1018
01:30:45,607 --> 01:30:48,520
Bagchi was my colleague.

1019
01:30:50,512 --> 01:30:52,685
I put this obituan/
in the newspaper...

1020
01:30:54,216 --> 01:30:56,059
to find you.

1021
01:30:57,586 --> 01:31:01,159
As a matter of fact,
I cremated him, too.

1022
01:31:01,490 --> 01:31:06,064
Had I known he had a son,
I would have waited.

1023
01:31:09,398 --> 01:31:10,741
H... how...

1024
01:31:15,404 --> 01:31:16,747
How... how...

1025
01:31:18,740 --> 01:31:20,276
How did he die?

1026
01:31:21,109 --> 01:31:23,646
Let's go to my office and talk.

1027
01:31:33,255 --> 01:31:34,063
Come.

1028
01:31:36,491 --> 01:31:37,367
Sit.

1029
01:31:42,264 --> 01:31:44,141
When I was a child...

1030
01:31:50,405 --> 01:31:51,816
you left a note.

1031
01:31:52,440 --> 01:31:54,647
What did you write?

1032
01:31:54,710 --> 01:31:55,780
Oh, yes.

1033
01:31:56,044 --> 01:31:56,749
To dad.

1034
01:31:56,812 --> 01:31:59,452
Yes, I wrote a letter to Bagchi.

1035
01:32:01,984 --> 01:32:03,520
Oh, you were there?

1036
01:32:04,720 --> 01:32:07,599
Did your father ever tell
you his full name?

1037
01:32:08,657 --> 01:32:10,330
No?

1038
01:32:10,625 --> 01:32:11,660
Why?

1039
01:32:15,130 --> 01:32:17,076
He... was a nice man.

1040
01:32:17,132 --> 01:32:18,440
He was a ven/ nice man.

1041
01:32:18,500 --> 01:32:20,605
But, he was running from the Police.

1042
01:32:22,504 --> 01:32:24,313
He was charged with murder.

1043
01:32:25,307 --> 01:32:28,288
No. He was framed.

1044
01:32:28,677 --> 01:32:34,423
In the letter, I made an offer to him,
I told him that I would get the charge dropped...

1045
01:32:34,482 --> 01:32:36,462
if he worked for us.

1046
01:32:37,786 --> 01:32:39,424
Who is "Us"?

1047
01:32:41,256 --> 01:32:43,099
I can't tell you that.

1048
01:32:44,192 --> 01:32:45,796
It's confidential.

1049
01:32:48,630 --> 01:32:50,337
Alright.

1050
01:32:52,134 --> 01:32:53,374
Fair enough.

1051
01:32:54,069 --> 01:32:55,514
We need to gain your trust.

1052
01:32:55,570 --> 01:32:56,446
Isn't it?

1053
01:32:56,504 --> 01:32:57,642
Okay.

1054
01:32:58,173 --> 01:33:00,312
This lawyer's office that you see...

1055
01:33:00,375 --> 01:33:02,184
It is just a facade.

1056
01:33:02,344 --> 01:33:04,688
We work for the
intelligence depanment.

1057
01:33:04,746 --> 01:33:06,157
A government body.

1058
01:33:06,448 --> 01:33:09,054
And Bagchi was working for us

1059
01:33:09,751 --> 01:33:11,094
on a ven/ impoﬂant mission.

1060
01:33:11,520 --> 01:33:12,521
Six years of work.

1061
01:33:12,587 --> 01:33:15,693
His hard work of six years
was all on that one tape.

1062
01:33:19,194 --> 01:33:21,003
But, Bagchi being Bagchi...

1063
01:33:22,330 --> 01:33:24,742
he goofed up as usual.

1064
01:33:25,066 --> 01:33:27,307
Do you know what
his friends called him?

1065
01:33:27,369 --> 01:33:29,280
Bad Luck Bagchi.

1066
01:33:29,337 --> 01:33:31,408
Sad, but true.

1067
01:33:32,240 --> 01:33:36,017
Here... this is the tape he gave me.

1068
01:33:36,745 --> 01:33:38,622
This one.

1069
01:33:39,447 --> 01:33:42,519
But, this is your biﬂhday tape.

1070
01:33:42,584 --> 01:33:44,495
And the tape that was to come to us,

1071
01:33:44,519 --> 01:33:46,226
went to you instead.

1072
01:33:47,288 --> 01:33:50,428
Son, if you want this tape,

1073
01:33:52,193 --> 01:33:55,731
you bring us our tape
and take this one in return.

1074
01:33:55,797 --> 01:33:57,799
N... N... N...

1075
01:34:04,606 --> 01:34:06,142
No, I don't have it.

1076
01:34:06,208 --> 01:34:06,743
You do...

1077
01:34:07,008 --> 01:34:10,581
What proof do you have
that he's dead?

1078
01:34:11,179 --> 01:34:12,681
Gupta.
- Yes, sir.

1079
01:34:14,115 --> 01:34:14,490
Sir.

1080
01:34:14,549 --> 01:34:16,290
The body was charred
along with the car.

1081
01:34:16,351 --> 01:34:17,261
Look.

1082
01:34:22,557 --> 01:34:23,763
When did this happen?

1083
01:34:25,093 --> 01:34:26,197
It...

1084
01:34:27,362 --> 01:34:29,399
It happened on 3rd August.

1085
01:34:29,464 --> 01:34:31,000
Three weeks ago.

1086
01:34:31,065 --> 01:34:33,170
It was really a sad day.

1087
01:34:33,401 --> 01:34:35,244
I really...

1088
01:34:42,510 --> 01:34:44,080
He's alive.

1089
01:34:45,347 --> 01:34:46,553

... 
...

1090
01:34:47,115 --> 01:34:51,120
I got a call two weeks ago...

1091
01:34:51,352 --> 01:34:52,695
from dad.

1092
01:34:54,322 --> 01:34:56,302
From Moombaka.

1093
01:35:04,065 --> 01:35:05,601
Here.

1094
01:35:06,601 --> 01:35:08,171
Hold this.

1095
01:35:08,236 --> 01:35:10,443
Write... write down your address.

1096
01:35:11,639 --> 01:35:13,550
What... do you wear to sleep?

1097
01:35:13,608 --> 01:35:17,613
What I mean is,
you'll have to stay here tonight.

1098
01:35:18,446 --> 01:35:19,481
Gupta!

1099
01:35:20,014 --> 01:35:21,425
S hrivastav.
- Sir.

1100
01:35:27,756 --> 01:35:29,360
Some water, please.

1101
01:35:46,040 --> 01:35:47,747
Hey, Gupta.

1102
01:35:48,310 --> 01:35:50,051
Catch him.

1103
01:35:52,714 --> 01:35:54,751
Don't let him escape.

1104
01:36:05,093 --> 01:36:06,367
Catch him!

1105
01:36:28,016 --> 01:36:31,225
Search even] nook
and cranny of Kolkata.

1106
01:36:31,753 --> 01:36:37,203
Even] street, even] hotel,
even] bus stop, even] airport.

1107
01:36:37,258 --> 01:36:39,067
I need Jagga.

1108
01:36:39,127 --> 01:36:42,370
I need my tape... tape.

1109
01:36:53,775 --> 01:36:54,378
Yes?

1110
01:36:54,442 --> 01:36:56,251
Hi... I...

1111
01:36:56,311 --> 01:36:59,155
Pany's over... no one's at home.

1112
01:36:59,214 --> 01:37:01,353
Even/one's left.

1113
01:37:04,385 --> 01:37:08,026
Jagga! What a pleasant surprise!

1114
01:37:08,089 --> 01:37:09,397
It's Shruti's friend...

1115
01:37:10,692 --> 01:37:11,727
Come.

1116
01:37:12,327 --> 01:37:16,241
How many roads must a man...

1117
01:37:19,601 --> 01:37:20,443
Guess who?

1118
01:37:22,170 --> 01:37:23,148
Jagga.

1119
01:37:23,204 --> 01:37:24,706
Jagga? Michael.

1120
01:37:28,043 --> 01:37:29,545
Lights off.

1121
01:37:29,611 --> 01:37:30,612
Sit... sit.

1122
01:37:31,079 --> 01:37:34,526
My neighbor, Ganguly,
is ven/ stuck up.

1123
01:37:36,751 --> 01:37:37,559
Yes?

1124
01:37:37,619 --> 01:37:39,155
No, the paﬂy's over.

1125
01:37:39,220 --> 01:37:41,598
They ate, they drank, they left.

1126
01:37:47,195 --> 01:37:48,071
They've left.

1127
01:37:48,129 --> 01:37:50,439
They ate, they drank, they left.

1128
01:37:50,765 --> 01:37:52,142
They ate, they drank, they left.

1129
01:37:52,167 --> 01:37:53,271
They've left.

1130
01:37:53,334 --> 01:37:55,678
They ate, they drank, they left.

1131
01:37:55,737 --> 01:37:57,273
They've left.

1132
01:37:57,339 --> 01:38:00,411
They ate, they drank, they left.

1133
01:38:00,475 --> 01:38:02,682
They ate, they drank, they left.

1134
01:38:02,944 --> 01:38:05,185
They ate, they drank, they left.

1135
01:38:05,246 --> 01:38:06,190
They've left.

1136
01:38:06,247 --> 01:38:07,590
How come they left?

1137
01:38:07,649 --> 01:38:09,959
They ate, they drank, they left.

1138
01:38:10,018 --> 01:38:12,362
They ate, they drank, they left.

1139
01:38:12,420 --> 01:38:13,364
They've left.

1140
01:38:14,189 --> 01:38:18,569
Empty house, no song, no sonata.

1141
01:38:19,060 --> 01:38:23,236
Empty house, no song, no sonata.

1142
01:38:23,298 --> 01:38:27,178
Ramu's left behind,
the rest have left.

1143
01:38:27,235 --> 01:38:28,612
They've left.

1144
01:38:28,636 --> 01:38:33,517
Banerjee, Ahuja and Khambatta.

1145
01:38:33,541 --> 01:38:37,648
Banerjee, Ahuja and Khambatta.

1146
01:38:37,712 --> 01:38:40,283
Saying goodbye and ta ta.

1147
01:38:40,348 --> 01:38:43,158
They've all left.

1148
01:39:05,173 --> 01:39:06,083
They've left.

1149
01:39:06,140 --> 01:39:08,381
They ate, they drank, they left.

1150
01:39:08,443 --> 01:39:10,946
They ate, they drank, they left.

1151
01:39:10,979 --> 01:39:13,118
They ate, they drank, they left.

1152
01:39:14,482 --> 01:39:21,957
The philosophy of life,
let me simplify.

1153
01:39:22,490 --> 01:39:29,100
Life is too shod,
live it before you die.

1154
01:39:29,264 --> 01:39:33,303
It's a non-stop paﬂy for all,
I believe.

1155
01:39:33,368 --> 01:39:34,073
<i>
</i> agree!

1156
01:39:34,135 --> 01:39:39,084
You eat, you drink and then you leave.

1157
01:39:39,140 --> 01:39:41,279
You eat, you drink and then you leave.

1158
01:39:41,342 --> 01:39:46,155
A life is a good life only if...

1159
01:39:46,447 --> 01:39:50,452
A life is a good life only if...

1160
01:39:50,485 --> 01:39:55,400
Without a wince, you ate,
you drank, you left.

1161
01:39:56,157 --> 01:40:00,606
Empty house, no song, no sonata.

1162
01:40:01,095 --> 01:40:05,202
Empty house, no song, no sonata.

1163
01:40:05,266 --> 01:40:09,180
Ramu's left behind, rest have left.

1164
01:40:09,237 --> 01:40:10,113
They've left.

1165
01:40:10,171 --> 01:40:10,581
Really?

1166
01:40:10,638 --> 01:40:11,548
They've left.

1167
01:40:11,606 --> 01:40:14,086
They ate, they drank, they left.

1168
01:40:14,141 --> 01:40:16,417
They ate, they drank, they left.

1169
01:40:16,477 --> 01:40:18,753
They ate, they drank, they left.

1170
01:40:19,013 --> 01:40:19,718
They've left.

1171
01:40:26,120 --> 01:40:29,567
Do... Do... Do you know him?

1172
01:40:35,397 --> 01:40:37,138
Professor Bagchi?

1173
01:40:38,132 --> 01:40:39,668
Professor Bagchi is your father?

1174
01:40:39,734 --> 01:40:42,305
Yes. He is... T... T...

1175
01:40:42,370 --> 01:40:43,747
He is Tutifuti?
- Y... Yes.

1176
01:40:46,441 --> 01:40:49,047
You know...

1177
01:40:49,110 --> 01:40:50,612
I don't believe it.

1178
01:40:52,080 --> 01:40:56,654
'Puru
ia Arms Drop Bagchi'
is your father?

1179
01:41:00,755 --> 01:41:02,632
Such a small world.

1180
01:41:33,488 --> 01:41:34,296
Step back. Move!

1181
01:41:34,355 --> 01:41:36,335
A shower of weapons in broad daylight.

1182
01:41:36,391 --> 01:41:37,495
17th December...

1183
01:41:37,558 --> 01:41:40,505
- We didn't call him
Bad Luck Bagchi for nothing.

1184
01:41:40,561 --> 01:41:45,601
- With him around, you could be assured
that trouble would follow.

1185
01:41:49,403 --> 01:41:51,610
Not sure, ifthat was
his bad luck or good luck.

1186
01:41:51,639 --> 01:41:54,210
But, had he not have been there,

1187
01:41:54,275 --> 01:41:58,724
the world would have never known
about the Purulia arms drop episode.

1188
01:42:00,114 --> 01:42:03,584
Once Bagchi set his mind
on something; that was it.

1189
01:42:03,651 --> 01:42:06,564
He said, this incident appeared
in front ofthe world by accident.

1190
01:42:06,621 --> 01:42:08,328
Otherwise, such cases
would have continued undiscovered.

1191
01:42:08,389 --> 01:42:13,600
Imagine, a single man alone,
exposed an international conspiracy!

1192
01:42:13,661 --> 01:42:17,165
And spilled it out
on to the streets of Kolkata.

1193
01:42:17,598 --> 01:42:20,169
A foreign aircraft enters
Indian airspace

1194
01:42:20,234 --> 01:42:22,544
openly drops arms

1195
01:42:22,604 --> 01:42:24,777
and doesn't get detected?

1196
01:42:25,106 --> 01:42:27,780
How can that happen without someone
from the inside being involved?

1197
01:42:28,042 --> 01:42:29,112
And you won't print it?

1198
01:42:29,176 --> 01:42:30,154
Sir, I'll lose my job.

1199
01:42:30,211 --> 01:42:32,350
And... the plane's pilot...

1200
01:42:34,115 --> 01:42:35,355
Kim Davey.

1201
01:42:35,416 --> 01:42:38,295
He crossed the border in a VIP car.

1202
01:42:38,319 --> 01:42:39,593
Think about it.
- I'm sorn], sir.

1203
01:42:39,654 --> 01:42:41,224
But, he is right.

1204
01:42:41,289 --> 01:42:42,393
We need facts.

1205
01:42:42,456 --> 01:42:48,168
And to print such a theonj,
we need some proof.

1206
01:42:48,329 --> 01:42:49,239
Proof?

1207
01:42:49,797 --> 01:42:50,673
I'll get you proof.

1208
01:42:50,732 --> 01:42:51,540
Sir...
-Sir...

1209
01:42:51,599 --> 01:42:52,600
No, no. I'll get you the proof.

1210
01:42:52,667 --> 01:42:54,669
Print the ston/ after that.
- Sir, please listen to us.

1211
01:42:54,735 --> 01:42:57,511
And from then on Bagchi-sir
set out to find evidence.

1212
01:42:57,572 --> 01:42:59,813
He would send his student, Samrat
with the evidence.

1213
01:43:00,208 --> 01:43:02,085
Which I kept publishing.

1214
01:43:02,143 --> 01:43:03,349
As he got deeper into the case,

1215
01:43:03,411 --> 01:43:05,220
names of bigger fish staﬂed emerging.

1216
01:43:05,479 --> 01:43:09,325
Obviously, these powerful people
had a problem with him.

1217
01:43:09,383 --> 01:43:10,691
Then one day, Samrat didn't turn up.

1218
01:43:10,752 --> 01:43:14,063
The Police turned up
the next morning.

1219
01:43:24,132 --> 01:43:26,772
The Sinha that you talk about,
was an Investigating Officer.

1220
01:43:27,035 --> 01:43:28,571
He was on the Purulia arms drop case.

1221
01:43:28,636 --> 01:43:30,343
Yes, but he was thrown out
ofthe bureau a while back.

1222
01:43:30,405 --> 01:43:31,509
Corruption charges.

1223
01:43:31,572 --> 01:43:33,245
So then, what secret mission?

1224
01:43:33,307 --> 01:43:35,184
No, it was Sinha's
conspiracy for treason.

1225
01:43:35,243 --> 01:43:36,620
He handpicked seven,
tested and tried men.

1226
01:43:36,677 --> 01:43:39,521
Happy birthday to you.

1227
01:43:40,081 --> 01:43:42,527
Happy birthday to you.

1228
01:43:42,583 --> 01:43:44,529
All were bumped off, except Tutifuti,

1229
01:43:44,585 --> 01:43:46,189
the thorn in his side.

1230
01:43:46,254 --> 01:43:46,595
No, I'm sorn].

1231
01:43:46,654 --> 01:43:48,600
But, how do you know
Bagchi-sir is alive?

1232
01:43:48,656 --> 01:43:50,260
The photograph
of the charred body was fake.

1233
01:43:50,324 --> 01:43:52,395
Never has Tutifuti worn
canvas shoes to date.

1234
01:43:52,460 --> 01:43:53,336
Moombaka's mention aleﬂed Sinha.

1235
01:43:53,394 --> 01:43:55,169
He was worried about
exposing his mission.

1236
01:43:55,229 --> 01:43:57,175
Like the Iie he sought
had been caught.

1237
01:43:57,198 --> 01:43:58,302
How do you know about Moombaka?

1238
01:43:58,365 --> 01:43:59,241
ISD.

1239
01:43:59,300 --> 01:43:59,744
The code?

1240
01:43:59,800 --> 01:44:01,040
+254.

1241
01:44:01,469 --> 01:44:03,142
Whose murder was Bagchi charged with?

1242
01:44:03,204 --> 01:44:05,184
Our friend, Samrat.

1243
01:44:05,239 --> 01:44:08,220
Unfoﬂunately, I was the one
to write out his last ston].

1244
01:44:08,275 --> 01:44:10,221
Stop the car!

1245
01:44:11,379 --> 01:44:13,256
Open the boot.

1246
01:44:14,682 --> 01:44:16,389
It is open.

1247
01:44:18,419 --> 01:44:20,330
Hey. hey. Stop!

1248
01:44:20,688 --> 01:44:22,395
Don't let him get away.

1249
01:44:44,278 --> 01:44:47,521
Gautam Buddha drew
a red circle and said,

1250
01:44:49,383 --> 01:44:52,489
"Iftwo people are destined
to be together,

1251
01:44:52,553 --> 01:44:56,592
they will come into this red circle,

1252
01:44:56,657 --> 01:45:01,037
meet and will never ever separate."

1253
01:45:01,462 --> 01:45:03,442
Like us.

1254
01:45:03,497 --> 01:45:05,101
This is me...

1255
01:45:06,734 --> 01:45:08,338
This is you.

1256
01:45:09,504 --> 01:45:12,246
Jagga, you don't need to convince me.

1257
01:45:13,007 --> 01:45:14,145
If it weren't for you,

1258
01:45:14,208 --> 01:45:15,687
I'd be in jail.

1259
01:45:16,076 --> 01:45:17,680
If you need me, I'm there.

1260
01:45:19,714 --> 01:45:20,749
Yes, sir.

1261
01:45:21,582 --> 01:45:23,061
Really?

1262
01:45:24,752 --> 01:45:25,594
Thank you.

1263
01:45:28,088 --> 01:45:29,590
He said that the passport
and visa would be done.

1264
01:45:29,657 --> 01:45:31,136
Your clue?

1265
01:45:33,094 --> 01:45:34,334
H... Hotel...

1266
01:45:34,695 --> 01:45:36,106
Agapastala.

1267
01:45:37,365 --> 01:45:38,173
And plan?

1268
01:45:41,169 --> 01:45:42,239
Y...You.

1269
01:45:44,705 --> 01:45:49,120
To search for a man in Moombaka
with just his phone number...

1270
01:45:49,176 --> 01:45:52,316
is like looking for the Taj Mahal
in Kolkata.

1271
01:45:52,379 --> 01:45:53,585
T... T... T...

1272
01:45:53,648 --> 01:45:54,592
Taxi.

1273
01:45:54,648 --> 01:45:55,490
Taxi.

1274
01:45:57,285 --> 01:45:58,229
T... T... T...

1275
01:45:58,619 --> 01:45:59,529
Tutifuti?

1276
01:45:59,587 --> 01:46:01,430
T... T... Tutifuti.

1277
01:46:01,656 --> 01:46:02,657
Come with me.

1278
01:46:03,123 --> 01:46:04,363
How will I be of any help?

1279
01:46:04,425 --> 01:46:06,029
Am I a genie?

1280
01:46:06,427 --> 01:46:07,599
Taxi.

1281
01:46:10,264 --> 01:46:12,141
No, a carbon copy.
- Carbon what?

1282
01:46:12,333 --> 01:46:14,609
Of my dad.
- Taxi.

1283
01:46:16,037 --> 01:46:17,107
Taxi.

1284
01:46:21,709 --> 01:46:23,154
Taxi.

1285
01:46:26,547 --> 01:46:29,255
What do you mean that
I'm a copy of your father?

1286
01:46:29,317 --> 01:46:30,421
C... C... C...

1287
01:46:33,621 --> 01:46:35,760
‘Cause you both

1288
01:46:36,023 --> 01:46:38,162
are bad lucky.

1289
01:46:39,093 --> 01:46:41,596
Just come along, Hun.

1290
01:46:41,662 --> 01:46:44,370
A web of bad luck will be spun.

1291
01:46:44,432 --> 01:46:47,504
And the Taj Mahal

1292
01:46:47,568 --> 01:46:51,516
will come to Kolkata, it'll be done.

1293
01:46:52,473 --> 01:46:54,680
‘Cause you both

1294
01:46:54,742 --> 01:46:56,744
are bad lucky.

1295
01:47:12,293 --> 01:47:13,465
Bad luck, huh?

1296
01:47:13,527 --> 01:47:15,234
We won't find Tutifuti.

1297
01:47:15,296 --> 01:47:18,243
Instead, you will be doomed
with my bad luck.

1298
01:47:18,299 --> 01:47:20,506
No... no!

1299
01:47:21,035 --> 01:47:23,743
In Ukhrul, you got stuck.

1300
01:47:24,005 --> 01:47:25,348
Your bad luck

1301
01:47:25,406 --> 01:47:26,544
was my good luck.

1302
01:47:26,607 --> 01:47:31,454
We were meant to meet.

1303
01:47:31,579 --> 01:47:36,289
You'll take me to my dad,
the journey... complete.

1304
01:47:37,251 --> 01:47:39,527
‘Cause you both

1305
01:47:39,586 --> 01:47:41,122
are bad lucky.

1306
01:47:41,189 --> 01:47:45,103
I never thought
you could be this illogical!

1307
01:47:45,726 --> 01:47:48,502
I've studied the science of bad luck,

1308
01:47:48,562 --> 01:47:51,304
through and through.

1309
01:47:51,365 --> 01:47:54,312
Just trust in me

1310
01:47:54,368 --> 01:47:56,211
and I guarantee.

1311
01:47:56,270 --> 01:47:57,180
What nonsense!

1312
01:47:57,405 --> 01:48:02,354
The banana peel,
that made my father slip...

1313
01:48:02,610 --> 01:48:07,252
Now, the same peel
will make you flip.

1314
01:48:07,448 --> 01:48:09,985
‘Cause you both

1315
01:48:10,050 --> 01:48:12,223
are bad lucky.

1316
01:48:12,620 --> 01:48:15,157
‘Cause you both

1317
01:48:15,222 --> 01:48:17,327
are bad lucky.

1318
01:48:18,125 --> 01:48:19,604
Theon/ won't do.

1319
01:48:19,660 --> 01:48:20,968
Prove it, practically.

1320
01:48:21,028 --> 01:48:22,439
Then, I'll believe you.

1321
01:48:23,397 --> 01:48:25,638
C... C... Cool.

1322
01:48:44,652 --> 01:48:47,258
36 eggs, one is cracked.

1323
01:48:47,321 --> 01:48:49,767
You will pick that one, I'm sure.

1324
01:48:50,024 --> 01:48:54,200
My dad's bad luck is same as yours,

1325
01:48:55,329 --> 01:49:00,074
you'll be drawn towards
the broken egg's allure.

1326
01:49:00,768 --> 01:49:02,975
‘Cause you are

1327
01:49:03,003 --> 01:49:04,505
that bad lucky.

1328
01:49:28,229 --> 01:49:30,266
‘Cause you both

1329
01:49:30,331 --> 01:49:32,311
are bad lucky.

1330
01:49:33,400 --> 01:49:35,607
‘Cause you both

1331
01:49:35,670 --> 01:49:38,378
are bad lucky.

1332
01:49:43,443 --> 01:49:44,649
No, sir.

1333
01:49:44,711 --> 01:49:46,384
We've checked the school,
hostel, even/where.

1334
01:49:46,414 --> 01:49:47,484
No luck.

1335
01:49:47,548 --> 01:49:49,550
Why am I not surprised?

1336
01:49:49,617 --> 01:49:51,563
But, sir. I've got interesting news.

1337
01:49:51,618 --> 01:49:54,360
Last month in Burma...
- Sir, here. Have some hot tea.

1338
01:49:54,422 --> 01:49:56,197
the arms racket bust,

1339
01:49:56,256 --> 01:49:57,997
was Jaggafs 110N19-

1340
01:49:58,025 --> 01:50:01,768
This means that the tape
is definitely with him.

1341
01:50:02,563 --> 01:50:03,667
And if he didn't have the tape,

1342
01:50:03,731 --> 01:50:06,507
he would never have been able
to figure out the Burma route.

1343
01:50:07,034 --> 01:50:08,240
Anything else?

1344
01:50:08,402 --> 01:50:11,315
And sir, a journalist from Kolkata
was with him.

1345
01:50:11,705 --> 01:50:13,548
Shruti. Shruti Sengupta.

1346
01:50:13,607 --> 01:50:15,245
Shruti Sengupta, sir.

1347
01:50:15,609 --> 01:50:17,714
Shruti Sengupta.

1348
01:50:21,382 --> 01:50:23,692
Can't believe I'm doing this.

1349
01:50:25,619 --> 01:50:28,566
If your bad luck theon/ backfires,

1350
01:50:28,622 --> 01:50:30,465
don't blame me.

1351
01:50:30,691 --> 01:50:33,672
Pray that the plane takes off safely.

1352
01:50:35,696 --> 01:50:38,176
S... S... Seat-belt.

1353
01:50:38,332 --> 01:50:40,039
<i>30f"!-</i>

1354
01:50:57,384 --> 01:50:58,328
Sir.

1355
01:50:59,687 --> 01:51:01,064
Sir, the tape.

1356
01:51:03,224 --> 01:51:04,134
It happens, sir.

1357
01:51:19,406 --> 01:51:22,444
Welcome to Moombaka.
 You want my gun?

1358
01:51:35,089 --> 01:51:37,399
Hey! What is this?

1359
01:51:38,292 --> 01:51:40,272
You are damaging my car!

1360
01:51:41,795 --> 01:51:44,275
Will you buy me a new car?

1361
01:51:44,331 --> 01:51:47,141
What is wrong with you?

1362
01:51:53,273 --> 01:51:54,547
What are you doing?

1363
01:51:55,042 --> 01:51:55,543
Shooting.

1364
01:51:56,110 --> 01:51:57,453
What did I tell you to do?

1365
01:51:57,678 --> 01:52:00,181
Did I ask you to shoot
or follow them?

1366
01:52:00,347 --> 01:52:00,825
Shoot.

1367
01:52:01,048 --> 01:52:01,753
Huh?

1368
01:52:02,416 --> 01:52:03,554
Follow?

1369
01:52:14,995 --> 01:52:15,598
Where?

1370
01:52:15,629 --> 01:52:17,267
Hotel Agapastala.

1371
01:52:17,331 --> 01:52:19,106
Which Agapastala?

1372
01:52:19,133 --> 01:52:20,737
What do you mean which Agapastala?

1373
01:52:22,402 --> 01:52:24,109
Beside Labambala.

1374
01:52:24,238 --> 01:52:26,184
You mean there are more than one?

1375
01:52:26,240 --> 01:52:28,049
How many Agapastalas are there?

1376
01:52:28,108 --> 01:52:29,348
100 total.

1377
01:52:29,410 --> 01:52:30,616
In the Moombaka nation.

1378
01:52:30,678 --> 01:52:31,281
What?

1379
01:52:31,345 --> 01:52:32,585
<i>No, no, 98.</i>

1380
01:52:32,646 --> 01:52:34,216
I hope you're joking, right?

1381
01:52:34,348 --> 01:52:36,191
Even/thing's set.

1382
01:52:36,250 --> 01:52:38,025
I swear to God.

1383
01:52:38,085 --> 01:52:39,462
Oh, you're such a fraud.

1384
01:52:39,520 --> 01:52:42,763
Just like even] African jungle

1385
01:52:43,023 --> 01:52:45,094
has a deer named Impala.

1386
01:52:45,159 --> 01:52:46,263
Come to the point.

1387
01:52:46,326 --> 01:52:49,603
Similarly, in Moombaka at even] turn

1388
01:52:49,663 --> 01:52:51,301
there's a Hotel Agapastala.

1389
01:52:51,365 --> 01:52:52,639
Beside Labambala?

1390
01:52:52,666 --> 01:52:54,646
Why didn't you tell me before?
- You never asked me before.

1391
01:52:54,668 --> 01:52:56,375
Hotel Agapastala?

1392
01:52:56,437 --> 01:52:58,041
Yes, Agapastala.
- Yes, Agapastala.

1393
01:52:58,105 --> 01:53:00,381
Okay... okay.

1394
01:53:38,545 --> 01:53:40,650
Yes. Tell me, Gupta.

1395
01:53:40,714 --> 01:53:42,216
Sir, we've found the tape.

1396
01:53:43,650 --> 01:53:45,129
What are you saying?

1397
01:53:46,486 --> 01:53:48,090
Are you sure it's the right tape?

1398
01:53:48,389 --> 01:53:49,561
Did you check it?

1399
01:53:50,524 --> 01:53:52,595
Sinha, Ahuja here.

1400
01:53:53,661 --> 01:53:56,232
I saw your tape. All okay.

1401
01:53:56,296 --> 01:54:00,335
Sinha, just get rid ofthese two kids.

1402
01:54:01,034 --> 01:54:02,308
Sir, but...

1403
01:54:02,670 --> 01:54:04,308
the deal was for the tape.

1404
01:54:05,172 --> 01:54:06,014
Not to get rid ofthem.

1405
01:54:06,073 --> 01:54:09,282
You family is waiting
for you in Nainital.

1406
01:54:10,144 --> 01:54:13,057
And you want to play deal or no deal?

1407
01:54:13,314 --> 01:54:16,022
Well you are absolutely right, sir.

1408
01:54:16,583 --> 01:54:18,062
Alright.

1409
01:54:18,151 --> 01:54:19,494
I will finish the job and then return.

1410
01:54:25,025 --> 01:54:25,730
Give me the gun.

1411
01:54:25,993 --> 01:54:28,769
The small one, please.

1412
01:54:29,229 --> 01:54:30,105
Shall I go, sir?

1413
01:54:30,163 --> 01:54:31,073
Last chance.

1414
01:54:31,131 --> 01:54:32,109
Sir.

1415
01:54:34,368 --> 01:54:35,506
Sit right here.

1416
01:55:23,416 --> 01:55:26,192
No, I don't know.

1417
01:56:35,255 --> 01:56:36,131
Passport

1418
01:56:36,223 --> 01:56:36,963
These two?

1419
01:56:38,325 --> 01:56:39,531
Money?

1420
01:56:40,194 --> 01:56:41,002
ln my b89-

1421
01:57:07,054 --> 01:57:10,695
Why does it go where it shouldn't?

1422
01:57:11,091 --> 01:57:13,435
This head's a fool.

1423
01:57:14,628 --> 01:57:18,735
Why tn/ a fractured destiny?

1424
01:57:18,966 --> 01:57:21,412
This head's a fool.

1425
01:57:22,636 --> 01:57:26,607
Why does it go where it shouldn't?

1426
01:57:26,673 --> 01:57:29,085
This head's a fool.

1427
01:57:30,377 --> 01:57:34,519
Why tn/ a fractured destiny?

1428
01:57:34,581 --> 01:57:37,118
This head's a fool.

1429
01:57:38,985 --> 01:57:42,990
Senseless are its ways.

1430
01:57:43,056 --> 01:57:46,663
Knowingly invites trouble grave.

1431
01:57:50,330 --> 01:57:54,278
In a flash it comes and goes,

1432
01:57:54,334 --> 01:57:57,110
this head is like small change.

1433
01:57:58,104 --> 01:58:02,109
Why does it go where it shouldn't?

1434
01:58:02,176 --> 01:58:04,417
This head's a fool.

1435
01:58:32,105 --> 01:58:33,516
It's confused.

1436
01:58:33,540 --> 01:58:37,420
It believes in friendship.

1437
01:58:37,444 --> 01:58:41,392
Lost in the colors of friendship.

1438
01:58:41,448 --> 01:58:45,726
Drenched in love.

1439
01:58:46,419 --> 01:58:50,231
Can't escape it,

1440
01:58:50,290 --> 01:58:53,100
can't let it go.

1441
01:58:53,159 --> 01:58:57,232
Makes castles in the air,

1442
01:58:57,297 --> 01:59:00,039
this head's a king's lair.

1443
01:59:01,068 --> 01:59:05,073
Why does it go where it shouldn't?

1444
01:59:05,138 --> 01:59:07,448
This head's a fool.

1445
01:59:39,406 --> 01:59:42,478
M... M... My lips were dn].

1446
01:59:46,079 --> 01:59:49,424
Please get me one omlette.

1447
01:59:52,552 --> 01:59:54,259
They have taken this route.

1448
01:59:54,321 --> 01:59:56,096
I know where they are going.

1449
01:59:56,489 --> 01:59:58,059
Shundi.

1450
02:00:20,480 --> 02:00:22,323
Search the whole place.

1451
02:00:58,418 --> 02:01:01,592
Across 56 hotels,
the search is complete.

1452
02:01:01,655 --> 02:01:04,727
20 more to go,

1453
02:01:05,258 --> 02:01:08,034
the target is close.

1454
02:01:08,395 --> 02:01:10,204
Just two days more!

1455
02:01:11,398 --> 02:01:12,468
Sorn], Jagga-

1456
02:01:12,499 --> 02:01:14,069
It's not going to work.

1457
02:01:14,401 --> 02:01:15,402
I'm going back to India.

1458
02:01:15,435 --> 02:01:18,644
You said that you'll be

1459
02:01:18,705 --> 02:01:22,084
there for me when I need you.

1460
02:01:22,342 --> 02:01:25,289
Live up to your promise.

1461
02:01:25,345 --> 02:01:27,154
Just two days more!

1462
02:01:27,247 --> 02:01:28,225
Listen, I'm here to help you.

1463
02:01:28,281 --> 02:01:30,488
But, I have a problem with your ways.

1464
02:01:30,550 --> 02:01:31,255
Okay?

1465
02:01:31,318 --> 02:01:32,126
What about money?

1466
02:01:32,185 --> 02:01:33,425
No problem, honey.

1467
02:01:33,486 --> 02:01:35,227
The police are chasing us.

1468
02:01:35,288 --> 02:01:36,631
They'll never catch us, no way.

1469
02:01:36,689 --> 02:01:38,600
Jagga, they even shot at us.

1470
02:01:38,658 --> 02:01:40,331
But failed miserably, didn't they?

1471
02:01:40,393 --> 02:01:41,667
Do you think this is a joke?

1472
02:01:41,728 --> 02:01:43,799
You think I'm going to spend my life

1473
02:01:44,064 --> 02:01:46,544
dancing with you
in the streets of Moombaka?

1474
02:01:46,599 --> 02:01:51,708
Ifthere is a slightest chance
that Tutifuti is alive,

1475
02:01:51,738 --> 02:01:58,747
then even that is good enough
for me to find him.

1476
02:01:58,812 --> 02:02:05,354
Who can understand better
as to how I feel, other than you.

1477
02:02:05,418 --> 02:02:13,337
You, who still celebrates
your dead boyfriend's biﬂhday, too.

1478
02:02:20,200 --> 02:02:21,474
S... S... S...

1479
02:02:21,735 --> 02:02:22,236
<i>30f"!-</i>

1480
02:02:22,302 --> 02:02:23,144
Don't be.

1481
02:02:24,071 --> 02:02:25,175
It's true.

1482
02:02:26,039 --> 02:02:27,017
Thanks.

1483
02:02:29,476 --> 02:02:31,478
Sorn]... sorn].

1484
02:02:33,013 --> 02:02:35,459
No one can replace Akash.

1485
02:02:36,583 --> 02:02:38,153
Akash?

1486
02:02:38,518 --> 02:02:39,690

\/I... me?

1487
02:02:40,353 --> 02:02:43,562
What tangent.)

1488
02:02:44,624 --> 02:02:45,534
What?

1489
02:02:46,159 --> 02:02:47,604
One... day, please.

1490
02:02:48,161 --> 02:02:49,196
24 hours.

1491
02:02:49,262 --> 02:02:51,139
Not even 24 seconds.

1492
02:02:51,464 --> 02:02:56,072
Then, tell me...

1493
02:02:56,669 --> 02:02:58,774
What I have been saying all along.

1494
02:02:59,039 --> 02:03:00,279
We don't know anyone here.

1495
02:03:00,340 --> 02:03:01,410
So, let us go to the embassy first.

1496
02:03:01,474 --> 02:03:03,010
Okay.

1497
02:03:03,677 --> 02:03:04,655
Now.

1498
02:03:05,479 --> 02:03:06,981
Now?

1499
02:03:09,282 --> 02:03:10,454
O... O... Okay.

1500
02:03:20,593 --> 02:03:22,595
S... S... S...

1501
02:03:28,101 --> 02:03:29,136
Why don't you put a signboard there?

1502
02:03:29,202 --> 02:03:31,307
Sorn], sir. Relax.

1503
02:03:31,371 --> 02:03:32,281
Relax.

1504
02:03:32,739 --> 02:03:35,049
R... R... Relax?

1505
02:03:36,776 --> 02:03:39,450
There's no railing.
Anyone can fall.

1506
02:03:40,380 --> 02:03:42,360
No, no. Nobody falls.

1507
02:03:42,582 --> 02:03:45,688
This city,
all building, same architecture.

1508
02:03:45,752 --> 02:03:47,789
Same style, same steps.

1509
02:03:48,054 --> 02:03:48,759
Look.

1510
02:03:54,594 --> 02:03:57,074
Only that Indian upstairs.
- Sabaka!

1511
02:03:57,130 --> 02:03:58,040
Indian, what?

1512
02:03:58,097 --> 02:03:58,768
Sorn], madam. Relax.

1513
02:03:59,032 --> 02:04:00,306
Are you making fun of Indians?

1514
02:04:00,366 --> 02:04:01,674
No... no.

1515
02:04:01,735 --> 02:04:02,679
No. I want to know.

1516
02:04:02,969 --> 02:04:04,277
These boys say,

1517
02:04:04,337 --> 02:04:05,748
they've been working for 20 years,

1518
02:04:05,972 --> 02:04:07,508
no one has ever fallen down.

1519
02:04:07,540 --> 02:04:10,680
But this year, two people fell down.

1520
02:04:11,611 --> 02:04:13,090
Both Indian.

1521
02:04:18,685 --> 02:04:20,164
T... T... T...

1522
02:04:21,988 --> 02:04:23,695
No. Not this person.

1523
02:04:24,024 --> 02:04:25,469
That man had a beard.

1524
02:04:34,100 --> 02:04:37,081
Yes... yes.

1525
02:04:46,012 --> 02:04:49,016
From 3rd July to 20th July.

1526
02:04:49,082 --> 02:04:51,289
Mr. B. B. Bagchi.

1527
02:04:51,318 --> 02:04:52,661
From India.

1528
02:04:55,555 --> 02:04:56,659
He stayed here?

1529
02:04:57,090 --> 02:04:58,194
Strange man.

1530
02:04:58,258 --> 02:05:01,239
Went out and came back
at the oddest hours.

1531
02:05:01,628 --> 02:05:03,039
Where did he go?

1532
02:05:03,096 --> 02:05:04,336
Shundi.

1533
02:07:33,680 --> 02:07:35,387
Hey, freeze!

1534
02:07:35,448 --> 02:07:37,394
Yeah, okay.

1535
02:07:38,718 --> 02:07:41,358
It's been a long chase.

1536
02:07:41,721 --> 02:07:43,223
How you've made me run!

1537
02:07:43,523 --> 02:07:45,332
Did you find Bagchi?

1538
02:07:46,493 --> 02:07:48,131
You know what?

1539
02:07:48,361 --> 02:07:50,272
I shou
d've killed
you that day itself.

1540
02:07:50,330 --> 02:07:51,775
Cunning, aren't you?

1541
02:07:52,565 --> 02:07:54,374
You made a guess?

1542
02:07:54,434 --> 02:07:56,107
"Bagchi's a
ive."

1543
02:07:56,502 --> 02:07:58,140
Is he?

1544
02:07:58,771 --> 02:07:59,681

... 
...

1545
02:07:59,739 --> 02:08:01,980
I agree that I bluffed.

1546
02:08:02,141 --> 02:08:04,178
You, too, tried.

1547
02:08:04,610 --> 02:08:07,147
And fed me some lies.

1548
02:08:07,213 --> 02:08:09,420
With a fake photo that implied,

1549
02:08:09,482 --> 02:08:13,555
a living man is dead.

1550
02:08:14,654 --> 02:08:17,191
The one I seek,

1551
02:08:17,257 --> 02:08:19,635
is the one you want to find.

1552
02:08:19,692 --> 02:08:24,107
We both have only Tutifuti
on our mind.

1553
02:08:24,163 --> 02:08:27,110
I guessed it right.

1554
02:08:27,367 --> 02:08:28,471
Guessed it right.

1555
02:08:28,534 --> 02:08:30,013
Oh my, Bull's eye!

1556
02:08:30,036 --> 02:08:31,208
I guessed it right.

1557
02:08:31,237 --> 02:08:32,409
Oh my, Bull's eye!

1558
02:08:32,438 --> 02:08:35,009
Caught even] sin,
wiped off your grin.

1559
02:08:35,074 --> 02:08:38,078
Oh my, Bull's eye!

1560
02:08:41,514 --> 02:08:43,187
You can't do jack!

1561
02:08:44,350 --> 02:08:46,523
Your guess was right, I agree.

1562
02:08:46,586 --> 02:08:49,362
Dead or alive,
Bagchi is no use to me.

1563
02:08:49,422 --> 02:08:52,369
You going back to India,

1564
02:08:52,425 --> 02:08:54,462
is a threat to me.

1565
02:08:54,560 --> 02:08:57,666
Hence, I won't let you go soot-free.

1566
02:08:59,032 --> 02:08:59,737
Kill him.

1567
02:09:00,300 --> 02:09:01,176
All ofyou...

1568
02:09:01,234 --> 02:09:02,269
kill him, kill him, kill him.

1569
02:09:04,704 --> 02:09:10,711
If you let us go,
I will marn/ all of you!

1570
02:09:22,121 --> 02:09:24,260
Should I make another guess?
- Go ahead.

1571
02:09:24,324 --> 02:09:26,497
Operation Weapons Drop was a sham.

1572
02:09:26,559 --> 02:09:28,732
You needed six more like Bagchi

1573
02:09:28,995 --> 02:09:30,497
t0 make a spy QTOUP.

1574
02:09:30,563 --> 02:09:31,234
Yes, I had to scam.

1575
02:09:31,297 --> 02:09:33,334
With information about the big fish,

1576
02:09:33,399 --> 02:09:35,572
you planned to make money and scram.
- Yes, true.

1577
02:09:35,635 --> 02:09:39,412
Politicians, businessmen,
Defence Ministers were blackmailed.

1578
02:09:39,472 --> 02:09:42,419
But, this time your plan failed.

1579
02:09:42,475 --> 02:09:44,978
The incorrect tape ended up wrong.

1580
02:09:45,011 --> 02:09:46,513
And Bagchi flew along.

1581
02:09:46,579 --> 02:09:47,182
Mistake.

1582
02:09:47,213 --> 02:09:48,749
Our bones you want to break,

1583
02:09:49,015 --> 02:09:51,689
‘cause your life's at stake.

1584
02:09:51,717 --> 02:09:55,426
We both know Bagchi's
alive and kicking.

1585
02:09:55,655 --> 02:09:57,692
You're right, again.

1586
02:09:58,591 --> 02:09:59,501
Your guess, and mine

1587
02:09:59,559 --> 02:10:00,697
Oh my, Bull's eye!

1588
02:10:00,760 --> 02:10:02,000
Your guess, and mine

1589
02:10:02,061 --> 02:10:03,199
Oh my, Bull's eye!

1590
02:10:03,262 --> 02:10:04,240
How much you sing!

1591
02:10:04,297 --> 02:10:05,367
It's so irritating.

1592
02:10:05,431 --> 02:10:06,637
Kill him, kill him, kill him!

1593
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:07,501
Kill him now.

1594
02:10:07,566 --> 02:10:08,567
Your guess, and mine

1595
02:10:08,635 --> 02:10:09,636
Oh my, Bull's eye!

1596
02:10:09,702 --> 02:10:10,737
Your guess, and mine

1597
02:10:11,003 --> 02:10:11,777
Oh my, Bull's eye!

1598
02:10:12,038 --> 02:10:14,143
Caught even] sin,
wiped off your grin.

1599
02:10:14,207 --> 02:10:16,483
Oh my, Bull's eye!

1600
02:11:51,571 --> 02:11:53,414
What? Tick tack toe?

1601
02:12:03,416 --> 02:12:05,089
Look in the back.

1602
02:12:11,724 --> 02:12:12,759
Ludo?

1603
02:14:22,388 --> 02:14:26,427
He was in a car accident.

1604
02:14:26,492 --> 02:14:28,335
The car crashed into a tree. Boom!

1605
02:14:28,661 --> 02:14:30,436
He left this behind when he left.

1606
02:14:40,172 --> 02:14:43,449
To get to Bashir Alexander
was our mission.

1607
02:14:43,509 --> 02:14:46,718
But Sinha was actually
using us to get information.

1608
02:14:47,413 --> 02:14:49,188
If it weren't for these tribal folk,

1609
02:14:49,248 --> 02:14:52,195
I'd be dead, like the rest of my team.

1610
02:14:52,518 --> 02:14:55,328
And if I'm alive, it's because
there is a purpose:

1611
02:14:55,387 --> 02:14:58,231
I want to tell the world
and expose this illegal arms racket.

1612
02:14:58,324 --> 02:15:02,170
Bashir-Alexander are not two,
but one man.

1613
02:15:02,428 --> 02:15:05,238
In 1960, he was born in Afghanistan.

1614
02:15:05,498 --> 02:15:08,308
He was a normal child
but had two heads.

1615
02:15:08,367 --> 02:15:12,611
He was a child when his father sold
him to the traveling Russian circus.

1616
02:15:13,038 --> 02:15:15,143
Soon he ousted the owner

1617
02:15:15,207 --> 02:15:17,551
and became the boss - the king.

1618
02:15:17,609 --> 02:15:19,646
No one has ever seen him since.

1619
02:15:19,712 --> 02:15:21,214
He went underground.

1620
02:15:21,447 --> 02:15:25,486
A foreign arms facton/
was to be auctioned.

1621
02:15:25,551 --> 02:15:27,087
There was just one bidder.

1622
02:15:27,153 --> 02:15:28,757
Bashir-Alexander.

1623
02:15:29,288 --> 02:15:33,759
CIA, KGB, RAW... none ofthem
even have a picture of him.

1624
02:15:34,293 --> 02:15:37,433
But even] three years,

people say, you can
spot Bashir-Alexander.

1626
02:15:42,334 --> 02:15:45,611
This time, this Fair of Death
will be in Moombaka.

1627
02:15:45,671 --> 02:15:49,346

Come what may,
I have to catch this train.

02:16:07,559 --> 02:16:09,368
They've come.

1639
02:17:03,482 --> 02:17:05,052
10:30, last night.

1640
02:17:05,417 --> 02:17:06,452
To where?

Moombaka border.

1642
02:17:08,687 --> 02:17:11,600
When is the next train?
- None... only one private train.

1643
02:17:11,657 --> 02:17:12,658
Where has it reached?

1644
02:17:12,725 --> 02:17:14,636
The circus train... must be here.

1645
02:17:15,394 --> 02:17:16,964
He's saying it was a circus train.

1646
02:17:17,029 --> 02:17:18,474
Yes, a circus train. Look.

1647
02:17:18,497 --> 02:17:20,204
How much time do you need
to get there?

1648
02:17:21,033 --> 02:17:23,707
About one day's journey.

1649
02:17:25,070 --> 02:17:25,605
Hey!

1650
02:17:26,739 --> 02:17:28,548
That's my scooter.

02:17:28,974 --> 02:17:30,612
That's my scooter... my scooter!

1652
02:17:31,443 --> 02:17:32,444
Oh my God!

1653
02:17:39,351 --> 02:17:40,762
I'll kill both of you!

1654
02:17:48,494 --> 02:17:50,235

02:17:50,296 --> 02:17:52,537
T... T... The controls on this plane
are in the back.

02:17:52,598 --> 02:17:53,599

Accelerator.

1662
02:18:17,089 --> 02:18:18,193
Yes, your left.

1663
02:18:18,257 --> 02:18:19,292
Not there?
- Got it.

1664
02:18:20,359 --> 02:18:20,962
Next?

1665
02:18:21,026 --> 02:18:21,970
Pressure check.

1673
02:18:36,509 --> 02:18:38,489

1677
02:18:45,617 --> 02:18:47,426
Fingers and toes crossed.

1678
02:18:47,486 --> 02:18:49,557
Take off! Take off!

1679
02:19:35,334 --> 02:19:37,245
How will we land now?

1680
02:19:37,970 --> 02:19:39,677
I'll just turn even/thing off.

1681
02:22:15,527 --> 02:22:18,371
Hurn/ up! Come out!

What were you doing inside?

1683
02:22:21,399 --> 02:22:22,742
Is this a joke?

1684
02:22:24,603 --> 02:22:27,709
Special mention for India,
a flourishing market.

1685
02:22:27,772 --> 02:22:29,251

Congratulations!

1688
02:24:28,693 --> 02:24:31,606
Where had we reached
in this search for Tutifuti?

In the Fair of Death,

1690
02:24:37,068 --> 02:24:42,211
No friend, no foe,
just simple principles.

1691
02:24:42,674 --> 02:24:44,745
Get the world to fight,
as they grease their pockets.

1692
02:24:45,243 --> 02:24:48,747
Divide to sell arms,
sell arms to divide.

1693
02:24:50,048 --> 02:24:54,292
One day we will be extinct

1694
02:24:54,352 --> 02:24:58,357
like the dinosaurs.

In this Fair of Death,
Tutifuti was somewhere.

1705
02:25:24,516 --> 02:25:28,430
Did he even come here?
We were unaware.

1706
02:25:28,687 --> 02:25:31,065
Jagga was faced with two options:

1707
02:25:31,456 --> 02:25:34,266
Either continue to search for Tutifuti
which was his mission.

1708
02:25:34,459 --> 02:25:38,669
Or complete Tutifuti's mission.

1709
02:25:51,509 --> 02:25:52,146
Let's go.

1710
02:25:53,045 --> 02:25:54,547
Tutifuti?

1711
02:25:54,613 --> 02:25:58,254
If... If it was him here, he would...

1712
02:26:01,987 --> 02:26:02,431
Let's go.

1713
02:26:18,970 --> 02:26:20,449
Hands up!

1714
02:26:22,707 --> 02:26:24,380
Hands up! Freeze!

1715
02:26:35,520 --> 02:26:38,399
Do you still have faith
in your bad luck theon]?

In breaking news...

1735
02:35:02,660 --> 02:35:04,970
an anonymous video
surfaced last night...

1736
02:35:05,029 --> 02:35:07,270
Bashir-Alexander, the most dreaded
arms dealer in the world...

1737
02:35:07,332 --> 02:35:09,710
Bashir-Alexander...

1738
02:35:09,968 --> 02:35:11,641
The source of the video
is not known yet.

1739
02:35:11,703 --> 02:35:13,205
But the video is genuine,

1740
02:35:13,271 --> 02:35:16,013
and so is our intention
to fight global terrorism.

1741
02:35:28,753 --> 02:35:33,361
I want to travel,

1742
02:35:34,025 --> 02:35:38,303
with you as my guide.

1743
02:35:39,297 --> 02:35:44,042
My destination

1744
02:35:44,469 --> 02:35:49,475
is where you reside.

1745
02:35:49,674 --> 02:35:55,022

Wherever you are,

1748
02:36:05,423 --> 02:36:09,530
is where my head stays.

1749
02:36:09,560 --> 02:36:14,509
Not a soul around,

1750
02:36:14,565 --> 02:36:19,446
we are all alone.

1751
02:36:20,137 --> 02:36:24,586
Don't ever leave me,

1752
02:36:25,276 --> 02:36:30,248
don't leave me Iovelorn.

1753
02:36:43,627 --> 02:36:45,231
Jagga, We love you!

1754
02:37:03,581 --> 02:37:05,254
How wonderful it would be,

1755
02:37:05,316 --> 02:37:07,523
if sweets came out of a box of guns?

1756
02:37:07,585 --> 02:37:10,964
And bombs were filled with
chocolate cream?

1757
02:37:11,022 --> 02:37:14,731
One box had cakes, the other guns.

1758
02:37:14,992 --> 02:37:19,407
Jagga just switched the covers
and won this war!

1759
02:38:01,105 --> 02:38:04,348
What happened to the lights?
