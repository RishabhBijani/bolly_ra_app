1
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:40,930
Meenakshi.

2
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:57,430
Mohini.

3
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:59,760
Mohini, get to your
rehearsals and I'll just...

4
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:03,970
And you'll sit and drink here,
while I'll dance there.

5
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,930
If someone else had said this,
I would've killed him.

6
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:12,390
You cannot kill me.

7
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:16,300
Because I pay for your liquor,
your gambling, everything.

8
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,050
I am profitable for you, father.

9
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,050
And you don't have the courage
to shut down this profitable shop.

10
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:29,180
Hello, listeners.

11
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:32,140
Welcome to All India Radio.

12
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,970
Action!

13
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:48,680
Say that you're mine
Or else

14
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:53,430
I want to die

15
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:57,800
Don't ever say that

16
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:02,430
Don't ever do that

17
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:08,930
Do that, do that, do that
Do that, do that, do that

18
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:13,600
Chaalbaaz.

19
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,430
Wonder where she's from?

20
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:18,010
Wonder where she'll go?

21
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:22,800
She'll definitely make someone crazy

22
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,300
It's a small encounter

23
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:29,350
But it's so sad

24
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:35,470
This girl won't be wooed by anyone

25
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:41,050
This girl won't be wooed by anyone

26
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,850
My sweetheart!

27
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,850
Oh my!

28
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,720
Oh my!

29
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,300
Mr. India!

30
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,350
Oh my!

31
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:14,720
I love you

32
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,890
From Doom to Doom.

33
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,550
Sridevi, Madhuri and Juhi.

34
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,510
Sometimes this, sometimes that.

35
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:35,100
It's a wonderful day
Think about it

36
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:41,510
The madness
Take a look

37
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:45,180
You're alone
I am alone

38
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,100
We're having fun!

39
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,220
I swear

40
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:52,890
I swear

41
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:01,640
Sunny, Anil...
Bobby, Rishi.

42
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,260
Save me! Save me!

43
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:05,180
Someone save me!

44
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:10,470
Aamir, Shah Rukh...
Sallu, Saifu... No!

45
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:13,350
No. Stop!

46
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:18,430
SK, Akki, Duggu, Bhaggu,
Dhaggu, Dabbu, Pappu.

47
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:21,050
Someone save me.

48
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:25,050
Save me! Save me!

49
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,350
Nana, congratulations.

50
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,430
Meenakshi's name's in the newspaper.

51
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,470
Meenakshi's name's in the newspaper?

52
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:36,100
-Slowly, Mom.
-Show me what's written about Meenakshi.

53
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,350
What's written?

54
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,140
Mom, Dad, grandma.

55
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,890
Meenakshi's name's in the papers.

56
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,640
Tell me what's written
about Meenakshi.

57
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:48,850
Give it here.

58
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:54,720
Nana, read it.
Read it, Nana.

59
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:59,510
Attention. Attention everyone.

60
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:02,350
"A Brahmin girl, age..."

61
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,680
Twenty-two?

62
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,220
Bunch of liars!

63
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,760
You will all go to hell.

64
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,050
And rot to death.

65
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:12,100
You can't get anyone married by lying.

66
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,970
This family will never have an heir.

67
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:16,010
We'll face droughts, cloudburst...

68
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,100
This house will be washed away.

69
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:22,260
Mother-in-law, stop dreaming
behind those sunglasses.

70
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,680
Nana, read it.

71
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:27,720
"A Brahmin girl, age 22.

72
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:29,890
Mild natured?"

73
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:31,550
Mild natured? Meenakshi?

74
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:37,800
Mild natured. Maybe they meant nuts.

75
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:39,180
"Homely.

76
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:43,220
She has all the qualities
of an ideal Indian wife.

77
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:53,390
A complete Balaji brand
Hindi serial daughter-in-law.

78
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:58,600
An expert cook.
Respects her elders.

79
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:00,550
Loves children.

80
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,890
Very religious and prays every day."

81
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:16,260
All this is about Meenakshi?

82
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,430
What the...

83
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:21,350
You call this a matrimonial ad?

84
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:23,720
Which fool wrote all this?

85
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:25,100
I did.

86
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,800
I wrote all this.

87
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:29,970
Modern age, modern ad.

88
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:31,800
Just watch.

89
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:33,800
Soon handsome, rich youngsters

90
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:35,970
will flock to this neighborhood.

91
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:40,390
Goddess, for the first time

92
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:43,510
someone's name from this family

93
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,850
has appeared in the newspaper

94
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:47,510
and has spread far and wide.

95
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,050
Meenakshi!

96
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,930
Meenakshi!

97
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:22,470
Listen up

98
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,720
I've watched it all in films

99
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,800
The story of life

100
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:37,720
Bachchan's always in front of trees

101
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:42,890
And Rekha behind them

102
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:47,390
I'm no ordinary girl

103
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:49,510
My imagination runs wild

104
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,970
I charged my boring world

105
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:56,760
With zest of my dreams

106
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,800
My shot's ready, Lord

107
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:03,890
Make it okay

108
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:07,430
Fulfill my dreams

109
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:14,680
Make me a heroine
I'll offer a dollar in return

110
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:18,600
Make her a heroine
She'll offer a dollar in return

111
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:23,050
Make me a heroine
I'll offer a dollar in return

112
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:25,140
Let's go, dear
Sing a song

113
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:27,300
With the camera in tow

114
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:29,300
The frame's all set

115
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:30,850
Show them your true color

116
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,260
I want my colorful posters

117
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:00,350
To be seen in every neighborhood

118
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:04,140
Every radio station plays only my songs

119
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,260
Saw her story?

120
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:08,300
Her movie was pirated

121
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:12,180
Madhuri came to her premier

122
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:14,970
I want everyone to be my fan

123
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:16,850
They'd all want my autographs

124
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:21,510
Everyone begs
To take a picture with me

125
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:27,510
Make my beautiful sway
A hit with everyone

126
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,430
Fulfill my dreams

127
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:38,140
Make me a heroine
I'll offer a dollar in return

128
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:42,010
Make her a heroine
She'll offer a dollar in return

129
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:46,220
Make me a heroine
I'll offer a dollar in return

130
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,640
Let's go, dear, sing a song

131
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,350
With the camera in tow

132
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:52,800
The frame's all set

133
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:54,640
Show them your true color

134
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:19,640
I will horde all the telly ads as well

135
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,430
I'll sell everything
From toothpaste to homes

136
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,550
She's become famous

137
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,470
She did the catwalk

138
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,930
And her parking lot
Has Sachin's Ferrari

139
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:36,010
I'll have an affair
With a top hero

140
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:40,350
Yet, I'll claim to be single

141
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:46,800
All I want is an Oscar
Along with a lot of Filmfares

142
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:51,220
Fulfill my wishes

143
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:57,470
Make me a heroine
I'll offer a dollar in return

144
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:01,390
Make her a heroine
She'll offer a dollar in return

145
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:05,600
Make me a heroine
I'll offer a dollar in return

146
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:09,760
Come, dear
Let's have a drink at a party

147
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:12,640
And have a cup of Koffee with Karan

148
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,180
With the King of Bollywood in tow

149
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,720
Hey! What happened? Where?

150
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:34,680
Hey!

151
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:36,300
Who's that?

152
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,300
Who's that?

153
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,800
Listen.

154
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:43,390
Take that someplace else.

155
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,640
Clear that garbage dump from here.

156
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,220
We didn't ask for a home delivery.

157
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:51,970
Dad, Nana.

158
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,430
Don't just sit there.

159
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:54,640
Run.

160
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,050
And bring him back.

161
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,600
Who is that?

162
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,140
Who is that?

163
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,680
Grandma.

164
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:06,640
My child.

165
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,800
Have a sweet.

166
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:09,680
Hello, listeners.

167
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:12,720
Welcome to All India Radio.

168
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:14,800
The Naughty Countdown.

169
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:20,800
Let's first listen to this song
from the movie Dev D.

170
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:25,140
The song's requested by Nana
and his four dogs from Pune.

171
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,100
He has dedicated this song
to his sister Meenakshi.

172
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:33,890
Meenakshi, who constantly hops
in and out of her dreams.

173
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:37,970
And we've to check where
she is at the moment.

174
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:40,140
The song's also dedicated
to his grandma

175
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:43,260
whose heart and mind
sparkle more brilliantly

176
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:44,850
than her gold dentures.

177
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:49,010
Also to his over-enthusiast mother

178
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,760
and over-dedicated father, Ganesh Rao.

179
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:55,550
So let's all listen to
Deshpande family's request

180
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,100

181
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:00,350
Emotional Atyaachar.

182
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,680
Mother-in-law.

183
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,850
We've two good news.

184
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:08,140
First, we've our own dustbin.

185
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:10,050
Our very own.

186
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,930
Now I'll throw out the
garbage from here.

187
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,220
Mother.

188
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,930
-What are you doing?
-Like this.

189
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:18,260
Mother. Something's burning.

190
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:20,260
Serve me breakfast,
I'm getting late.

191
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:22,010
I've to go for a job interview.

192
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,010
Wonder when I will get a job?

193
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,180
You won't go anywhere,
Meenakshi.

194
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:29,890
The only place you'll go
is your husband's home.

195
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,800
Mother. If the way to my
husband's home

196
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:34,600
is through this heap of garbage

197
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,050
then I'll never get married.

198
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,680
No one will come to see me here.

199
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,510
What will you tell them?

200
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:43,180
"The last house in the colony

201
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:46,970
right behind the big heap of garbage

202
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:50,100
And even if you manage
to cross that garbage

203
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,220
the smoke will certainly
choke you to death."

204
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:55,300
Why? The girl's father,
who smokes

205
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:57,930
not one, two or three
but four cigarettes in a row.

206
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:01,180
And one of the dogs at the gate
will tear your pants.

207
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:04,720
Thanks to the girl's over-smart,
10th failed useless Nana,

208
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,390
who can't endure the sorrows of dogs.

209
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:09,100
He searches high and low every night

210
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:11,430
and brings dogs home,
to give them refuge.

211
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:15,800
Chandi, Sona, Dilbar, Janemann.

212
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:22,180
There's no place for dogs
or dog lovers in this country.

213
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,510
Once I find a clean house,

214
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,140
I'll marry some smuggler or shooter

215
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,680
and run away from this madhouse.

216
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,100
Come on. Let's go.

217
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,760
We will all leave this country.

218
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,510
Oh my!

219
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,680
What a beautiful girl.

220
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,680
She's so smart.

221
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:41,970
Why will you marry
a sharp-shooter?

222
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,930
Oh, oh!

223
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:47,550
What a face!

224
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,550
Those eyes!

225
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,850
That smile.

226
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:55,550
The family's a bit eccentric.

227
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:57,550
But the girl's perfect.

228
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,970
Be back soon.

229
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,390
There are two coming today.

230
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:09,470
One at 6:00 and the other at 9:00.

231
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,720
Of course. Why not?

232
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,800
It's the Friday, first day, first show.

233
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:16,350
You must have sold the tickets in black.

234
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:20,100
-Dad, what are you doing?
-Hello.

235
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,510
-Why don't you throw away these phones?
-Hello.

236
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,720
-We've our own garbage dump now?
-Hello.

237
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:29,430
They came here for repairing in 1993.

238
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:31,510
-But no one came back for them.
-Hello.

239
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:34,390
Nana, give me the keys
to the scooter.

240
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:37,680
Nana, I'm getting late.
Give me the keys.

241
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:39,050
Please, Nana. Give it.

242
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:41,010
First apologize to Dilbar and Janemann.

243
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,220
-Don't act too smart!
-I won't give it.

244
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,390
Give me the keys.

245
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,600
-Useless, dog.
-I won't.

246
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,850
I won't give you the keys.

247
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,100
Why did you call me a dog?
Don't call me a dog.

248
00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:00,050
There's no petrol.

249
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,800
Janemann, did you see?

250
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:08,140
I know you were smiling.

251
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,220
It was funny.

252
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,260
I've petrol.

253
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:15,550
We'll fill up the scooter and go out.

254
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,800
Rickshaw!

255
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,720
Want some.

256
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:39,760
You want some powder.

257
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,350
What?

258
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:42,930
Do you need a touch-up?

259
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,680
Touch-up?

260
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,890
Hello, sir.

261
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:00,260
Sir, my certificates.

262
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,350
Meenakshi Deshpande.

263
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:07,180
What do you think?

264
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:13,010
Actually, I think of
many things.

265
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:17,180
But right now I think you
should give me this job.

266
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:21,720
-What color saris do you wear?
-Yellow.

267
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:26,510
If you buy a scooter,
what will be the color?

268
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:28,100
Yellow.

269
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:30,430
Which sweet do you like?

270
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:32,390
Sweetmeats. The round ones.

271
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:34,300
The expensive yellow sweetmeats of Pune.

272
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,800
So what...
What's your favorite color?

273
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:40,600
-Red.
-Fantastic.

274
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:43,890
-The job is yours.
-Really?

275
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:46,390
Go. Don't waste my time.

276
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:47,850
Step out of the office.

277
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,760
You will find stairs.
Climb up.

278
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,800
Enter the sixth door.

279
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:56,760
Someone's waiting for you up there.

280
00:18:58,050 --> 00:18:59,970
Someone's waiting for me, sir?

281
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,890
Who?

282
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,510
Go. Don't waste my time.

283
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:01,010
Hi, I am Mynah.

284
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:02,720
And you?

285
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:05,260
Meenakshi.

286
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:10,550
What was all that?

287
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:14,260
I couldn't attend my Bollywood dance class

288
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:16,640
so I was rehearsing.

289
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:27,600
So you're the next one.

290
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:30,930
Next one?

291
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:36,050
Yes, wonder why these stupid girls
leave this job.

292
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,510
This place has such a nice
working ambiance, right?

293
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,430
Yes.

294
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,550
What will be my job?

295
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,430
Will you explain me my job?

296
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:51,720
I know everything about computers.

297
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:55,100
Word, Excel. Office.
Tally, I can operate all that.

298
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,640
Why are the computer models so old?

299
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:01,720
Oh no! What's that?

300
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:03,430
That's my water-bag.

301
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:04,550
His name's Jumbo.

302
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,720
Jumbo, Jumbo, say hello.

303
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,930
Hello, Jumbo.

304
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,550
Now tell me about my job.

305
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,470
Chill.

306
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:15,760
It's your first day.

307
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:18,430
The college starts a week later.

308
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:19,890
There's nothing to do right now.

309
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:24,640
I've a lot of unreleased films
on my pen drive.

310
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,680
My neighbor works for
the censor board.

311
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:30,180
Let us watch all the films.

312
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:34,390
Look, Mynah, just tell me about my job.

313
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,220
I don't want to see any
unreleased films.

314
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:40,180
And anyway,
my life's filled with drama.

315
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:41,600
I don't want anymore.

316
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,220
Where's the stench coming from?

317
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,600
I don't know.

318
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:21,390
Oh my!

319
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:22,510
What are you doing?

320
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:25,180
I know I can't touch him

321
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,010
but at least I can get
a good look at him.

322
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,640
That's John. John's my life.

323
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,470
John's only mine.

324
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,600
His body, his mind
are just for me.

325
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,640
Look, Meenakshi.

326
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:41,720
Look at his body,
look at his muscles.

327
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:44,300
Any...

328
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:49,140
Any lower
and it would've ruined the beauty.

329
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:51,550
But he's John.

330
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:56,050
And he knows when and how much
to expose.

331
00:22:56,890 --> 00:22:58,850
John! John! John! John! John! John!

332
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:02,550
-Mynah.
-John! John! John! John! John!

333
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:05,550
Look, Mynah.

334
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:10,100
This job...
is really important for me.

335
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:12,930
I've come here to work.

336
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:17,100
I want to earn a living.

337
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:20,470
And buy myself some freedom with it.

338
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:24,890
Maybe a rent a small room

339
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:28,930
where I can read books
and hear songs on the radio.

340
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:32,100
Why? Won't you get married?

341
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:35,430
I fear that I might get hitched soon.

342
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:38,930
There was an ad in the newspaper

343
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,800
and the prospective boys
are coming from today.

344
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:44,260
One at 6:00 and the other at 9:00.

345
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:46,850
Is this the way to get married?

346
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:51,760
Marriage follows only after love.

347
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:54,390
First, I want to fall in love.

348
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,390
Wow. You mean love marriage.

349
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,640
Such a cruel world.

350
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:03,050
They don't let me live in reality

351
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,760
or stay in my dreams.

352
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:08,430
You know, I always wander into my dreams.

353
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:10,890
I sing and dance there.

354
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:12,550
That places makes me really happy.

355
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:14,180
Dance with whom?

356
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:16,510
I am all alone in my dreams.

357
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:21,760
My dream world is completely clean.

358
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:27,470
It's fragrant,
has empty spaces

359
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:29,720
where the sun's rays fall.

360
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:32,550
Foreign locations or Indian?

361
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:34,720
Don't interrupt me, Mynah.
Don't interrupt.

362
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,600
Listen.

363
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,930
I didn't demand too much from life.

364
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,890
I still don't.

365
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:44,550
I want someone all to myself.

366
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,850
And when we fall in love

367
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:50,350
he'll say "Meenakshi, let's
run away and get married".

368
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:53,470
And then I'd steal all the jewels
from my home

369
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:55,850
and take the late-night passenger train.

370
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:57,640
Far away, far, far away.

371
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,680
Where the Maharashtrian police
never find us.

372
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:05,720
See. I have a small dream.

373
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:13,640
But girls like me have to struggle
to fulfill their dreams.

374
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:18,430
First with herself,
then with her parents

375
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,720
and then the guardian of this society.

376
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:26,510
But this evening I'm going
to face the reality of life.

377
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,640
Face the reality of life.

378
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:31,430
I never did it.

379
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:33,800
-How will you do it?
-Like this.

380
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,930
She makes really tasty beaten rice dish.

381
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:29,850
And you just can't resist the yogurt.

382
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:33,970
Oh my! Oh, God!

383
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:47,800
Oh my! Oh, God!

384
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,300
We'll give her 30 grams of gold.

385
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:00,050
And Meenakshi's grandma's gold dentures

386
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:02,350
has already been willed in her name.

387
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,510
I have ten daughters.

388
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:10,760
And Bablu's my only son.

389
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:21,760
My mother-in-law
and her mother-in-law's still alive.

390
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:25,930
Will you give me a facial after
we get married?

391
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:27,220
Are you vegetarian or non-vegetarian?

392
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:31,550
Will your daughter manage to stay happy
in this small family?

393
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:34,760
Oh my! Oh, God!

394
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:50,180
So? Did anyone come by?

395
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:52,510
No!

396
00:27:56,930 --> 00:28:00,600
Lord, your glory

397
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:06,390
The beautiful sky
The beautiful light

398
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:09,550
She makes really tasty beaten rice dish.

399
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:15,510
And you just can't resist the yogurt.

400
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:19,260
She makes really tasty beaten rice dish.

401
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:25,430
And you just can't resist the yogurt.

402
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:39,850
Come on, Pinky. Hurry up.

403
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:42,100
Stand in a line.
Stand in a line.

404
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:43,470
Come on.

405
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:46,510
-Did you breakup?
-No.

406
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,100
-You didn't break up, did you?
-Madam.

407
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,850
The registrar's run out of
drinking water.

408
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:54,180
He's asked for Jumbo.

409
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:57,680
Jumbo!

410
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,680
Here.

411
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:02,890
Go, Jumbo. Come back soon.
Go on.

412
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:08,300
Why did he take your water-bag?

413
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:11,220
The water cooler's
right outside his office.

414
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:13,010
Jumbo's everyone's favorite.

415
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:15,180
Someday he'll be your favorite, too.

416
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:24,180
Rascals, get out of here.

417
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:26,760
Wonder where they all come from
to learn Arts.

418
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,350
Get going.

419
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:30,140
Ma'am, give us our I-card.

420
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:31,890
-Get lost.
-We've been standing for so long.

421
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:33,760
Runaway, you'll get your I-cards
after four o'clock.

422
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:35,470
What I-card?

423
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:38,640
Get out. Get lost.
Get going.

424
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:42,180
I-card. I-card.

425
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:46,180
I'm slightly hungry.

426
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:49,600
I'm off to the canteen.
After that I've to dance as well.

427
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,850
Are you coming?

428
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:52,850
-Go ahead, I will join you.
-Okay.

429
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,390
I am Surya.

430
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:24,800
Surya Iyer.

431
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:26,100
My I-card.

432
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,300
My I-card, please.

433
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,100
Oh my.

434
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:48,760
Thank you.

435
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:25,140
I am hungry.

436
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:28,970
If he fails again
I'll jump into the well.

437
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:30,850
First give me something to eat.

438
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:43,100
Surya Iyer.

439
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:40,390
There's a sweet story in the air

440
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:50,010
Trying to convey itself
Through the breeze

441
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:57,550
The state of my heart
Like the petals of flowers

442
00:33:57,970 --> 00:34:02,100
The ambiance is fresh like dawn

443
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:06,800
The glittering stars in the day

444
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:11,390
All shining brightly upon you

445
00:34:11,470 --> 00:34:14,640
See them if you can

446
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:23,470
There's a sweet story in the air

447
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,640
Stop going to the office.

448
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:34,600
You've tanned traveling under the sun.

449
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:37,470
And you don't have a clue about
what you should do.

450
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,430
Make the bread properly.
Do it properly.

451
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:41,850
What is this? Smear some oil.
Smear some more oil.

452
00:34:42,430 --> 00:34:44,390
You can't even knead the dough properly

453
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:46,930
and you're so keen about
working on the computer.

454
00:34:47,930 --> 00:34:49,260
And you.

455
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:51,720
Do you have to smoke while eating?

456
00:34:52,430 --> 00:34:54,600
Yes, yes I do.

457
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,300
Mother.

458
00:34:56,390 --> 00:35:00,680
All those who came to see me,
I didn't like any of them.

459
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:04,300
Please stop putting me
on display every day.

460
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,430
Where do you get these nerds from?

461
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:10,260
Why? Are you expecting someone
rich and handsome?

462
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:12,050
Soon enough.

463
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:15,930
Destiny will bring the one to me.

464
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:19,430
These daily tea and snack programs
won't help.

465
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:24,550
That must be the rich and handsome.

466
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,390
Hello.

467
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:38,850
Remember that boy who came
to see you in the evening.

468
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:40,100
Must be his rejection call.

469
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:42,300
-I am sure.
-Nana.

470
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:44,550
Yes, yes.

471
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:48,180
I've always heard father saying
"Yes, yes."

472
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:49,550
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

473
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,430
I never understand what he's saying.

474
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:54,260
Remember the Kulkarnis who
visited us day before yesterday?

475
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:55,720
It must be them.

476
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:58,390
Last night I dreamt about Goddess.

477
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:01,220
And she gave me a yellow colored flower.

478
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:05,760
Mother. What's the yellow flower
got to do with Kulkarni's son?

479
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:08,680
And anyway, I found him a big bore.

480
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:10,430
First of all, he's too fair.

481
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:14,800
And I don't like boys who wear
a vest under their shirt.

482
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:16,470
They look just like dentists.

483
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,220
Do you stand there and observe

484
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:22,260
whether the boy's wearing
a vest inside or not?

485
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:26,010
Is a man judged by the vest he's wearing?

486
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:30,350
No, he's judged by another place.

487
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:31,720
Nana. Shameless.

488
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,100
What happened?

489
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:36,970
It was Mr. Kulkarni.

490
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:39,850
Didn't I say it must be them?

491
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:41,100
What happened?

492
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:43,390
When are they coming?
Or shall we go visit them?

493
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:44,640
No.

494
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:47,600
Their demands were too high, Savitri.

495
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:49,390
This alliance isn't possible.

496
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:51,390
It's beyond our budget.

497
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:54,350
Oh, wow! Perfectly round bread.

498
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,100
Here, Nana. Have a ball.

499
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:03,010
Look from here. See...

500
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:26,930
There's a sweet story in the air

501
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,470
Trying to...

502
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:53,220
The state of my heart
Like the petals of flowers

503
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:57,600
The ambiance is fresh like dawn

504
00:37:58,430 --> 00:37:59,470
The glittering...

505
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:26,100
As soon as the drops of colors fell

506
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:33,680
On the blank canvas of my dreams,
An entertaining celebration began

507
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:36,220
Yes, it began

508
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:42,800
And all the lonely paths
That were there

509
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:52,100
Are now swarmed with feelings

510
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:55,260
Yes, it is

511
00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:59,430
Let's walk this mile

512
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:04,720
It's the abode of my dreams

513
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:09,510
Even though I mustered
The will to some sleep

514
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:13,260
It still revolves around you

515
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:16,800
Weave them into one

516
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:26,430
There's a sweet story in the air

517
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:35,430
Trying to convey itself
Through the breeze

518
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,640
The sweet

519
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:42,760
Story

520
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,800
Conveys

521
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:55,100
Through the breeze

522
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:00,010
The sweet

523
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:02,260
Story

524
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:06,430
Conveys

525
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:13,760
Through the breeze

526
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,220
Surya.

527
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:28,970
Surya.
Surya, get up and have some tea.

528
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:32,970
What this? Get lost!

529
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:34,300
Surya.

530
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:38,970
Let me sleep. This is my time to sleep.
Why did you bring tea at this hour?

531
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:41,140
Surya, did you eat last night?

532
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:44,390
I've brought biscuits for you.

533
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:48,720
Pakda Pandi, are you stupid?

534
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,640
Get me bun omelet.

535
00:40:58,470 --> 00:40:59,930
Are the vegetables fresh?

536
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,010
Oh my!

537
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,640
Hi!

538
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:23,890
Surya.

539
00:41:25,970 --> 00:41:27,010
Good morning.

540
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:34,390
Hey!

541
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:52,890
Mom.

542
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:55,140
What?
What happened?

543
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:57,970
Mom. Mom, let's go.

544
00:41:58,260 --> 00:41:59,300
-What happened?
-Let's go.

545
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:00,930
Just take me away from here.

546
00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:02,300
-Yes, but--
-Let's go, Mom.

547
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:03,930
-But--
-Let's go, Mom.

548
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,140
I'm feeling dizzy.

549
00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:07,550
Let's go, Mom.

550
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:27,220
You work too hard, Meenakshi.

551
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:28,930
Don't work too hard

552
00:42:29,010 --> 00:42:31,640
and raise the standards of working.

553
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:35,050
It'll be really difficult
for girls like me.

554
00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:38,600
I...

555
00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:44,050
Remember, Mynah,
I told you about my dreams.

556
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:45,760
Yes. You did.

557
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:53,890
I... The principal has
asked for some details.

558
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:56,260
-About Surya.
-Surya?

559
00:42:56,930 --> 00:42:58,300
That drunk from Madras.

560
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:01,260
What's there to see in his records?

561
00:43:01,350 --> 00:43:03,600
He's a fishy guy.

562
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:06,800
He drinks all night, Meenakshi.

563
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:09,140
Have you seen his eyes?

564
00:43:09,850 --> 00:43:10,930
Red.

565
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:14,010
They say he had a rich father.

566
00:43:14,470 --> 00:43:16,760
He squandered his father's wealth
on drinking.

567
00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:18,800
What are you saying, Mynah?

568
00:43:19,350 --> 00:43:22,220
It says here he's received a Fellowship
from the Central Government

569
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:24,140
because he's an outstanding student.

570
00:43:24,390 --> 00:43:26,350
Mynah, don't lie.

571
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:30,010
I am not crazy to say all this.

572
00:43:30,350 --> 00:43:32,760
Meenakshi, I am not talking shit.

573
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:36,720
The Fellowships are rigged.

574
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,720
Fellowships won't make a difference.

575
00:43:40,470 --> 00:43:44,970
Like I said, his father
died repaying his debts.

576
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:48,890
-Yet, this boy I tell you--
-Really?

577
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:04,970
That... student in our college...

578
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:09,140
You were talking to him yesterday.

579
00:44:11,010 --> 00:44:12,050
Surya.

580
00:44:12,390 --> 00:44:13,510
Yes, what about him?

581
00:44:14,890 --> 00:44:16,470
What were you two talking about?

582
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:18,680
What do you know about him?

583
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:20,300
I don't know anything about anyone.

584
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:22,010
Go away. Don't talk to me.

585
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:24,970
People waste my time
and I've to bear the brunt.

586
00:44:41,850 --> 00:44:45,600
I've heard that
if these people don't drink,

587
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:47,640
their career never takes off.

588
00:44:48,430 --> 00:44:50,680
Everyone has to resort
to this kind of nonsense

589
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:52,140
to sell their painting.

590
00:44:52,970 --> 00:44:55,350
God! Is that really true?

591
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,300
Pakkad Pandi.
Get me a cup of tea.

592
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:14,510
Pakkad Pandi.
There are two chocolate bars on the table.

593
00:45:14,930 --> 00:45:17,970
One's for speaking up.

594
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:21,390
And the others for keeping mum.

595
00:45:23,350 --> 00:45:25,800
What do I say, sister?
You won't be able to hear it.

596
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:28,140
I will hear everything.
Tell me.

597
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:31,890
-Surya does drugs.
-What?

598
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:33,890
You know what drugs are?

599
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:36,050
How old are you?

600
00:45:36,390 --> 00:45:37,890
What do you know about drugs?

601
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:40,050
He's always on drugs

602
00:45:40,390 --> 00:45:42,850
to get into his world of imagination.

603
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:44,470
Oh, God.

604
00:45:45,010 --> 00:45:47,050
But I do that without them.

605
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:08,510
These artists have
a very controversial life.

606
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:11,600
I've heard such stories.
Which one do I tell you?

607
00:46:15,350 --> 00:46:16,390
Surya.

608
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:20,970
That's why Surya sees all that,
you and I cannot see.

609
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:22,550
I didn't get you.

610
00:46:22,890 --> 00:46:23,930
What can he see?

611
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:27,050
Surya sees things differently.

612
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:29,600
That's why he wins a gold medal.

613
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:31,220
No, no, no.

614
00:46:32,050 --> 00:46:34,300
The drugs are just rumors.

615
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:36,390
I don't believe it.

616
00:46:36,470 --> 00:46:38,470
I can't believe Surya does drugs.

617
00:46:54,550 --> 00:46:56,010
Let's talk about you.

618
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:58,180
Jumbo's sitting on your table.

619
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:02,390
Jumbo? The red water bag.
Mynah's?

620
00:47:02,470 --> 00:47:05,300
-What about it?
-Don't you know?

621
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:08,300
Mynah's the real culprit.

622
00:47:08,470 --> 00:47:10,510
She fills it with Vodka every morning.

623
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:15,220
I wonder how Surya's been winning
the gold medal

624
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:16,970
for the last two years.

625
00:47:18,430 --> 00:47:20,550
He must have a high connection.

626
00:47:21,390 --> 00:47:25,140
Only his paintings are sent to Delhi
for the Academic exhibition.

627
00:47:25,430 --> 00:47:27,140
Connections, again.

628
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:30,100
That's the reason
he's still in the college.

629
00:47:30,390 --> 00:47:33,180
Otherwise, there's no reason
to keep this animal here.

630
00:47:33,970 --> 00:47:39,220
The way he looks,
I don't like him at all.

631
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:07,760
Pakda Pandi, are you stupid?

632
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:09,760
Stop doing this every night.

633
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:11,760
Eat on time, sleep on time.

634
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:14,640
If you continue like this
someday you will die.

635
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:17,350
Listen, Pakkad Pandi,

636
00:48:17,850 --> 00:48:21,350
I need your help.

637
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:22,930
Just name it, sister.

638
00:48:23,010 --> 00:48:26,350
I am always ready to help
damsels in distress.

639
00:48:26,430 --> 00:48:28,050
My sweet child.
Listen.

640
00:48:35,890 --> 00:48:37,850
Wow. Wow.

641
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:45,800
One, two, three, four, five, six.

642
00:48:46,550 --> 00:48:47,640
One...

643
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:48,760
Wow.

644
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:59,800
One, two, three, four...

645
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:04,510
I like love triangles.

646
00:49:12,260 --> 00:49:15,550
Ask him what's libido in Tamil?

647
00:49:16,050 --> 00:49:18,050
Mynah, stay quiet.

648
00:49:21,390 --> 00:49:24,220
I like dark people not fair ones.

649
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:26,010
Teach me to say that.

650
00:49:27,430 --> 00:49:29,850
I like dark people not fair ones.

651
00:49:31,430 --> 00:49:37,350
I like people...

652
00:49:37,850 --> 00:49:40,140
No, no. Karappa means cockroach.

653
00:49:40,930 --> 00:49:42,430
Karp means dark.

654
00:49:43,350 --> 00:49:45,930
Madam, you forget so soon.

655
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:48,640
Okay, fine.

656
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:51,470
Okay, how do I say this,

657
00:49:52,220 --> 00:49:55,640
"Give me love, and I'll give
you rice-cakes and pancakes".

658
00:49:56,850 --> 00:50:00,260
Give me love, and I'll give
you rice-cakes and pancakes.

659
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:11,550
Give me love, and I'll give
you rice-cakes and pancakes.

660
00:50:11,850 --> 00:50:13,600
Super-duper correct.

661
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:15,930
Now, here's a suggestion.

662
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:19,220
Watch Tamil channels the entire night.

663
00:50:19,390 --> 00:50:20,760
Midnight Masala.

664
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:22,890
You'll learn Tamil in a jiffy.

665
00:50:22,970 --> 00:50:25,260
Oh my! I can certainly do that.

666
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,510
Here you go.

667
00:50:29,430 --> 00:50:30,890
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

668
00:50:58,470 --> 00:50:59,680
Sweetheart!

669
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:01,550
Sweetheart!

670
00:51:02,010 --> 00:51:04,680
Sweetheart!

671
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:08,300
As you stretched your body passionately

672
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:11,930
Made me realize once again

673
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:17,470
I finally say this today

674
00:51:18,010 --> 00:51:19,010
Books.

675
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:33,390
Please sign here.

676
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:41,100
Thanks.

677
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:44,550
Feel free to come!

678
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:46,850
I love you

679
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:48,430
Love you!

680
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:52,220
"I do not want you to shave.

681
00:51:53,010 --> 00:51:54,890
I do not want you to shave."

682
00:51:56,550 --> 00:51:57,720
I do not want you to shave.

683
00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:01,390
"You look handsome."

684
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:03,640
You look handsome.

685
00:52:05,010 --> 00:52:07,890
You look handsome.

686
00:52:08,470 --> 00:52:11,850
"Please keep the first button
of your shirt open.

687
00:52:12,970 --> 00:52:16,970
Please keep the first button
of your shirt open."

688
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:20,470
Please keep the first button
of your shirt open.

689
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:22,970
Oh my!

690
00:52:35,970 --> 00:52:39,220
Time for audio, visual training.

691
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:40,930
Midnight Masala.

692
00:53:33,550 --> 00:53:34,800
Oh, God!

693
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:38,140
Oh, God!

694
00:53:51,350 --> 00:53:54,300
Wake up from a dream
In critical condition

695
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:00,640
Earth quivering below
Everything shaking up

696
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:06,850
Face to face
With the man of my dreams

697
00:54:06,930 --> 00:54:09,890
Top to base
Filled with passion

698
00:54:10,220 --> 00:54:13,350
Thighs thundering, down under

699
00:54:13,430 --> 00:54:16,300
Size matters, thinking, wondering

700
00:54:16,890 --> 00:54:18,300
Jumping

701
00:54:19,890 --> 00:54:21,470
Pumping

702
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:24,760
Throbbing

703
00:54:26,470 --> 00:54:27,600
Thumping

704
00:54:28,050 --> 00:54:29,350
One, two, three, four

705
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:03,050
Heart pounding

706
00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:04,600
Beating like drums

707
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:07,640
Love lust to double the fun
It's so stern

708
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:15,760
Body heating

709
00:55:15,850 --> 00:55:17,350
Feeling like hot seat

710
00:55:17,510 --> 00:55:20,510
Calling fire-brigade
But no difference

711
00:55:23,930 --> 00:55:26,850
Dwell in my heart
Same to same

712
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:30,100
Top to base
Filled with passion

713
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:33,390
Thighs thundering, down under

714
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:36,390
Size matters, thinking, wondering

715
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:38,600
Jumping

716
00:55:39,890 --> 00:55:41,550
Pumping

717
00:55:43,050 --> 00:55:44,760
Female

718
00:55:46,350 --> 00:55:47,800
Male

719
00:55:47,970 --> 00:55:49,390
One, two, three, four

720
00:57:21,430 --> 00:57:22,970
Nana.

721
00:57:23,890 --> 00:57:25,010
What is it?

722
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:26,470
You're still awake.

723
00:57:27,180 --> 00:57:29,010
What to do?

724
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:30,760
I just can't sleep.

725
00:57:30,850 --> 00:57:33,890
Even if I do, I can't dream.

726
00:57:34,930 --> 00:57:38,850
And if I don't dream,
there's no point in sleeping.

727
00:57:39,050 --> 00:57:41,600
True. True.

728
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:43,180
Want some.

729
00:57:45,350 --> 00:57:47,300
Nana. Tell me.

730
00:57:47,390 --> 00:57:48,760
I was saying...

731
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:50,930
That thing... that...

732
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:57,890
I mean, the thing that rich kids take
in parties before food.

733
00:57:58,430 --> 00:58:02,050
-Beer.
-Oh no, not beer.

734
00:58:03,010 --> 00:58:05,680
That thing people take which is against
the law and could getr arested.

735
00:58:06,050 --> 00:58:09,180
Yes... cocaine!

736
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:12,010
No. Not cocaine.

737
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:15,600
Drugs. Drugs.

738
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:18,100
They are all the same.

739
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:21,050
Drugs are a kind of cocaine.

740
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:23,350
What about it?

741
00:58:25,260 --> 00:58:31,390
Do drugs make your body smell better?

742
00:58:33,050 --> 00:58:35,100
Don't know. Maybe.

743
00:58:35,930 --> 00:58:39,350
Must be an expensive A+ grade drug.

744
00:58:39,970 --> 00:58:42,180
Yes, it's possible.

745
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:44,600
So where do you find these drugs?

746
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:45,930
Why?

747
00:58:46,010 --> 00:58:47,220
Just like that.

748
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:49,890
I'm reading that Tamil Pulp Fiction.

749
00:58:51,850 --> 00:58:54,430
They're holding a competition.

750
00:58:54,510 --> 00:58:58,180
Find the places in your city
where you can get drugs.

751
00:58:58,260 --> 00:59:00,470
Do you know where we can get drugs?

752
00:59:01,010 --> 00:59:02,350
I want to send them an answer.

753
00:59:02,930 --> 00:59:05,300
No. I don't know.

754
00:59:06,470 --> 00:59:09,470
Oh, yes. The river in our city.

755
00:59:09,550 --> 00:59:13,300
The last bridge over it,
near the crematorium.

756
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:18,100
Every night a man stands under it.

757
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:22,050
From 2:00 to 4:00.

758
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:25,220
A European man.

759
00:59:26,390 --> 00:59:30,050
He has these goods.

760
00:59:31,350 --> 00:59:34,140
I don't care about
humans anymore, Meenakshi.

761
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:37,800
They're a bunch of liars and thieves.

762
00:59:39,220 --> 00:59:40,850
That's fine.

763
00:59:40,930 --> 00:59:43,010
But what have you decided
about your future?

764
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:44,970
Are you going to study or not?

765
00:59:45,050 --> 00:59:47,600
You'll have to choose
a line of work as well.

766
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:50,680
Now this is my job, Meenakshi.
Just watch.

767
00:59:51,260 --> 00:59:55,140
I'm going to build a big home for dogs.

768
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:57,800
Dog House.

769
01:00:00,510 --> 01:00:04,720
It'll be 12 storeys high
and will have every amenity for dogs.

770
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:07,260
First, I'll be the sole proprietor.

771
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:09,970
Then, I'll make it Pvt. Ltd.

772
01:00:10,050 --> 01:00:11,390
I will give you shares as well.

773
01:00:11,470 --> 01:00:12,970
Just watch, Meenakshi.

774
01:00:13,050 --> 01:00:17,720
One day we'll have public issue
of our company.

775
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:22,640
Then London, Hong Kong, Paris.

776
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:25,220
We'll have branches everywhere.

777
01:00:30,930 --> 01:00:31,970
Look. Down there.

778
01:00:34,350 --> 01:00:36,050
Is he the one?

779
01:00:36,470 --> 01:00:38,640
Yes, I think he's the one.

780
01:00:39,550 --> 01:00:41,390
Selling drugs.

781
01:00:52,390 --> 01:00:54,600
Meenakshi, I'm right behind you.

782
01:00:54,890 --> 01:00:55,930
Come on.

783
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:31,180
Let's go home.

784
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:33,470
I'm feeling sleepy.

785
01:01:34,010 --> 01:01:39,050
If there's just one lake in the jungle,

786
01:01:40,140 --> 01:01:44,970
then all the animals must come here.

787
01:01:46,890 --> 01:01:48,430
Jungle?

788
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:51,720
-Animals?
-Yes.

789
01:01:52,970 --> 01:01:56,300
Now I'm really interested
in these animals.

790
01:01:56,930 --> 01:01:57,970
I see.

791
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:05,760
-Nana.
-What?

792
01:02:06,260 --> 01:02:07,930
How much money do you have?

793
01:02:08,850 --> 01:02:11,800
Around 100, 110. Why?

794
01:02:12,850 --> 01:02:14,350
I have 200.

795
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:16,100
Here. Go.

796
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:18,140
Go where?

797
01:02:18,430 --> 01:02:21,550
Go to that man
and buy drugs worth 300 bucks.

798
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:26,180
Ask him, whether he's got the A+,
aromatic one?

799
01:02:26,260 --> 01:02:27,300
Go on.

800
01:02:27,390 --> 01:02:29,430
Meenakshi, you've really lost your mind.

801
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:31,180
Have you lost it?

802
01:02:31,260 --> 01:02:33,260
Let's go. Let's go from here.

803
01:02:33,350 --> 01:02:35,850
It's not for me.

804
01:02:36,390 --> 01:02:39,300
I just want to smell it.

805
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:42,390
-Go on.
-No, I am not going anywhere.

806
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:44,260
Have you lost your mind?

807
01:02:44,350 --> 01:02:45,600
Let's go. Let's go from here.

808
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:47,050
Let's go home. Let's go home.

809
01:02:47,140 --> 01:02:50,430
Useless. You will issue public shares
of your company.

810
01:02:50,510 --> 01:02:52,850
Coward. Give me all your money.

811
01:02:52,930 --> 01:02:55,350
Give it, give it, give it, give it.

812
01:02:55,430 --> 01:02:57,890
Take it, take it, take it.

813
01:02:58,220 --> 01:03:00,430
I don't want this towel,
give me the money.

814
01:03:00,510 --> 01:03:01,890
Yes, yes. Take it, take it.

815
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:03,890
What's this? Loose change.

816
01:03:06,220 --> 01:03:07,930
Meenakshi.

817
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:10,350
Meenakshi.

818
01:03:14,180 --> 01:03:17,050
Hey, mister. How much for 300?

819
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:23,600
What? What do you want?

820
01:03:23,970 --> 01:03:27,470
Oh my! You speak Marathi Hindi. Good.

821
01:03:28,890 --> 01:03:30,510
Give me the goods worth 300.

822
01:03:30,930 --> 01:03:34,430
Get lost. Are you crazy?

823
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:36,100
Run away.

824
01:03:36,300 --> 01:03:39,930
Give me. Give me in 300.

825
01:03:42,010 --> 01:03:43,220
You want this.

826
01:03:44,970 --> 01:03:46,640
What are you doing?

827
01:03:47,100 --> 01:03:49,140
Is this the way to talk?

828
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:51,220
I only asked for drugs.

829
01:03:51,430 --> 01:03:52,800
I am not asking for liquor.

830
01:03:53,010 --> 01:03:54,970
-All the people--
-Run away from here.

831
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:56,970
Run!

832
01:03:57,140 --> 01:03:58,430
Run, Meenakshi!

833
01:03:58,510 --> 01:04:00,350
He's got a gun. Run!

834
01:04:00,510 --> 01:04:02,300
Meenakshi. He's got a gun.

835
01:04:02,430 --> 01:04:03,850
My money!

836
01:04:03,930 --> 01:04:05,470
-My money!
-Forget it. Let's go.

837
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:07,970
He's got a gun. Rotten idea!

838
01:04:10,430 --> 01:04:11,470
Oh my...

839
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:18,800
Meenakshi Ankalserya Mudduswami
Puttuparti Iyer.

840
01:04:21,390 --> 01:04:23,720
Meenakshi Surya Iyer.

841
01:04:26,050 --> 01:04:27,760
Meenakshi S.

842
01:04:30,550 --> 01:04:32,470
Meenakshi Deshpande Iyer.

843
01:04:36,010 --> 01:04:39,800
Dilbar. Tired of this show business
every evening.

844
01:04:40,180 --> 01:04:42,180
But what to do? You are lucky.

845
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:43,890
You want to get married,

846
01:04:43,970 --> 01:04:46,680
you go out on the road and bark, bark.

847
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:49,350
We human being, no such chance.

848
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:51,970
Look at me. Sari and all.

849
01:04:52,050 --> 01:04:53,390
You are here.

850
01:04:53,470 --> 01:04:54,510
I have to go.

851
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:58,260
But the dogs...

852
01:04:58,850 --> 01:05:02,260
They're harmless.
They just bark. Don't worry.

853
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:04,220
Come in. Come in.

854
01:05:04,470 --> 01:05:05,470
Here.

855
01:05:22,930 --> 01:05:24,010
Meenakshi.

856
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:31,300
This is Meenakshi.

857
01:05:32,140 --> 01:05:36,220
And Meenakshi,
this is Manav Rajadhyaksh.

858
01:05:36,430 --> 01:05:37,970
And they are his parents.

859
01:05:51,140 --> 01:05:53,510
Why... Why are you standing?

860
01:05:54,470 --> 01:05:55,850
Please, sit down.

861
01:06:04,180 --> 01:06:06,350
Look, there's no need to be so formal.

862
01:06:08,510 --> 01:06:10,140
Which college did you pass out of?

863
01:06:11,970 --> 01:06:14,720
Ferguson college.
I've done my BA.

864
01:06:15,390 --> 01:06:17,260
And she's also done that computer course.

865
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:19,680
She was a topper of her class.

866
01:06:20,260 --> 01:06:21,550
Please have some.

867
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:23,800
-She's prepared it.
-No thanks.

868
01:06:27,550 --> 01:06:29,140
By the way, what are your hobbies?

869
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:35,930
I like to read.
I like books.

870
01:06:36,350 --> 01:06:38,510
Novels, short stories...

871
01:06:39,350 --> 01:06:44,930
I'm not too keen about cooking.
But I cook daily meal good enough.

872
01:06:48,430 --> 01:06:49,850
What are your hobbies?

873
01:06:50,180 --> 01:06:53,510
Half shirt with no vest inside.
Half shirt with no vest inside.

874
01:06:55,430 --> 01:06:56,550
My mother.

875
01:06:57,220 --> 01:06:58,350
She's blind.

876
01:06:59,390 --> 01:07:01,260
Yet she has a good observation.

877
01:07:04,890 --> 01:07:05,970
Interesting.

878
01:07:16,550 --> 01:07:18,510
So what's your favorite novel?

879
01:07:18,970 --> 01:07:20,350
Alice in Wonderland.

880
01:07:22,510 --> 01:07:23,760
Alice in Wonderland.

881
01:07:24,350 --> 01:07:26,890
That's my favorite.
Have you read it?

882
01:07:26,970 --> 01:07:28,300
I've read it around 100 times.

883
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:31,220
Sometimes I feel it's my own story.

884
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:34,550
Of course I've read it. But just once.

885
01:07:35,260 --> 01:07:39,010
By the way, I'm not a keen reader.

886
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:41,680
I watch sports. Mostly football.

887
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:45,760
In school, Madhav
was the junior table tennis champion.

888
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:47,970
He's been to many places.

889
01:07:48,430 --> 01:07:50,510
Madhav, tell the places you've been to.

890
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:51,800
Tell them.

891
01:07:52,930 --> 01:07:58,510
Kolhapur, Kuala Lumpur, Cairo, Ghana,
Nigeria, Azharbhai Chawl.

892
01:07:58,890 --> 01:08:01,260
He likes hearing music as well.

893
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:02,760
And gardening.

894
01:08:02,930 --> 01:08:06,510
He's planted rose plants on our terrace.

895
01:08:07,100 --> 01:08:08,180
Look.

896
01:08:08,510 --> 01:08:09,510
Oh my!

897
01:08:15,550 --> 01:08:20,680
Look... I don't want to make this
too complicated.

898
01:08:23,050 --> 01:08:26,470
Let me tell you frankly what I feel.

899
01:08:31,970 --> 01:08:33,550
Actually...

900
01:08:35,890 --> 01:08:37,300
I mean...

901
01:08:41,010 --> 01:08:42,180
I accept this proposal.

902
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:48,140
Shall I sing a song for you?

903
01:08:49,220 --> 01:08:50,680
No.

904
01:08:51,140 --> 01:08:52,760
No, there's no need.

905
01:08:53,180 --> 01:08:54,600
Please.

906
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:57,300
Please, hear it. Please hear me sing.

907
01:08:58,470 --> 01:09:00,510
Small heart

908
01:09:01,050 --> 01:09:02,470
Small desires

909
01:09:03,220 --> 01:09:05,350
An innocent desire
In this fun-filled heart

910
01:09:05,890 --> 01:09:11,220
The desire to touch the stars
And moon

911
01:09:11,430 --> 01:09:17,640
The desire to fly in the open sky

912
01:09:18,050 --> 01:09:21,890
Small heart, small desires

913
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:26,180
An innocent desire
In this fun-filled heart

914
01:09:38,510 --> 01:09:40,760
I really liked your daughter.

915
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:43,640
Great. That's great.

916
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:47,010
Goddess, You're truly benevolent.

917
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:49,600
-Did you hear?
-Yes, yes.

918
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:53,510
Congratulations.

919
01:09:56,050 --> 01:09:57,050
Mother-in-law.

920
01:09:57,140 --> 01:09:58,550
-Mother-in-law.
-What is it, Savitri?

921
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:00,970
Meenakshi's marriage has been fixed.

922
01:10:01,050 --> 01:10:02,100
-Oh, God!
-Yes.

923
01:10:02,180 --> 01:10:04,640
-Really?
-Congratulations, son.

924
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:06,760
Mom. Mom.

925
01:10:06,970 --> 01:10:10,390
Can I speak with your daughter
for a minute?

926
01:10:11,300 --> 01:10:13,260
Of course, son. Why not?

927
01:10:13,350 --> 01:10:14,850
Now this is your home, too.

928
01:10:14,930 --> 01:10:16,760
Go, go to her bedroom.

929
01:10:17,430 --> 01:10:19,100
Go on.

930
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:25,050
What is it, mother?

931
01:10:25,140 --> 01:10:26,140
Coming.

932
01:10:26,220 --> 01:10:27,800
It's Madhav.

933
01:10:28,260 --> 01:10:30,220
Oh my! Touch-up.

934
01:10:40,550 --> 01:10:43,390
-It's me.
-Come in.

935
01:10:46,430 --> 01:10:47,800
Come in, please.

936
01:10:59,180 --> 01:11:03,720
Actually, back in my school days...

937
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:09,720
QSQT, MPK, DDLJ, HAHK...

938
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:12,010
I...

939
01:11:14,140 --> 01:11:18,010
All I said that I like this proposal

940
01:11:18,350 --> 01:11:20,350
because I really liked you.

941
01:11:24,970 --> 01:11:26,550
But do you...

942
01:11:27,050 --> 01:11:28,930
I mean, they never asked...

943
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:30,390
What happened? What are you doing?

944
01:11:30,470 --> 01:11:32,600
Nothing. Normal. Normal.

945
01:11:39,220 --> 01:11:44,390
Mrs. Dixit. Meenakshi's marriage
has been fixed.

946
01:11:44,890 --> 01:11:47,550
-It's been fixed.
-I liked your parents.

947
01:11:47,890 --> 01:11:49,100
Very simple they are.

948
01:11:49,300 --> 01:11:51,800
-Fifty-eight thousand!
-75,000!

949
01:11:52,100 --> 01:11:55,140
Please tell me. Do you like me?

950
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:04,350
You are really nice but... I...

951
01:12:04,430 --> 01:12:07,390
Look, you can clearly say
whatever you want to.

952
01:12:07,720 --> 01:12:10,800
No, he's the only child.

953
01:12:11,470 --> 01:12:15,890
We just met ten minutes ago so I...

954
01:12:16,350 --> 01:12:18,470
Take a chance... parents...

955
01:12:18,850 --> 01:12:21,010
I can understand. I can understand.

956
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:25,180
Look, I...

957
01:12:25,350 --> 01:12:27,760
Meenakshi, congrats!

958
01:12:27,850 --> 01:12:30,640
Madhav. Madhav, I am Nana.
Your brother-in-law.

959
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:33,680
Your engagement's been fixed.
We've even booked the hall.

960
01:12:33,850 --> 01:12:36,100
We've discussed everything
with your parents.

961
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:38,390
-Fifteen days?
-Come on, Nana.

962
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:39,970
Can't you wait for two months?

963
01:12:40,050 --> 01:12:41,760
The marriage is two months later.

964
01:12:41,850 --> 01:12:43,220
We've a request, son.

965
01:12:43,300 --> 01:12:47,510
It's not right to enter their room
without knocking.

966
01:12:48,180 --> 01:12:50,720
East or west, Madhav is the best!

967
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:54,050
No, it's nothing.

968
01:12:54,300 --> 01:12:56,930
-I am leaving.
-Okay, fine.

969
01:13:01,470 --> 01:13:02,550
Oh no.

970
01:13:03,720 --> 01:13:09,220
Twelve, 13, 14... 15!

971
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:17,760
Engagement.

972
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:21,430
Oh no!

973
01:14:31,890 --> 01:14:33,220
Hello, how are you?

974
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:35,140
-Will you come to the temple tomorrow?
-Yes.

975
01:14:36,550 --> 01:14:37,970
You didn't go to work today?

976
01:15:03,970 --> 01:15:06,470
Get up, it's 8:30.

977
01:15:07,140 --> 01:15:10,260
You will never be on time
for anything in your life.

978
01:15:17,220 --> 01:15:18,430
Surya.

979
01:15:18,510 --> 01:15:20,350
Surya, the cooking gas is over.

980
01:15:20,930 --> 01:15:22,890
Get up, go to the agency to book it.

981
01:15:25,300 --> 01:15:26,930
Surya.

982
01:15:36,470 --> 01:15:38,510
I am fed up with you.

983
01:15:39,470 --> 01:15:41,600
Surya, look at me.

984
01:15:42,510 --> 01:15:47,390
Surya, look at me, I am talking to you!

985
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:54,010
Look at you, you are never home.

986
01:15:54,510 --> 01:15:56,470
No sense of responsibility, nothing.

987
01:15:58,100 --> 01:16:01,390
How much do you expect
from me at this age?

988
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:07,600
Surya, this is not what your father
wanted our home to be like.

989
01:16:08,350 --> 01:16:12,220
He has worked hard for you, for me

990
01:16:12,760 --> 01:16:17,260
so that all of us can live happily
in this city.

991
01:16:17,890 --> 01:16:19,390
I have to work now.

992
01:16:19,970 --> 01:16:23,760
Why don't you leave that painting class
and decide something about your future?

993
01:16:25,640 --> 01:16:28,640
Same discussion every week.

994
01:16:29,390 --> 01:16:30,800
Water.

995
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:42,680
No point in talking to people like you.

996
01:16:43,470 --> 01:16:44,890
Now please leave some money for me.

997
01:16:44,970 --> 01:16:46,300
I need it for groceries.

998
01:17:03,470 --> 01:17:04,720
Oh God.

999
01:17:19,300 --> 01:17:22,510
Did you forget something?

1000
01:17:23,350 --> 01:17:25,180
You always forget things.

1001
01:17:28,550 --> 01:17:29,890
Hello, aunt.

1002
01:17:30,720 --> 01:17:33,680
Look, aunt. I've such beautiful saris.

1003
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:36,890
Mepakshi, Pochampalli,
Benaras, Kanjivaram.

1004
01:17:37,180 --> 01:17:39,140
Take a look. Such pretty saris.

1005
01:17:39,220 --> 01:17:41,510
And at half the rate. Half the rate.

1006
01:17:41,930 --> 01:17:43,260
Is this the time to buy saris?

1007
01:17:44,470 --> 01:17:45,890
I don't want your saris.

1008
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:48,180
Get lost.

1009
01:17:50,050 --> 01:17:53,010
Aunt. Aunt. Aunt.

1010
01:17:58,930 --> 01:18:01,050
You've a sad story, dear.

1011
01:18:02,220 --> 01:18:05,510
The things women have to do
to run their home.

1012
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:10,390
So, did your father never try to find you

1013
01:18:10,550 --> 01:18:13,010
after leaving you at the orphanage?

1014
01:18:16,390 --> 01:18:20,930
May God bless him...
wherever he is.

1015
01:18:23,100 --> 01:18:24,600
And you?

1016
01:18:24,680 --> 01:18:27,300
Your family, grandchildren.

1017
01:18:28,390 --> 01:18:31,390
I don't have any family or grandchildren.

1018
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:33,850
All I have is a son.

1019
01:18:34,510 --> 01:18:37,350
I wonder when he'll get married?

1020
01:18:39,640 --> 01:18:41,760
Wait here, I'll be right back.

1021
01:20:00,300 --> 01:20:01,600
Child.

1022
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:07,350
Where were you?

1023
01:20:07,430 --> 01:20:09,930
Here. Have some coffee before you leave.

1024
01:20:10,390 --> 01:20:12,140
You will like it.

1025
01:20:18,930 --> 01:20:21,430
Dear. Are you married?

1026
01:20:23,220 --> 01:20:24,300
No.

1027
01:20:27,220 --> 01:20:29,890
What type of daughter-in-law
are you looking for?

1028
01:20:30,350 --> 01:20:34,140
Who would be foolish enough
to give us their daughter?

1029
01:20:34,890 --> 01:20:38,680
We aren't what we were before.

1030
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:42,220
I wonder when and how
my son will get married.

1031
01:20:43,510 --> 01:20:48,010
I wonder if making paintings
will land him a job or not?

1032
01:20:48,470 --> 01:20:50,510
What are you saying, aunt?

1033
01:20:51,050 --> 01:20:55,600
These painters...
look just like Guru Dutt in college.

1034
01:20:56,390 --> 01:20:59,050
Cigarette in one hand, cruel world,

1035
01:20:59,180 --> 01:21:01,720
worn out old clothes, broken hearts.

1036
01:21:02,050 --> 01:21:05,010
And once they pass out,
they turn into Aamir Khan.

1037
01:21:07,850 --> 01:21:10,800
Surya will surely become Aamir Khan.

1038
01:21:10,890 --> 01:21:13,430
How do you know his name?

1039
01:21:13,550 --> 01:21:15,390
Where did you see his paintings?

1040
01:21:16,220 --> 01:21:17,800
Do you have water supply 24 hours a day?

1041
01:21:17,890 --> 01:21:19,800
How many children do you have?
How many rooms do you have?

1042
01:21:19,890 --> 01:21:22,680
Who cooks in your house?
Do you want dowry?

1043
01:21:22,760 --> 01:21:24,260
What type of daughter-in-law
are you looking for?

1044
01:21:24,350 --> 01:21:26,140
Modern daughter, who goes out and works

1045
01:21:26,220 --> 01:21:28,180
or the ones that sit at home,
like in television serials.

1046
01:21:28,260 --> 01:21:30,760
Do you stay here
or do you keep visiting Tamil Nadu?

1047
01:21:32,890 --> 01:21:34,720
Mom, open the door. Quick.

1048
01:21:34,930 --> 01:21:36,680
He's back. Must have forgotten something.

1049
01:21:43,050 --> 01:21:44,260
Move.

1050
01:22:31,850 --> 01:22:33,600
Mom, I'm getting late.

1051
01:22:40,260 --> 01:22:43,510
Ruthu, Come soon.
You have to go to school.

1052
01:23:13,300 --> 01:23:14,680
What?

1053
01:23:15,720 --> 01:23:17,100
Why are you waving?

1054
01:23:17,180 --> 01:23:18,220
Get lost.

1055
01:23:19,890 --> 01:23:22,470
Oh my! I was waiting for you.

1056
01:23:22,760 --> 01:23:23,800
I know.

1057
01:23:34,300 --> 01:23:36,800
By the way, what films do you like?

1058
01:23:37,890 --> 01:23:39,260
Meaning?

1059
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:43,430
I like what everyone else does.

1060
01:23:44,850 --> 01:23:46,930
-And you?
-Well...

1061
01:23:47,680 --> 01:23:50,680
I'm a bit old-fashioned
when it comes to films.

1062
01:23:51,010 --> 01:23:52,970
-Why?
-Don't know.

1063
01:23:53,260 --> 01:23:58,260
But violent, revenge stories,
I don't like these things.

1064
01:23:59,050 --> 01:24:01,350
Do you know who my favorite actors are?

1065
01:24:02,510 --> 01:24:05,390
Farooq Sheikh and Deepti Naval.

1066
01:24:06,140 --> 01:24:09,510
-Have you seen their films?
-No.

1067
01:24:10,010 --> 01:24:11,470
Who's Deepti Naval?

1068
01:24:11,970 --> 01:24:13,390
Deepti Naval!

1069
01:24:14,470 --> 01:24:16,430
Deepti Naval...

1070
01:24:16,640 --> 01:24:18,350
You must watch her films.

1071
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:19,760
I will show you.

1072
01:24:20,010 --> 01:24:24,600
I mean, we'll watch their films together.

1073
01:24:25,970 --> 01:24:28,390
Such amazing chemistry between them.

1074
01:24:28,470 --> 01:24:30,260
Oh, my God! Out of this world.

1075
01:24:30,890 --> 01:24:34,800
And that's my idea of an ideal romance.

1076
01:24:36,140 --> 01:24:38,760
Then I'll have to watch those movies.

1077
01:24:39,890 --> 01:24:42,390
-What did they do in the films?
-Nothing.

1078
01:24:44,510 --> 01:24:46,140
Nothing?

1079
01:24:48,470 --> 01:24:50,720
I mean, they were ordinary people.

1080
01:24:51,350 --> 01:24:52,970
Just like our neighbors.

1081
01:24:53,260 --> 01:24:56,850
No makeup or glossy designer clothes.

1082
01:24:57,640 --> 01:24:59,970
-They didn't wear designer clothes.
-Never.

1083
01:25:00,260 --> 01:25:01,930
What were they doing in films?

1084
01:25:06,350 --> 01:25:10,180
And there wasn't much singing and dancing
in their films.

1085
01:25:10,470 --> 01:25:11,550
No songs and dance?

1086
01:25:11,640 --> 01:25:13,600
They had songs.

1087
01:25:15,800 --> 01:25:19,430
They conveyed their expression this way.

1088
01:25:20,140 --> 01:25:22,800
-Through their eyes.
-Yes.

1089
01:25:24,430 --> 01:25:25,720
And Deepti Naval.

1090
01:25:26,390 --> 01:25:28,550
Deepti Naval! Oh, my God!

1091
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:44,050
Since I saw you
I realized

1092
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:52,260
Since I saw you
I realized

1093
01:25:53,680 --> 01:25:56,510
Life's blazing sun

1094
01:25:57,180 --> 01:26:00,510
And you're the cool shade

1095
01:26:03,510 --> 01:26:05,600
The heart...

1096
01:26:05,930 --> 01:26:09,800
Expressed a desire again

1097
01:26:10,470 --> 01:26:17,100
The heart expressed a desire again

1098
01:26:18,640 --> 01:26:25,390
Once again I explained my heart

1099
01:26:26,470 --> 01:26:33,390
Once again I explained my heart

1100
01:26:34,350 --> 01:26:41,050
Life's blazing sun
And you're the cool shade

1101
01:26:42,220 --> 01:26:48,680
Since I saw you
I realized

1102
01:27:01,850 --> 01:27:03,470
Meenakshi.

1103
01:27:05,640 --> 01:27:09,050
Are you always this quiet?

1104
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:13,680
No, it's not that.

1105
01:27:15,930 --> 01:27:18,760
I'm the only one talking since evening.

1106
01:27:24,050 --> 01:27:26,550
Fine. I'll leave.

1107
01:27:28,510 --> 01:27:31,470
Madhav. Thank you.

1108
01:27:33,470 --> 01:27:34,600
What for?

1109
01:27:37,350 --> 01:27:42,550
You're the first boy to ask what I wanted.

1110
01:27:43,510 --> 01:27:47,260
-What I felt. I...
-So?

1111
01:27:50,050 --> 01:27:52,800
I... actually...

1112
01:27:56,390 --> 01:27:59,430
No. It's nothing.

1113
01:28:01,260 --> 01:28:04,260
And thank you for singing that song.

1114
01:28:15,930 --> 01:28:18,350
Tell me! Tell me!

1115
01:28:18,470 --> 01:28:19,800
Mother-in-law.

1116
01:28:19,890 --> 01:28:22,390
Nandini's going to rise
from the dead today.

1117
01:28:23,100 --> 01:28:24,430
Meenakshi.

1118
01:28:24,510 --> 01:28:26,050
Meenakshi.

1119
01:28:40,890 --> 01:28:42,180
What is it, mother?

1120
01:28:42,260 --> 01:28:43,760
What did you two do?

1121
01:28:43,850 --> 01:28:45,140
Where did you go?

1122
01:28:45,220 --> 01:28:46,470
What did you two eat?

1123
01:28:47,890 --> 01:28:49,970
I swallowed two dozen sleeping pills.

1124
01:28:50,050 --> 01:28:52,800
And a bottle of Dettol.

1125
01:28:53,100 --> 01:28:54,890
And if I still don't die,

1126
01:28:54,970 --> 01:28:56,680
I'm going to jump in front
of the moving train tomorrow.

1127
01:28:56,760 --> 01:29:01,430
Or else set myself, you,
this house, neighbors on fire.

1128
01:29:01,510 --> 01:29:04,140
Or I'll turn into a witch
and cast a spell on everyone.

1129
01:29:04,220 --> 01:29:05,970
What's happening with my life?

1130
01:29:06,640 --> 01:29:08,890
Oh, God! She's so dramatic.

1131
01:29:09,430 --> 01:29:10,470
God.

1132
01:29:11,890 --> 01:29:15,010
Meenakshi,
you're going to get engaged soon.

1133
01:29:15,100 --> 01:29:17,260
And then marriage.

1134
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:20,640
-I need time to think.
-Fine, think.

1135
01:29:20,720 --> 01:29:22,760
Until then I'll boil the milk.

1136
01:29:23,260 --> 01:29:27,180
Mom, I need time to think about
the engagement.

1137
01:29:27,680 --> 01:29:30,680
You can think about it
even after your engagement.

1138
01:29:30,890 --> 01:29:32,600
What's the point in thinking about it now?

1139
01:29:32,680 --> 01:29:36,220
Right now, quit your job and get a facial.

1140
01:29:36,640 --> 01:29:38,760
Tomorrow we're visiting Madhav's place.

1141
01:29:39,180 --> 01:29:40,760
To see your home.

1142
01:29:40,850 --> 01:29:45,300
Which isn't yours yet
but soon it'll be.

1143
01:31:26,550 --> 01:31:27,850
Five feet four inches.

1144
01:31:29,300 --> 01:31:31,010
Five feet four inches.

1145
01:31:34,850 --> 01:31:36,260
Let me in.

1146
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:47,760
Actually, we're building a double bed
for Madhav and Meenakshi.

1147
01:31:48,970 --> 01:31:52,850
Madhav used to sleep alone
on a single bed until now.

1148
01:31:53,050 --> 01:31:54,220
And now...

1149
01:32:09,510 --> 01:32:10,970
Say your dialog.

1150
01:32:13,350 --> 01:32:14,720
Where is Madhav?

1151
01:32:14,800 --> 01:32:16,470
Shall I prepare tea and snacks?

1152
01:32:20,760 --> 01:32:22,430
Madhav.

1153
01:32:27,970 --> 01:32:29,930
There you are.

1154
01:32:31,510 --> 01:32:33,430
You're here.

1155
01:32:34,550 --> 01:32:37,760
Father. Why didn't you tell me?

1156
01:32:38,300 --> 01:32:39,720
Please be seated.

1157
01:32:40,180 --> 01:32:41,680
I'll just go change.

1158
01:32:43,970 --> 01:32:45,430
-Yes.
-Come.

1159
01:32:45,510 --> 01:32:47,220
Let's go.

1160
01:33:49,550 --> 01:33:50,600
Sandal one.

1161
01:33:50,680 --> 01:33:51,760
Sandal two.

1162
01:33:51,850 --> 01:33:54,300
Meenakshi, run.

1163
01:33:54,890 --> 01:33:56,100
I couldn't run.

1164
01:33:56,180 --> 01:33:57,550
Run. Run.

1165
01:33:57,640 --> 01:33:59,760
I couldn't run, but you run away.

1166
01:33:59,850 --> 01:34:01,010
Run. Run.

1167
01:34:01,100 --> 01:34:02,720
Run away, quickly.

1168
01:34:04,180 --> 01:34:05,680
Here.

1169
01:34:07,970 --> 01:34:09,510
Where is Meenakshi?

1170
01:34:10,600 --> 01:34:12,890
Meenakshi...
What do you mean?

1171
01:34:14,010 --> 01:34:15,550
She must be coming.

1172
01:34:16,050 --> 01:34:19,010
After freshening up,
straightening her lipstick.

1173
01:34:21,300 --> 01:34:23,390
No, no, Meenakshi isn't upstairs.

1174
01:34:23,510 --> 01:34:25,720
I thought she came down
with all of you.

1175
01:34:26,930 --> 01:34:31,300
Meenakshi is like an empty plastic bag.

1176
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:33,180
She's gone with the wind.

1177
01:34:34,850 --> 01:34:36,680
She's gone with the wind.

1178
01:36:26,010 --> 01:36:27,470
You came after a long time.

1179
01:36:27,550 --> 01:36:29,390
I've something for you.

1180
01:36:29,470 --> 01:36:30,760
Take it.

1181
01:36:30,850 --> 01:36:32,180
When do I come back for the rest?

1182
01:38:08,720 --> 01:38:13,600
What should I do?
Oh God!

1183
01:38:17,510 --> 01:38:22,510
Should I sigh?

1184
01:38:27,720 --> 01:38:31,720
Oh, my God

1185
01:38:32,300 --> 01:38:36,100
What should I do?

1186
01:38:36,430 --> 01:38:37,510
Every word you say

1187
01:38:38,390 --> 01:38:39,640
Resonates

1188
01:38:40,260 --> 01:38:43,640
Like melody in my ears

1189
01:38:44,010 --> 01:38:47,100
Like melody in my ears

1190
01:38:47,720 --> 01:38:48,850
My body's so helpless

1191
01:38:49,510 --> 01:38:50,640
I didn't listen to my heart

1192
01:38:51,390 --> 01:38:54,970
The heart says the body's a deceiver

1193
01:38:55,050 --> 01:38:58,850
The heart says the body's a deceiver

1194
01:39:00,550 --> 01:39:03,970
Oh God!
It creates a stir

1195
01:39:04,350 --> 01:39:07,510
Oh God!
It creates a stir

1196
01:39:08,050 --> 01:39:11,850
What's this passion in my heart?

1197
01:39:11,930 --> 01:39:15,300
There's an excitement in my heart

1198
01:39:15,640 --> 01:39:18,890
Oh God!
It creates a stir

1199
01:39:19,140 --> 01:39:22,850
Oh God!
It creates a stir

1200
01:39:23,800 --> 01:39:25,100
Oh my!

1201
01:39:25,600 --> 01:39:27,140
Oh my!

1202
01:39:27,470 --> 01:39:28,890
Oh my!

1203
01:39:29,430 --> 01:39:31,350
Oh my!

1204
01:40:00,300 --> 01:40:04,100
I borrowed few colors
From the fervor of youth

1205
01:40:04,180 --> 01:40:07,220
And filled my dreams with colors

1206
01:40:07,890 --> 01:40:11,010
I crossed every boundary

1207
01:40:11,550 --> 01:40:14,390
What's this desire fueling me?

1208
01:40:20,760 --> 01:40:24,390
Wherever I get the sweet scent
Of my beloved

1209
01:40:24,470 --> 01:40:27,800
My heart starts to sway

1210
01:40:28,180 --> 01:40:30,930
I raced out of the gardens

1211
01:40:31,850 --> 01:40:34,760
And ran after the bees

1212
01:40:34,850 --> 01:40:35,970
Bound to captivity

1213
01:40:36,680 --> 01:40:37,850
This poor prey

1214
01:40:38,600 --> 01:40:41,430
Locks eyes with her hunter

1215
01:40:42,260 --> 01:40:45,470
Locks eyes with her hunter

1216
01:40:45,970 --> 01:40:46,970
My body's so helpless

1217
01:40:47,800 --> 01:40:48,930
I didn't listen to my heart

1218
01:40:49,640 --> 01:40:52,300
The heart says the body's a deceiver

1219
01:40:53,390 --> 01:40:57,300
The heart says the body's a deceiver

1220
01:40:58,970 --> 01:41:02,140
Oh God!
It creates a stir

1221
01:41:02,640 --> 01:41:05,970
Oh God!
It creates a stir

1222
01:41:06,260 --> 01:41:09,850
What's this passion in my heart?

1223
01:41:10,050 --> 01:41:13,470
There's an excitement in my heart

1224
01:41:13,760 --> 01:41:16,930
Oh God!
It creates a stir

1225
01:41:17,470 --> 01:41:21,180
Oh God!
It creates a stir

1226
01:41:21,970 --> 01:41:23,010
Oh my!

1227
01:41:23,760 --> 01:41:25,260
Oh my!

1228
01:41:25,680 --> 01:41:26,930
Oh my!

1229
01:41:27,510 --> 01:41:28,890
Oh my!

1230
01:41:41,470 --> 01:41:44,050
What should I do?
Oh God!

1231
01:41:49,390 --> 01:41:52,430
Should I sigh?

1232
01:41:58,800 --> 01:42:02,850
Oh, my God

1233
01:42:03,390 --> 01:42:08,350
What should I do?

1234
01:42:21,300 --> 01:42:22,350
Meenakshi.

1235
01:42:26,180 --> 01:42:27,180
Meenakshi.

1236
01:42:43,010 --> 01:42:44,010
Come on.

1237
01:43:08,970 --> 01:43:10,350
Let's go, Meenakshi.
We're already late.

1238
01:43:10,430 --> 01:43:11,680
The show starts at six o'clock.

1239
01:43:14,640 --> 01:43:16,390
Meenakshi.

1240
01:43:16,470 --> 01:43:19,390
Hey, mister. What's going on?

1241
01:43:19,930 --> 01:43:21,800
Look, the office is closed.

1242
01:43:21,890 --> 01:43:23,050
We're not available.

1243
01:43:23,140 --> 01:43:25,350
And we don't want any vacuum cleaner
or water purifier.

1244
01:43:25,430 --> 01:43:27,640
No, no, I know her.
Meenakshi, please tell her.

1245
01:43:27,720 --> 01:43:29,970
Don't try to sell anything here.
You salesman. Get lost.

1246
01:43:48,100 --> 01:43:50,140
Can I talk to you please?

1247
01:43:51,470 --> 01:43:55,600
Can I talk to you please?

1248
01:44:03,140 --> 01:44:04,720
Madhav!

1249
01:44:06,300 --> 01:44:07,600
Madhav!

1250
01:44:25,850 --> 01:44:29,050
Comrades, charge ahead.
Come on.

1251
01:44:29,850 --> 01:44:34,140
Long live revolution!

1252
01:44:34,470 --> 01:44:36,720
Long live revolution!

1253
01:44:37,220 --> 01:44:39,850
Get to work. Sing songs.
Sing songs. Hurry up.

1254
01:44:50,800 --> 01:44:53,640
Come on, Meenakshi,
let's take you to the beauty parlor.

1255
01:44:53,720 --> 01:44:55,010
-What?
-Let's go.

1256
01:44:55,550 --> 01:44:56,930
What's going here?

1257
01:44:57,010 --> 01:44:58,760
And when did you all arrive?

1258
01:44:59,260 --> 01:45:01,600
I don't want to go to a beauty parlor.

1259
01:45:01,680 --> 01:45:03,180
Meenakshi.

1260
01:45:03,260 --> 01:45:05,390
-Mother.
-My Meenakshi.

1261
01:45:06,550 --> 01:45:08,100
Anju-Manju! Kamla-Vimla!

1262
01:45:08,180 --> 01:45:10,350
-Come on take her to the beauty parlor.
-Mother.

1263
01:45:11,300 --> 01:45:13,050
What are they all doing here?

1264
01:45:13,140 --> 01:45:15,180
Our home seems like a movie set!

1265
01:45:15,550 --> 01:45:16,600
What's today?

1266
01:45:20,350 --> 01:45:22,470
Today's your engagement, dear.

1267
01:45:23,640 --> 01:45:26,430
Madhav's coming with his relatives
in the evening.

1268
01:45:26,850 --> 01:45:28,100
Did you forget?

1269
01:45:28,180 --> 01:45:29,510
-What?
-Yes.

1270
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:31,010
-It's today?
-Yes.

1271
01:45:31,100 --> 01:45:33,010
Why didn't you tell me, mother?

1272
01:45:33,100 --> 01:45:34,800
This isn't something you forget.

1273
01:45:34,890 --> 01:45:37,050
Go and take a bath, quickly.

1274
01:45:37,390 --> 01:45:39,680
Let her get ready. Come on.

1275
01:45:39,760 --> 01:45:40,890
I completely forgot.

1276
01:46:33,050 --> 01:46:34,640
How are you, aunt?

1277
01:46:43,640 --> 01:46:45,300
Leave me!

1278
01:46:45,390 --> 01:46:49,720
Leave me! Leave me! Leave me! Leave me
you witch.

1279
01:46:49,800 --> 01:46:51,550
-I want to drink.
-No!

1280
01:46:51,640 --> 01:46:53,180
-Don't drink it!
-Leave me!

1281
01:46:53,300 --> 01:46:55,510
Leave me!

1282
01:46:58,850 --> 01:47:01,300
Please don't tell anyone, Mynah.

1283
01:47:02,850 --> 01:47:06,300
I thought before I get engaged

1284
01:47:06,430 --> 01:47:10,300
-I will... I will...
-What?

1285
01:47:12,260 --> 01:47:17,350
-Whenever he's around, I... I...
-What?

1286
01:47:17,430 --> 01:47:18,720
Nothing.

1287
01:47:21,300 --> 01:47:25,140
-What's your future husband's name?
-Madhav.

1288
01:47:26,350 --> 01:47:28,470
Madhav Rajadhyaksh.

1289
01:47:29,010 --> 01:47:30,680
He's too nice.

1290
01:47:31,350 --> 01:47:33,760
-But me...
-I am nice, too.

1291
01:47:34,140 --> 01:47:36,050
Being nice doesn't get you married.

1292
01:47:37,390 --> 01:47:39,680
Do you know everything about him?

1293
01:47:40,850 --> 01:47:42,050
Wait.

1294
01:47:43,300 --> 01:47:47,640
Meenakshi. He's pure husband material.

1295
01:47:49,260 --> 01:47:53,430
See. He grows roses on his terrace.

1296
01:47:54,260 --> 01:47:56,600
And no records of any girlfriend either.

1297
01:47:57,800 --> 01:48:00,890
Marry him. Forget all about Surya.

1298
01:48:01,890 --> 01:48:03,800
Maybe that's what I'm going to do.

1299
01:48:04,430 --> 01:48:06,050
That's what I I'll have to do.

1300
01:48:06,930 --> 01:48:08,600
That's life.

1301
01:48:09,800 --> 01:48:13,260
Fall in love with one
and marry another.

1302
01:48:14,180 --> 01:48:18,180
Meenakshi, don't cry.

1303
01:48:18,390 --> 01:48:19,970
Don't cry.

1304
01:48:20,050 --> 01:48:22,300
Marry this Madhav.

1305
01:48:22,930 --> 01:48:24,800
Stay with him for a few years.

1306
01:48:25,760 --> 01:48:27,890
And keep a watch on Surya online.

1307
01:48:28,100 --> 01:48:30,180
How much does his painting sell for?

1308
01:48:30,260 --> 01:48:32,220
What's his social circle?

1309
01:48:32,300 --> 01:48:34,390
What do the critics say about him?

1310
01:48:35,180 --> 01:48:37,180
Keep an eye on everything.

1311
01:48:37,970 --> 01:48:41,260
And if you see him getting famous,

1312
01:48:41,350 --> 01:48:44,260
then you can have an affair with him.
No one's stopping you.

1313
01:48:44,850 --> 01:48:47,100
After all love is not everything, baby.

1314
01:48:47,390 --> 01:48:48,890
We don't need love and all.

1315
01:49:06,930 --> 01:49:09,470
Oh, beloved

1316
01:49:10,140 --> 01:49:13,260
I'm your sweetheart

1317
01:49:13,760 --> 01:49:16,220
I swallowed my tears

1318
01:49:17,050 --> 01:49:19,350
Wonder how I lived like this

1319
01:49:20,220 --> 01:49:22,930
What's my helplessness?

1320
01:49:23,600 --> 01:49:26,180
How do I tell you what happened

1321
01:51:19,180 --> 01:51:21,100
Welcome.

1322
01:52:33,800 --> 01:52:35,470
Are all the arrangements done?

1323
01:52:35,550 --> 01:52:37,260
Yes, Nana, it's all done.

1324
01:52:37,350 --> 01:52:40,470
-Except for one thing.
-What's that, Nana?

1325
01:52:40,550 --> 01:52:41,760
Meenakshi.

1326
01:52:41,850 --> 01:52:43,970
Meenakshi's missing.

1327
01:52:44,390 --> 01:52:45,680
She must be somewhere around.

1328
01:52:45,760 --> 01:52:47,430
No, she isn't anywhere around.

1329
01:52:48,430 --> 01:52:49,930
-What?
-Yes.

1330
01:52:50,350 --> 01:52:51,720
Yes.

1331
01:52:52,050 --> 01:52:53,430
Oh, God.

1332
01:52:54,010 --> 01:52:56,600
I was busy with the preparations
the entire day.

1333
01:52:56,680 --> 01:52:58,640
I thought she's gone
to the beauty parlor.

1334
01:52:59,550 --> 01:53:02,050
Goddess. What to do?

1335
01:53:03,180 --> 01:53:04,390
Cigarette.

1336
01:53:04,470 --> 01:53:05,890
I need a cigarette.

1337
01:53:05,970 --> 01:53:07,140
Cigarette.

1338
01:53:09,050 --> 01:53:10,510
Can I've a cigarette?

1339
01:53:54,350 --> 01:53:55,640
Hello.

1340
01:53:55,720 --> 01:53:56,760
Come in.

1341
01:53:56,850 --> 01:54:00,260
Careful. Careful. Careful.

1342
01:54:01,930 --> 01:54:03,300
Come in.

1343
01:54:04,430 --> 01:54:05,680
Hello.

1344
01:54:05,760 --> 01:54:07,430
-Come.
-Looking nice.

1345
01:54:08,680 --> 01:54:10,010
-Come in.
-Come.

1346
01:54:13,890 --> 01:54:15,550
It's gold.

1347
01:54:22,140 --> 01:54:23,350
Meenakshi.

1348
01:54:24,010 --> 01:54:25,720
I don't see Meenakshi anywhere.

1349
01:54:38,140 --> 01:54:40,220
She's gone to the temple.

1350
01:54:40,850 --> 01:54:42,850
To pray to our family deity.

1351
01:54:43,600 --> 01:54:47,680
We don't carry out any auspicious event
before praying to her.

1352
01:54:48,510 --> 01:54:49,600
I see.

1353
01:54:51,600 --> 01:54:52,800
Nana.

1354
01:54:54,180 --> 01:54:55,430
Nana.

1355
01:54:55,970 --> 01:54:57,010
Nana.

1356
01:54:57,100 --> 01:54:58,600
Madhav has arrived, Nana.

1357
01:54:58,680 --> 01:55:00,470
-What now?
-Look here.

1358
01:55:00,800 --> 01:55:02,930
Her office diary.

1359
01:55:03,050 --> 01:55:04,550
It has some useful numbers.

1360
01:55:04,640 --> 01:55:05,680
Look.

1361
01:55:05,760 --> 01:55:07,760
Some Mynah.

1362
01:55:08,180 --> 01:55:10,050
I'll go check with her.

1363
01:55:10,140 --> 01:55:12,350
Maybe... we can learn something.

1364
01:55:12,930 --> 01:55:16,050
Then go, Nana! Go quickly!

1365
01:55:16,260 --> 01:55:17,800
Bring her back from wherever she is.

1366
01:56:27,300 --> 01:56:29,300
Save me!

1367
01:56:32,550 --> 01:56:35,930
Here, Madhav. Have some sweets. Sweets.

1368
01:56:36,010 --> 01:56:38,350
We aren't here for the sweets.

1369
01:56:38,430 --> 01:56:39,470
Where is Meenakshi?

1370
01:56:40,010 --> 01:56:41,470
She...

1371
01:56:41,550 --> 01:56:43,470
What's wrong, Mom? Where's Meenakshi?

1372
01:57:39,640 --> 01:57:41,890
Save me!

1373
01:57:52,850 --> 01:57:54,760
Save me!

1374
01:57:57,970 --> 01:58:01,140
-Hi.
-What the...

1375
01:58:02,970 --> 01:58:04,180
Hi.

1376
01:58:07,010 --> 01:58:08,550
I knew it.

1377
01:58:08,640 --> 01:58:09,850
I knew it.

1378
01:58:09,930 --> 01:58:11,600
Today's the night.

1379
01:58:12,680 --> 01:58:14,350
You were destined to come here.

1380
01:58:14,800 --> 01:58:17,430
To me. In my arms.

1381
01:58:17,800 --> 01:58:21,260
All this is happening with me
for the first time.

1382
01:58:21,350 --> 01:58:23,260
But the feeling is wonderful.

1383
01:58:23,350 --> 01:58:25,930
And I feel something happening as well.

1384
01:58:26,010 --> 01:58:28,180
Drink. Drink.

1385
01:58:32,850 --> 01:58:35,300
You're mine.
I am yours.

1386
01:58:35,550 --> 01:58:37,510
-An astrologer once told me.
-What?

1387
01:58:37,600 --> 01:58:39,180
This full moon night

1388
01:58:39,390 --> 01:58:42,850
the love of your life
will come ringing the bell.

1389
01:58:44,050 --> 01:58:46,680
The bell in my heart.

1390
01:58:47,600 --> 01:58:49,140
The bell in my mind.

1391
01:58:49,970 --> 01:58:53,010
And that young man will be your beloved.

1392
01:58:53,100 --> 01:58:55,510
Your love. Your sweetheart.

1393
01:58:58,850 --> 01:59:01,220
I can hear bells.

1394
02:03:14,970 --> 02:03:17,720
What to do
Not to do

1395
02:03:18,390 --> 02:03:21,010
Stop thinking, just do-do

1396
02:03:21,890 --> 02:03:24,550
Some things I do myself

1397
02:03:25,510 --> 02:03:27,930
The rest you do

1398
02:03:28,010 --> 02:03:30,720
Come closer, darling
Just do, do, do-do

1399
02:03:31,510 --> 02:03:34,100
Play the beat, touch it, touch it

1400
02:03:35,050 --> 02:03:39,350
Baby, I'll have your honor
Served to me on a platter

1401
02:03:40,550 --> 02:03:41,800
Oh baby, yeah!

1402
02:03:42,430 --> 02:03:44,100
Served on a platter

1403
02:03:44,180 --> 02:03:45,680
Oh baby, yeah!

1404
02:03:45,760 --> 02:03:47,180
Served on a platter

1405
02:03:47,680 --> 02:03:49,010
Oh baby, yeah!

1406
02:03:49,550 --> 02:03:51,220
Served on a platter

1407
02:03:53,930 --> 02:03:56,430
Mom said not to do

1408
02:03:57,680 --> 02:03:59,600
I feel shy, what to do?

1409
02:04:01,050 --> 02:04:03,760
What you doing to me?

1410
02:04:04,220 --> 02:04:06,930
I myself do-do

1411
02:04:07,180 --> 02:04:10,180
How do I do-do-do-do?

1412
02:04:10,640 --> 02:04:13,970
No touch you-touch you-touch-you

1413
02:04:14,260 --> 02:04:18,760
How do I save my honor
Being served on a platter

1414
02:04:21,300 --> 02:04:22,510
Served on a platter

1415
02:04:25,010 --> 02:04:26,140
Served on a platter

1416
02:05:19,390 --> 02:05:20,390
Oh my!

1417
02:05:34,260 --> 02:05:36,800
Mom said not to do

1418
02:05:37,800 --> 02:05:40,100
I feel coy, what to do?

1419
02:05:41,350 --> 02:05:44,180
Some things I do myself

1420
02:05:44,890 --> 02:05:47,050
The rest you do

1421
02:05:47,390 --> 02:05:50,510
Come closer, darling
Just do, do, do-do

1422
02:05:50,600 --> 02:05:52,010
No do-do-do
No do-do-do

1423
02:05:52,100 --> 02:05:54,510
No, no, no touch
You-touch you-touch-you

1424
02:05:54,600 --> 02:05:58,970
How do I save my honor
Being served on a plate?

1425
02:06:01,010 --> 02:06:04,430
One little seed, two little see
Another do on that do

1426
02:06:04,510 --> 02:06:07,930
A blemish on your honor
Served on a platter

1427
02:06:08,100 --> 02:06:09,850
Honor served on a platter

1428
02:06:50,390 --> 02:06:52,930
I... I...

1429
02:07:03,010 --> 02:07:04,140
Meenakshi.

1430
02:07:08,720 --> 02:07:10,260
Please stay.

1431
02:07:11,640 --> 02:07:12,890
Don't go.

1432
02:07:13,680 --> 02:07:16,010
Will you please come with me?

1433
02:07:34,760 --> 02:07:36,550
This factory belonged to my father.

1434
02:07:37,890 --> 02:07:40,390
He passed away four years ago

1435
02:07:40,470 --> 02:07:41,800
and I've been managing it since.

1436
02:07:43,890 --> 02:07:46,720
I mean, it functions on its own

1437
02:07:47,430 --> 02:07:49,760
I just keep a watch.

1438
02:07:54,010 --> 02:07:56,260
My mother doesn't like to see me painting.

1439
02:07:57,600 --> 02:08:01,600
She wants me to get a job abroad

1440
02:08:02,510 --> 02:08:04,640
or stay here and expand this factory.

1441
02:08:06,640 --> 02:08:08,430
But I don't know anything else.

1442
02:08:09,350 --> 02:08:11,220
I'm happy only when I paint.

1443
02:08:12,760 --> 02:08:14,470
So I attend college in the morning.

1444
02:08:14,930 --> 02:08:16,550
Paint in the afternoons.

1445
02:08:17,260 --> 02:08:18,550
And handle this place at night.

1446
02:08:20,510 --> 02:08:22,010
And you?

1447
02:08:22,800 --> 02:08:24,680
Do you like your job?

1448
02:08:25,930 --> 02:08:27,260
Who's in your family?

1449
02:08:30,260 --> 02:08:32,550
My mother-father, grandma.

1450
02:08:33,510 --> 02:08:35,300
And a younger brother.

1451
02:08:37,010 --> 02:08:40,100
But these days they're too keen on
getting me out of the house.

1452
02:08:40,680 --> 02:08:41,930
What?

1453
02:08:44,430 --> 02:08:45,640
It's nothing.

1454
02:08:52,640 --> 02:08:55,510
By the way, I asked about you
in the college.

1455
02:08:57,850 --> 02:08:59,220
I am so sorry.

1456
02:09:00,180 --> 02:09:02,350
Yes, I know.

1457
02:09:03,390 --> 02:09:04,970
I drink.

1458
02:09:07,140 --> 02:09:09,260
No, never.

1459
02:09:10,220 --> 02:09:12,800
I don't have the time or the money.

1460
02:09:14,720 --> 02:09:18,390
I stay alone
and never give anyone any explanation.

1461
02:09:18,890 --> 02:09:24,260
I... Everyone I asked...

1462
02:09:26,220 --> 02:09:27,510
I mean...

1463
02:09:27,970 --> 02:09:29,850
Why did you ask others?

1464
02:09:30,510 --> 02:09:31,760
You should've asked me.

1465
02:09:39,550 --> 02:09:40,760
I'll drop you home.

1466
02:09:48,100 --> 02:09:53,140
I love you.

1467
02:10:02,050 --> 02:10:04,350
-What's wrong?
-Nothing?

1468
02:10:32,720 --> 02:10:34,430
Mom! Dad!

1469
02:10:34,680 --> 02:10:38,220
She's my future wife!

1470
02:10:41,260 --> 02:10:42,510
Oh, my God!

1471
02:10:44,140 --> 02:10:45,970
Thank you! Thank you!

1472
02:10:47,010 --> 02:10:48,930
Good. Good.

1473
02:10:49,140 --> 02:10:50,890
All the arrangements are in place.

1474
02:10:51,260 --> 02:10:52,510
Good.

1475
02:10:53,010 --> 02:10:55,220
The relatives are here.

1476
02:10:56,260 --> 02:10:57,550
Good.

1477
02:10:57,930 --> 02:11:02,350
So why not start our engagement right now!

1478
02:11:03,850 --> 02:11:05,050
Yes!

1479
02:11:05,140 --> 02:11:07,390
Musicians. Start!

1480
02:11:08,140 --> 02:11:09,550
Yes, start.

1481
02:11:09,640 --> 02:11:12,140
Nana. Nana, what's going on?

1482
02:11:12,890 --> 02:11:13,930
And where's Meenakshi?

1483
02:11:14,010 --> 02:11:15,760
You went to get her.
So who is this?

1484
02:11:15,850 --> 02:11:16,930
Madhav.

1485
02:11:18,220 --> 02:11:19,760
I understand what you're saying?

1486
02:11:21,640 --> 02:11:22,760
But who is she?

1487
02:11:26,220 --> 02:11:27,550
We want to see her face.

1488
02:11:28,430 --> 02:11:29,800
No, no.

1489
02:11:29,890 --> 02:11:30,970
No!

1490
02:11:33,760 --> 02:11:37,850
She will show her face
only after the engagement.

1491
02:11:37,930 --> 02:11:40,930
And tell her name
only after the engagement.

1492
02:11:42,430 --> 02:11:46,550
Mom, Dad, you'll be happy to know

1493
02:11:46,640 --> 02:11:51,010
that her parents, who live abroad

1494
02:11:51,720 --> 02:11:57,010
have promised to give me
a sum of ten million

1495
02:11:57,100 --> 02:11:58,970
for my Dog House project!

1496
02:12:10,760 --> 02:12:14,720
I don't drink. I don't drink.
I don't drink.

1497
02:12:15,550 --> 02:12:19,140
I don't drink either, I don't
drink either, I don't drink either.

1498
02:12:19,850 --> 02:12:23,800
Two sober people, on an empty road

1499
02:12:23,890 --> 02:12:27,390
in a empty city, on an old scooter

1500
02:12:27,470 --> 02:12:32,680
which has a faint smell of petrol.

1501
02:12:37,720 --> 02:12:39,800
I got 50% in my tenth exam.

1502
02:12:39,890 --> 02:12:41,140
Oh my!

1503
02:12:41,390 --> 02:12:43,260
I scored 49.60.

1504
02:12:56,300 --> 02:12:57,970
You can drop me here.

1505
02:12:59,970 --> 02:13:02,760
I'll manage it from here.

1506
02:13:03,600 --> 02:13:06,970
-Thank you for dropping me.
-It's alright.

1507
02:13:18,510 --> 02:13:19,550
Oh my!

1508
02:13:23,640 --> 02:13:24,800
Madhav.

1509
02:13:41,800 --> 02:13:42,890
Meenakshi.

1510
02:13:53,350 --> 02:13:55,350
You've been following me
for the past few days.

1511
02:13:56,350 --> 02:13:59,220
You turn up everywhere I go.

1512
02:14:00,640 --> 02:14:02,800
Why? What does it mean?

1513
02:14:04,050 --> 02:14:06,430
I... I...

1514
02:14:07,640 --> 02:14:08,930
I...

1515
02:14:09,010 --> 02:14:12,720
You followed me as soon
as I left college today.

1516
02:14:13,680 --> 02:14:15,680
And you were standing under my house
till evening.

1517
02:14:20,760 --> 02:14:22,390
I don't know why you're doing all this?

1518
02:14:23,760 --> 02:14:27,720
And then you said your family
wants to get you out of the house.

1519
02:14:33,050 --> 02:14:36,930
And mine wants someone to enter.

1520
02:14:40,470 --> 02:14:43,300
I mean, my mother wants someone
to come home.

1521
02:14:45,140 --> 02:14:47,600
She wants a daughter-in-law
that's smart

1522
02:14:48,260 --> 02:14:50,390
and never scared of anyone.

1523
02:14:51,140 --> 02:14:54,760
And she's willing to go anywhere
she wants at anytime!

1524
02:14:55,850 --> 02:14:57,050
Oh my!

1525
02:15:51,850 --> 02:15:54,970
I like dark people and not fair.

1526
02:15:55,050 --> 02:15:56,470
Teach me how to say that.

1527
02:15:57,800 --> 02:16:00,680
I like dark people and not fair.

1528
02:16:09,010 --> 02:16:10,140
My handkerchief.

1529
02:16:33,100 --> 02:16:34,600
What are you doing?

1530
02:16:40,300 --> 02:16:42,850
My... Where did...

1531
02:16:44,800 --> 02:16:45,850
I'll tell you.

1532
02:17:04,760 --> 02:17:06,800
I love you.

1533
02:17:08,970 --> 02:17:10,550
That's how you say it in Tamil.

1534
02:17:11,260 --> 02:17:12,680
Oh my!

1535
02:17:17,800 --> 02:17:20,390
Yes! Yes! Yes!

1536
02:17:20,600 --> 02:17:21,800
Celebration.

1537
02:17:21,890 --> 02:17:23,600
Lord of the Ring.

1538
02:17:25,930 --> 02:17:28,100
Show us your face now, daughter-in-law.

1539
02:17:29,100 --> 02:17:31,300
-Meenakshi.
-Madhav.

1540
02:17:31,800 --> 02:17:33,430
Where were you?
Are you all right?

1541
02:17:34,550 --> 02:17:37,970
Didn't I tell you
Meenakshi will be back soon.

1542
02:17:38,970 --> 02:17:40,640
And who is this with you?

1543
02:17:41,470 --> 02:17:44,510
Dad, he's... Mom, he's Surya.

1544
02:17:45,720 --> 02:17:46,760
Meenakshi!

1545
02:17:46,970 --> 02:17:47,970
Mynah!

1546
02:17:52,680 --> 02:17:54,220
What are you doing here?

1547
02:17:55,350 --> 02:17:57,850
And weren't you supposed
to get engaged today?

1548
02:17:59,390 --> 02:18:03,470
Look. I got engaged, too.

1549
02:18:04,220 --> 02:18:07,510
He's my husband... Nana.

1550
02:18:08,220 --> 02:18:10,680
-Husband?
-What kind of a girl is she?

1551
02:18:12,430 --> 02:18:14,180
Is she drunk?

1552
02:18:15,510 --> 02:18:17,260
What's going on here?

1553
02:18:17,640 --> 02:18:20,430
Nana. When did you meet Mynah?

1554
02:18:22,180 --> 02:18:23,800
And wasn't today my engagement?

1555
02:18:37,470 --> 02:18:38,470
Hello, welcome.

1556
02:19:27,430 --> 02:19:28,720
Surya.

1557
02:19:31,890 --> 02:19:34,430
-Congrats.
-Thank you.

1558
02:19:39,850 --> 02:19:41,180
Stay happy.

1559
02:19:42,890 --> 02:19:48,970
And don't forget to watch the films
I recommended.

1560
02:19:50,510 --> 02:19:54,180
And... don't ever forget
that we're always good friends

1561
02:19:54,260 --> 02:19:56,100
-and we'll always be.
-Meenakshi.

1562
02:19:57,600 --> 02:20:00,640
Those Rose Day dialogs don't work here.

1563
02:20:02,550 --> 02:20:05,550
I'm sure we'll cross ways again in life.

1564
02:20:07,180 --> 02:20:08,390
Stay happy.

1565
02:20:09,760 --> 02:20:11,050
Thank you, Madhav.

1566
02:20:12,390 --> 02:20:14,050
I'll take your leave.

1567
02:20:30,640 --> 02:20:31,760
What now?

1568
02:20:33,220 --> 02:20:35,970
I want to marry your daughter.

1569
02:20:38,550 --> 02:20:42,890
Mom. Dad. I like Surya.

1570
02:20:43,890 --> 02:20:46,140
And now I know him really well.

1571
02:20:46,800 --> 02:20:48,390
I'll be happy with him.

1572
02:20:49,390 --> 02:20:51,100
Surya's a great painter.

1573
02:20:51,890 --> 02:20:53,800
And consider

1574
02:20:53,890 --> 02:20:56,600
that we will stay really happy.

1575
02:20:56,970 --> 02:21:01,140
I've observed him from all sides.
I liked everything about him.

1576
02:21:01,850 --> 02:21:04,600
His height, his chest,

1577
02:21:04,760 --> 02:21:07,800
his eyes, his hair, his house...

1578
02:21:08,760 --> 02:21:10,510
What else do I say, mother?

1579
02:21:10,600 --> 02:21:11,970
I'm feeling so sleepy.

1580
02:21:12,050 --> 02:21:13,220
Give us your blessings.

1581
02:21:13,390 --> 02:21:14,930
Tell me fast.

1582
02:21:15,010 --> 02:21:16,300
Meenakshi.

1583
02:21:17,300 --> 02:21:20,010
I want to get engaged to Surya.

1584
02:21:24,470 --> 02:21:26,850
If you two are happy

1585
02:21:26,930 --> 02:21:28,470
then there's nothing else we want.

1586
02:21:29,600 --> 02:21:32,220
And anyway, we can't make out

1587
02:21:32,680 --> 02:21:35,050
whether this is a dream or reality.

1588
02:21:36,220 --> 02:21:37,930
Whether it's day or night.

1589
02:21:39,010 --> 02:21:41,680
Everything that's happening
since last night

1590
02:21:41,760 --> 02:21:44,180
is beyond my understanding.

1591
02:21:45,470 --> 02:21:47,140
It's not a dream, Dad.

1592
02:21:47,260 --> 02:21:49,970
It's reality.
And it's a wonderful reality.

1593
02:21:51,180 --> 02:21:54,050
Mom, Dad. Please give us your blessings.

1594
02:22:38,180 --> 02:22:42,930
Whatever's written in our destiny

1595
02:22:45,930 --> 02:22:49,970
Can never be averted

1596
02:22:53,140 --> 02:22:57,510
The groom's from down south

1597
02:23:00,470 --> 02:23:04,260
And he's marrying a Pune girl

1598
02:23:07,350 --> 02:23:10,680
Fate's played a mischief

1599
02:23:10,760 --> 02:23:14,100
This is a unique match

1600
02:23:14,430 --> 02:23:16,890
Unique

1601
02:23:18,180 --> 02:23:19,600
It was never heard of

1602
02:23:19,850 --> 02:23:21,010
Everyone's amazed

1603
02:23:21,470 --> 02:23:24,970
Unique

1604
02:23:25,640 --> 02:23:28,510
It's a bit strange

1605
02:23:28,720 --> 02:23:31,760
Unique

1606
02:23:32,760 --> 02:23:34,470
It was never heard of

1607
02:23:34,550 --> 02:23:36,010
Everyone's amazed

1608
02:23:36,100 --> 02:23:39,680
Unique

1609
02:23:40,010 --> 02:23:43,390
It's a bit strange

1610
02:23:43,470 --> 02:23:45,100
Unique

1611
02:24:07,510 --> 02:24:10,600
Warm welcome to all the kin

1612
02:24:11,180 --> 02:24:12,970
Welcome

1613
02:24:13,050 --> 02:24:14,760
Welcome

1614
02:24:14,850 --> 02:24:18,220
Warm welcome to the new relations

1615
02:24:18,300 --> 02:24:20,180
Welcome

1616
02:24:20,260 --> 02:24:21,260
Welcome

1617
02:24:21,510 --> 02:24:24,720
The music's playing

1618
02:24:25,220 --> 02:24:28,800
Congratulations to everyone

1619
02:24:28,890 --> 02:24:32,350
One plus one free

1620
02:24:32,430 --> 02:24:36,050
Two engagements for the cost of one

1621
02:24:36,140 --> 02:24:39,550
This moment of engagement is

1622
02:24:39,640 --> 02:24:43,180
Unique

1623
02:24:43,550 --> 02:24:44,850
It was never heard of

1624
02:24:45,430 --> 02:24:46,800
Everyone's amazed

1625
02:24:46,930 --> 02:24:50,430
