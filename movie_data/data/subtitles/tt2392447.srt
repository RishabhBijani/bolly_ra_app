1
00:01:01,676 --> 00:01:02,814
Kiran...

2
00:01:03,643 --> 00:01:06,089
You wait here.
I'll be right back.

3
00:01:11,485 --> 00:01:12,554
- Oh, Mr. Dubey!

4
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:14,439
Good morning! - Good morning!
- Have a seat!

5
00:01:15,455 --> 00:01:17,436
No matter what day of the week it is...

6
00:01:17,925 --> 00:01:20,166
you always show up
here to put pressure on me.

7
00:01:20,628 --> 00:01:23,905
Well, all I need
from you is my pension.

8
00:01:23,964 --> 00:01:25,341
After that...

9
00:01:25,766 --> 00:01:28,975
In any case, I don't enjoy
unnecessarily doing the rounds here.

10
00:01:29,036 --> 00:01:32,279
No, no... do the rounds!
It's good exercise!

11
00:01:32,339 --> 00:01:33,875
Listen...
- No, you listen!

12
00:01:33,974 --> 00:01:35,749
Look at this pile of files.

13
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:37,880
And here's your file.

14
00:01:37,978 --> 00:01:41,892
When it reaches the top,
you'll get your money.

15
00:01:41,982 --> 00:01:46,863
My files hasn't moved up
for two years now.

16
00:01:47,321 --> 00:01:48,698
Oh, Mr. Shinde!

17
00:01:48,756 --> 00:01:51,794
Try and bring Mr. Dubey's file up.

18
00:01:51,892 --> 00:01:53,929
I'm ready to do it, Mr. Sharma,

19
00:01:54,228 --> 00:01:57,004
but to reach the top,
it needs a little monetary push...

20
00:01:57,398 --> 00:02:01,438
And Mr. Dubey isn't ready to give
it the right push... what can I do?

21
00:02:02,137 --> 00:02:04,583
You people should be
ashamed of yourselves.

22
00:02:05,806 --> 00:02:08,185
I'm old enough to be your father!

23
00:02:08,276 --> 00:02:11,553
Then think of us as your sons
and give us the money.

24
00:02:14,349 --> 00:02:16,454
But remember one thing, Mr. Dubey...

25
00:02:16,985 --> 00:02:19,226
- Today you're our father's age...

26
00:02:19,621 --> 00:02:21,897
- but if you wait too long...

27
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:24,670
- you'll be our grandfather's age
by the time your file comes up!

28
00:02:24,993 --> 00:02:26,768
The things you say, Gupta!

29
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:31,006
Give me my money.

30
00:02:31,099 --> 00:02:32,840
He's lost it!

31
00:02:32,934 --> 00:02:35,039
Throw him out!
- You can't do this to me.

32
00:02:35,137 --> 00:02:36,411
Get him out of here!

33
00:02:36,471 --> 00:02:39,247
This is my life's savings!
- Out!

34
00:02:39,307 --> 00:02:40,809
I'm not begging!

35
00:02:40,909 --> 00:02:43,322
Don't show your face here again!
- Give me my money.

36
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:45,449
Come on, come on.

37
00:02:45,514 --> 00:02:47,425
Please! Let him go!

38
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:51,294
They're treating me like a beggar.

39
00:02:52,054 --> 00:02:56,229
Look where your file is going now...
right to the bottom!

40
00:02:59,795 --> 00:03:01,571
- How dare he manhandle me?

41
00:03:02,031 --> 00:03:03,567
Get him out of here!

42
00:03:06,334 --> 00:03:07,575
Dad!

43
00:03:09,304 --> 00:03:10,409
Dad!

44
00:03:11,474 --> 00:03:12,474
Dad!

45
00:03:12,508 --> 00:03:13,953
Dad! Dad!

46
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,447
Dad! Dad!

47
00:03:19,148 --> 00:03:20,388
Is my father okay?

48
00:03:20,483 --> 00:03:22,429
Yes... it was a minor stroke.

49
00:03:22,518 --> 00:03:27,024
This isn't the age for him
to be getting into fights.

50
00:03:27,089 --> 00:03:31,299
But, Doctor,
that's his hard earned money.

51
00:03:31,394 --> 00:03:35,137
And at this age, he can only
support himself with his pension.

52
00:03:35,231 --> 00:03:38,508
- But another incident
like this, could prove fatal.

53
00:03:38,935 --> 00:03:40,915
- You have to keep that in mind.

54
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:43,609
- It's a good thing
you brought him here quickly...

55
00:03:47,176 --> 00:03:48,781
Nepali and his two thugs.

56
00:03:49,279 --> 00:03:51,155
Looks like Samad Khan's work.

57
00:03:51,548 --> 00:03:52,548
Wow.

58
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:55,520
You news guys know
everything before we do.

59
00:03:55,718 --> 00:03:56,992
What can I say, Inspector.

60
00:03:57,221 --> 00:03:59,564
Nowadays, we journalists
have to do your work, too...

61
00:03:59,622 --> 00:04:00,397
Oh, really?

62
00:04:00,457 --> 00:04:03,438
Sir, I've told you in the beginning...

63
00:04:03,727 --> 00:04:06,401
It takes Rs. 11,000
to fix this computer.

64
00:04:06,763 --> 00:04:08,935
Now how can I give you
a discount of Rs. 2,000?

65
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:10,910
Stop whining for Rs. 2,000!

66
00:04:10,968 --> 00:04:12,777
You're the one whining, sir.

67
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:14,676
I sell hardware, not underwear.

68
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:17,012
Okay, take Rs. 9,500.
Final.

69
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:18,380
Not a rupee more.

70
00:04:18,475 --> 00:04:19,545
Rs. 11,000 or else...

71
00:04:19,643 --> 00:04:23,819
I'll show your wife all those
porn films from your hard disc.

72
00:04:23,881 --> 00:04:26,088
Everything's been saved on this CD.

73
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,524
Forget underwear...

74
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:33,358
your hardware
will turn into software.

75
00:04:34,558 --> 00:04:36,470
Relax, I'm giving you Rs. 11,000!

76
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,973
Can't we joke around a bit?

77
00:04:45,003 --> 00:04:46,003
- Kalim!

78
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:47,574
- Your phone!

79
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:53,153
Here! 11,000 in full!

80
00:04:54,646 --> 00:04:55,646
Hi, Maya.

81
00:04:55,812 --> 00:04:57,087
- We need to meet...

82
00:04:58,483 --> 00:05:01,020
I think we've got our first case.

83
00:05:30,014 --> 00:05:32,290
- Who switched on these lights?!

84
00:05:41,961 --> 00:05:42,961
Quiet.

85
00:05:43,027 --> 00:05:44,632
Listen carefully.

86
00:05:46,531 --> 00:05:49,444
These time bombs
will now be activated.

87
00:05:50,101 --> 00:05:56,576
As long as you keep running around
this stadium... they won't go off.

88
00:05:58,242 --> 00:06:04,591
But if any one of you
stops running... BOOM!

89
00:06:05,718 --> 00:06:07,595
Why are you doing this to us?!

90
00:06:07,685 --> 00:06:11,828
Because you three enjoy
making helpless folk...

91
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:15,804
do the rounds of
your office for years.

92
00:06:16,295 --> 00:06:19,902
This time however,
to save your own lives...

93
00:06:19,965 --> 00:06:22,445
you'll be doing the rounds.

94
00:06:22,501 --> 00:06:27,280
Listen, please...
We're ready to pay you anything.

95
00:06:27,339 --> 00:06:28,977
We'll give you money!

96
00:06:29,074 --> 00:06:30,747
Lots of money!

97
00:06:30,809 --> 00:06:32,982
That's the difference
between us and you.

98
00:06:33,512 --> 00:06:35,356
We don't take bribes.

99
00:06:36,782 --> 00:06:38,763
Please...
Don't do this, sir...

100
00:06:38,885 --> 00:06:40,488
Hello?
- On your marks!

101
00:06:40,552 --> 00:06:41,752
Is this the Aaj Tak News Room?

102
00:06:42,022 --> 00:06:42,863
- Get set!

103
00:06:42,921 --> 00:06:44,868
I have some a very
interesting story for you.

104
00:06:44,924 --> 00:06:46,027
Go!

105
00:06:52,398 --> 00:06:53,639
Hello, Police?

106
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:59,678
Come on, Maya, let's get out of here.

107
00:07:17,323 --> 00:07:19,325
Keep running!
Don't stop!

108
00:07:19,693 --> 00:07:21,070
Keep running!

109
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,179
Keep running!
Don't stop!

110
00:07:37,944 --> 00:07:39,355
Come on, keep running!

111
00:07:39,446 --> 00:07:42,222
Don't stop, don't stop!
- Get back!

112
00:07:43,016 --> 00:07:45,189
Keep running!

113
00:07:54,028 --> 00:07:55,267
Bomb squad!

114
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:57,701
Hurry up!

115
00:08:14,315 --> 00:08:15,885
Sir, it's just a firecracker!

116
00:08:23,124 --> 00:08:24,603
- In Breaking News -

117
00:08:24,692 --> 00:08:28,732
- Three government officials
were kidnapped by a masked gang...

118
00:08:28,797 --> 00:08:31,477
- who then made a tape of them
which they sent to all news channels.

119
00:08:31,532 --> 00:08:33,478
Let' see what they had to say.

120
00:08:33,634 --> 00:08:38,084
We've been talking about
fighting corruption for 65 years...

121
00:08:39,473 --> 00:08:41,976
but nothing's really happened.

122
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:44,986
We've only worn out our shoes
with candle marches...

123
00:08:45,246 --> 00:08:47,488
landed up in hospitals
when we went on hunger strikes.

124
00:08:47,848 --> 00:08:51,318
Peaceful processions only
got us beaten up by the police...

125
00:08:51,685 --> 00:08:53,097
Nothing ever changes.

126
00:08:54,488 --> 00:08:56,901
But now, things will change.

127
00:08:57,825 --> 00:09:04,242
By punishing corrupt people
like Sharma, Gupta and Shinde.

128
00:09:05,066 --> 00:09:09,014
From this moment,
decent citizens like Makrand Dubey...

129
00:09:09,271 --> 00:09:11,512
will not be victims of
corruption anymore.

130
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:16,714
When, both,
the right and wrong way fail...

131
00:09:17,345 --> 00:09:19,415
you have to take the middle road.

132
00:12:15,994 --> 00:12:18,201
- Sharma, Gupta and Shinde have
been charged with bribery...

133
00:12:18,262 --> 00:12:20,936
Manav, I want to follow
this gang's story.

134
00:12:21,299 --> 00:12:23,074
Alright. Do it.

135
00:12:25,103 --> 00:12:27,083
- As for the masked gang...

136
00:12:27,138 --> 00:12:31,985
citizens have praised them
and also accepted them with open arms.

137
00:12:32,076 --> 00:12:33,818
- Let's hear what they have to say.

138
00:12:35,146 --> 00:12:38,286
They made those corrupt officers
dizzy by making them do rounds!

139
00:12:38,349 --> 00:12:40,886
It used to feel like being
retired is a crime in this country.

140
00:12:40,985 --> 00:12:42,988
By getting Mr. Dubey
what is rightfully his...

141
00:12:43,055 --> 00:12:45,899
they've stood up
for every senior citizen.

142
00:12:45,991 --> 00:12:48,631
This gang that gave
the finger to corruption...

143
00:12:48,694 --> 00:12:51,698
has a new name from the citizens...

144
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:53,340
- The 'Ungli' (finger) gang.

145
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:54,566
You were right, guys!

146
00:12:54,633 --> 00:12:56,578
We have a name to
sign autographs with!

147
00:12:56,801 --> 00:12:58,042
The 'Ungli' Gang.
- Shhh...

148
00:12:58,337 --> 00:12:59,872
How cool is that!

149
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:02,313
Don't talk about autographs
in a public place..

150
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:04,080
If you don't want a
warrant with your name on it.

151
00:13:04,276 --> 00:13:05,754
- Relax a little.

152
00:13:06,712 --> 00:13:08,157
- This is just the beginning.

153
00:13:08,347 --> 00:13:10,759
We still have so many things to do.

154
00:13:11,183 --> 00:13:13,891
Guys, I was thinking...

155
00:13:15,154 --> 00:13:16,497
What's happened has happened.

156
00:13:16,822 --> 00:13:18,961
We've been lucky to not get caught.

157
00:13:19,024 --> 00:13:20,526
Let's not push it.

158
00:13:21,059 --> 00:13:22,538
What do you mean?

159
00:13:23,362 --> 00:13:24,841
Are you quitting?

160
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:26,668
I'm just scared, guys.

161
00:13:26,865 --> 00:13:30,313
How can you even think of stopping?
- Shhh!

162
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:32,640
- Especially now!

163
00:13:32,738 --> 00:13:35,241
Maya, this isn't a candle march.

164
00:13:35,707 --> 00:13:38,153
I run my house on my salary alone.

165
00:13:38,644 --> 00:13:40,681
What'll happen to my
family if I go to jail?

166
00:13:41,513 --> 00:13:43,118
Besides, who are we?

167
00:13:43,715 --> 00:13:47,219
Ajournalist, an intern,
a mechanic and a computer engineer?

168
00:13:48,555 --> 00:13:51,900
Beyond a point, we can't change squat!

169
00:13:51,991 --> 00:13:54,494
Goti... have you forgotten Ricky?

170
00:13:55,228 --> 00:13:56,535
- Let it be, man...

171
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:59,842
We've chosen our path.
Let Goti choose his.

172
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:01,607
Goti.

173
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,512
There's no pressure.

174
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:05,015
Take your time.

175
00:14:06,139 --> 00:14:08,448
Kalim, what happened
of our headquarter?

176
00:14:08,507 --> 00:14:09,953
I've found a perfect place.

177
00:14:17,817 --> 00:14:19,296
How much for this place?

178
00:14:19,352 --> 00:14:20,855
25,000 rupees a month.

179
00:14:20,954 --> 00:14:22,490
25,000?

180
00:14:22,689 --> 00:14:23,998
For this hole?!

181
00:14:25,024 --> 00:14:27,868
At this rate, this is the
best you can find in Mumbai!

182
00:14:28,561 --> 00:14:30,007
It's completely central.

183
00:14:30,297 --> 00:14:31,570
There's a McDonald's nearby.

184
00:14:31,631 --> 00:14:35,545
There's also a an Udipi
restaurant and a pizza joint!

185
00:14:35,602 --> 00:14:36,979
With free home delivery.

186
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:38,242
WOW!

187
00:14:38,471 --> 00:14:39,973
You should said that first!

188
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,111
Guys!

189
00:14:42,176 --> 00:14:45,180
I think this place
is good for the office.

190
00:14:45,813 --> 00:14:47,189
What do you think?

191
00:14:48,749 --> 00:14:52,094
And between the three of us,
the rent won't seem so high.

192
00:14:52,186 --> 00:14:53,493
Actually...

193
00:14:54,121 --> 00:14:57,659
It'll be even less if
it's between the four of us.

194
00:15:00,327 --> 00:15:01,362
Sorry.

195
00:15:01,428 --> 00:15:02,907
I chickened out a little.

196
00:15:04,031 --> 00:15:07,342
It's not important
that you chickened out...

197
00:15:07,401 --> 00:15:09,711
as long as you manned up on time!

198
00:15:16,277 --> 00:15:18,848
Mr. Dubey,
can you recognize those people?

199
00:15:19,246 --> 00:15:24,525
Even if I could, I wouldn't
tell you a thing about them.

200
00:15:24,885 --> 00:15:26,193
How many of them were there?

201
00:15:26,488 --> 00:15:27,864
3...no, 4!

202
00:15:28,022 --> 00:15:29,661
Sir, one of them was a girl.

203
00:15:29,724 --> 00:15:31,999
What car is this?
- It's a Tata Ventura.

204
00:15:32,059 --> 00:15:35,165
This video was recorded a
few minutes after the kidnapping.

205
00:15:35,229 --> 00:15:36,435
- Note down the car number.

206
00:15:40,868 --> 00:15:43,144
- Sir, no garage has any information.

207
00:15:43,237 --> 00:15:44,911
- I think the number plate was fake.

208
00:15:44,973 --> 00:15:46,576
Sir, according to this lab report...

209
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:50,350
the security guards were injected
with a sedative called Midazolam.

210
00:15:50,445 --> 00:15:55,359
It's impossible to get this sedative
without a Doctor's prescription.

211
00:15:59,955 --> 00:16:02,629
We couldn't find anything
from chemists of hospitals, either.

212
00:16:05,994 --> 00:16:07,029
Sir...

213
00:16:07,529 --> 00:16:09,805
Before the Ungli gang
gets out of control...

214
00:16:09,864 --> 00:16:11,935
we have to get Inspector
Kale on their case.

215
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,977
Sivaraman, have you lost your mind?

216
00:16:16,037 --> 00:16:17,380
Trust me, sir.

217
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:20,711
This way you can handle the
Thane district political parties...

218
00:16:20,942 --> 00:16:22,742
and the public and
media will be assured...

219
00:16:22,777 --> 00:16:25,348
that we're trying
to catch the Ungli gang.

220
00:16:25,447 --> 00:16:27,290
Sivaraman, I...
- Sir, I give you my word...

221
00:16:27,349 --> 00:16:29,455
that Kale will
not cause any problems.

222
00:16:29,918 --> 00:16:31,625
He respects me very much.

223
00:16:32,288 --> 00:16:33,766
I can handle him.

224
00:16:34,155 --> 00:16:35,692
I've called him today, sir.

225
00:16:36,057 --> 00:16:38,197
He's waiting to meet you.

226
00:16:40,128 --> 00:16:41,199
<i>O</i> kaY-

227
00:16:46,668 --> 00:16:48,410
How's Thane district?

228
00:16:48,471 --> 00:16:54,944
The officer before you used
to complain about the mosquitoes.

229
00:16:55,945 --> 00:16:57,754
Sir, I have no complaints...

230
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,253
the complaints will
come from the mosquitoes.

231
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:03,460
Unlike the previous officer,
I don't eat sugar...

232
00:17:03,986 --> 00:17:06,489
my blood is infused with salt.

233
00:17:08,424 --> 00:17:09,334
Kale.

234
00:17:09,392 --> 00:17:11,303
On my recommendation,
the commissioner...

235
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,341
wants to assign you
to a very important case.

236
00:17:14,997 --> 00:17:16,169
Which case, sir?

237
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:18,340
They call themselves the Ungli gang.

238
00:17:18,401 --> 00:17:20,938
They give the finger to
the system and law and order.

239
00:17:21,037 --> 00:17:23,313
I want them found and stopped.

240
00:17:23,506 --> 00:17:24,541
Okay, sir.

241
00:17:31,949 --> 00:17:32,688
You can't go in!

242
00:17:32,782 --> 00:17:33,590
Move!

243
00:17:33,749 --> 00:17:35,195
Hey! What's going on here?!

244
00:17:41,191 --> 00:17:42,464
Where's An sari?

245
00:17:42,525 --> 00:17:43,435
Tell me!

246
00:17:43,492 --> 00:17:44,733
What's going on here?!

247
00:17:48,497 --> 00:17:49,909
What's u p, An sari?

248
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,579
You're going to file a case, are you?!

249
00:17:53,337 --> 00:17:55,179
This is your final warning.

250
00:17:55,639 --> 00:17:59,416
If you don't take back
your lawsuit against Gaikwad...

251
00:17:59,476 --> 00:18:00,818
You're done for.

252
00:18:01,645 --> 00:18:03,056
Understand?

253
00:18:09,786 --> 00:18:10,992
Yes, Ali!

254
00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:16,731
When did this happen?

255
00:18:20,731 --> 00:18:21,971
Excuse me.

256
00:18:24,201 --> 00:18:25,442
Are you okay?

257
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:26,870
Yes.

258
00:18:27,104 --> 00:18:29,414
My bones and spirit are intact.

259
00:18:30,407 --> 00:18:32,546
I'm not going to hide like a coward.

260
00:18:32,743 --> 00:18:35,917
I'm will file an FIR
against Gaikwad today itself.

261
00:18:38,349 --> 00:18:40,522
Look what he's done to my computers.

262
00:18:42,586 --> 00:18:44,225
You'll be able to
recover my data, right?

263
00:18:44,322 --> 00:18:47,201
I'll try my best, Ali.

264
00:18:49,527 --> 00:18:50,835
Thanks, Gautam.

265
00:18:52,764 --> 00:18:55,506
He's been going to the Municipal
Corporation for 2 years now...

266
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,310
to get Gaikwad's
hoardings removed.

267
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:02,608
Gaikwad's men threatened
him a few times.

268
00:19:03,141 --> 00:19:05,712
But he didn't give up.

269
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:09,250
He's possibly thinking
of filing a lawsuit.

270
00:19:10,481 --> 00:19:12,518
- The FIR isn't going to do squat.

271
00:19:12,617 --> 00:19:15,860
The FIR is worth less
than the paper it's written on.

272
00:19:16,521 --> 00:19:18,194
He can't touch Gaikwad.

273
00:19:18,389 --> 00:19:20,164
Yeah, you're right.

274
00:19:21,025 --> 00:19:23,164
The police have explained
this to Ansari already.

275
00:19:23,728 --> 00:19:26,436
Filing a case will
cause even more trouble.

276
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,238
Next week is Gaikwad's birthday.

277
00:19:30,334 --> 00:19:33,508
Just see how his
sycophants will fill...

278
00:19:33,871 --> 00:19:39,116
every street corner
with 'Happy Birthday' posters.

279
00:19:43,081 --> 00:19:44,923
Next week is Gaikwad's birthday?

280
00:19:44,982 --> 00:19:46,428
Yeah. Why?

281
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:10,600
Who's there?!

282
00:22:14,168 --> 00:22:15,738
Security!

283
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:17,947
Who entered my house!

284
00:22:22,176 --> 00:22:23,519
Security!

285
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:25,280
Security!

286
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,455
Are you all dead?!

287
00:22:32,386 --> 00:22:33,730
Not a single wall was spared!

288
00:22:33,822 --> 00:22:34,959
Who entered this house?

289
00:22:35,022 --> 00:22:35,762
Who did this?!

290
00:22:35,856 --> 00:22:39,304
I just asked you that,
why are you asking me!

291
00:22:39,828 --> 00:22:40,931
Who entered this house?

292
00:22:41,028 --> 00:22:43,532
Tell me! Where else are these put up?!

293
00:22:43,898 --> 00:22:45,401
Behind you?! There's nothing!

294
00:22:45,634 --> 00:22:47,635
Your...
- Behind me?

295
00:22:49,604 --> 00:22:51,106
It's behind me?

296
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:57,356
- A message to all our politicians...

297
00:22:57,445 --> 00:23:00,016
This city is not
your personal property.

298
00:23:00,615 --> 00:23:02,288
It is the home of us citizens.

299
00:23:02,816 --> 00:23:05,161
And if anyone messes up our home...

300
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:09,396
then we won't hesitate
to mess up theirs.

301
00:23:10,859 --> 00:23:15,239
- Forget his posters in the city...

302
00:23:15,931 --> 00:23:19,378
Today onwards, Gaikwad won't
even pose for his family pictures.

303
00:23:19,668 --> 00:23:23,047
To hell with theory,
we love the Ungli Gang!

304
00:23:30,346 --> 00:23:34,122
- These politicians have ruined
the city with their damn posters!

305
00:23:34,416 --> 00:23:36,897
- This gang has taught
them a good lesson!

306
00:23:37,352 --> 00:23:39,799
This gang is really giving
the finger to corruption, huh?

307
00:23:40,722 --> 00:23:42,225
Not just the finger...

308
00:23:43,858 --> 00:23:45,998
they're completely
exposing the system.

309
00:23:50,198 --> 00:23:52,838
It's been two days since
the Ungli gang struck!

310
00:23:53,268 --> 00:23:56,078
Are you chasing them or faffing?!

311
00:23:56,271 --> 00:23:59,150
Sir, we are trying
our best to catch them.

312
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,744
Well, stop trying and catch them!

313
00:24:01,811 --> 00:24:06,521
- Next time, it won't be
but a higher power who calls.

314
00:24:06,816 --> 00:24:08,193
Hang up!

315
00:24:09,552 --> 00:24:12,089
- Why are these amateurs
proving so hard to catch?

316
00:24:13,289 --> 00:24:16,133
What do you need
to catch the Ungli gang?

317
00:24:16,725 --> 00:24:18,727
Sir, the Ungli gang
thinks differently.

318
00:24:19,061 --> 00:24:20,369
Their method is different.

319
00:24:20,429 --> 00:24:21,635
Their purpose is different.

320
00:24:21,997 --> 00:24:25,069
To catch them,
we have to think like them.

321
00:24:25,768 --> 00:24:26,747
We'll have to do something different.

322
00:24:26,803 --> 00:24:28,611
Then do something new!

323
00:24:37,179 --> 00:24:37,987
Yes, Mishra, tell me!

324
00:24:38,047 --> 00:24:41,962
- Kale, my blood pressure
is off the charts right now.

325
00:24:42,219 --> 00:24:43,561
Did Nikhil do something?

326
00:24:43,953 --> 00:24:45,160
- What do you think?

327
00:24:45,856 --> 00:24:47,027
Okay, I'm on my way.

328
00:24:49,226 --> 00:24:52,002
- Oh, Kale! Come, come...

329
00:24:57,768 --> 00:24:59,475
What a fortunate man you are.

330
00:25:00,637 --> 00:25:02,480
As far as I remember,

331
00:25:02,873 --> 00:25:07,015
Kale didn't even go to
get his son's report card...

332
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:09,454
but here he is
for your report card!

333
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:11,960
What has he done, Mishra?

334
00:25:12,115 --> 00:25:14,493
Listen to this story, carefully...

335
00:25:15,085 --> 00:25:20,195
because I've never told a story like
this in all my 47 years in this job.

336
00:25:21,792 --> 00:25:24,705
- Last night, around 12. 30 am...

337
00:25:24,928 --> 00:25:27,465
we got a call from
the Marine Line's girls' hostel.

338
00:25:28,498 --> 00:25:31,502
- Someone called the matron
and warned her...

339
00:25:31,902 --> 00:25:33,222
- there was a bomb in the hostel.

340
00:25:33,237 --> 00:25:35,410
Take your team and
check the first floor.

341
00:25:35,473 --> 00:25:36,780
Move fast!

342
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,582
- You take your team
and check the second floor!

343
00:25:39,676 --> 00:25:41,122
- Check every room!

344
00:25:46,483 --> 00:25:48,327
What are you doing here?!

345
00:25:49,152 --> 00:25:50,598
I was missing you.

346
00:25:51,322 --> 00:25:53,097
Couldn't wait until morning.

347
00:25:53,891 --> 00:25:57,168
Did you do all this?!

348
00:25:58,695 --> 00:26:03,372
Sometimes you have to use a
fake bomb to get to the real bomb...

349
00:26:05,703 --> 00:26:07,944
Are you trying to kiss me?

350
00:26:09,407 --> 00:26:11,045
It's what I'm known for!

351
00:26:23,521 --> 00:26:26,628
And now for the plot twist, Kale!

352
00:26:27,225 --> 00:26:32,232
- We traced the number
that called the matron...

353
00:26:32,498 --> 00:26:34,842
Guess where the call came from?

354
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,074
From my landline!

355
00:26:38,437 --> 00:26:42,475
A call from the Mumbai
Police Bomb Squad Chief!

356
00:26:44,109 --> 00:26:49,821
Now give me one reason to
not suspend this man right now!

357
00:26:49,915 --> 00:26:51,292
- One reason!

358
00:26:51,983 --> 00:26:56,262
Sir, I'll give you three
reasons to suspend me.

359
00:26:56,888 --> 00:26:58,423
One, I'm no good for this job.

360
00:26:58,724 --> 00:27:04,174
Two, my antics threaten to tarnish
my father's respect in the force.

361
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:08,442
And three,
I don't think I'm going to change.

362
00:27:10,235 --> 00:27:11,236
- Look, Kale!

363
00:27:11,303 --> 00:27:12,805
Look how disrespectful he is!

364
00:27:13,272 --> 00:27:14,478
Get out!

365
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,778
Thank you, sir.

366
00:27:17,476 --> 00:27:18,614
Thank you?!

367
00:27:19,344 --> 00:27:20,652
- You're laughing?!

368
00:27:20,846 --> 00:27:22,520
How was that funny?

369
00:27:22,615 --> 00:27:24,116
I'm sorry, Mishra.

370
00:27:24,183 --> 00:27:29,395
But even you have to admit; It's
an ingenious method to meet a girl.

371
00:27:30,155 --> 00:27:33,898
These methods will seem ingenious
if they're used to catch felons!

372
00:27:34,794 --> 00:27:36,238
Not to be a delinquent, yourself.

373
00:27:37,195 --> 00:27:39,334
His mind is no less
than any delinquent.

374
00:27:39,798 --> 00:27:41,403
And I don't want him in my squad!

375
00:27:42,801 --> 00:27:44,839
If you want to groom a criminal...
take him!

376
00:28:03,823 --> 00:28:05,496
Ashok! You?
Here?

377
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:07,303
Come, come in.

378
00:28:07,527 --> 00:28:09,063
It's been so long.

379
00:28:09,195 --> 00:28:10,334
Sit.

380
00:28:11,998 --> 00:28:13,342
Have some tea?

381
00:28:13,434 --> 00:28:14,434
No.

382
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:16,476
Where's Nikhil?

383
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,413
He's not home.

384
00:28:18,705 --> 00:28:20,048
He came and left.

385
00:28:21,641 --> 00:28:22,712
Why?

386
00:28:23,309 --> 00:28:24,788
What's he done now?

387
00:28:26,179 --> 00:28:30,753
If you hear the saga,
you'll start a war.

388
00:28:33,019 --> 00:28:34,522
I'm sorry, Ashok.

389
00:28:35,356 --> 00:28:39,132
You've done a lot for us
after Nikhil's father passed away.

390
00:28:39,993 --> 00:28:41,995
Arvind wasn't only my partner.

391
00:28:42,395 --> 00:28:43,773
He was my friend.

392
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:48,743
Whatever I've done has
been for that friendship.

393
00:28:49,103 --> 00:28:51,446
I've tried to make
Nikhil understand...

394
00:28:52,406 --> 00:28:54,544
but he's so stubborn.

395
00:28:55,242 --> 00:28:57,313
He's so like his
father in so many ways.

396
00:28:57,411 --> 00:28:58,685
Truly.

397
00:28:59,213 --> 00:29:01,159
But I haven't given up hope on him.

398
00:29:01,782 --> 00:29:06,094
Besides stubbornness, he
has so many qualities of his father.

399
00:29:06,687 --> 00:29:07,893
No problem.

400
00:29:08,155 --> 00:29:09,498
I'll find him.

401
00:29:40,488 --> 00:29:44,629
"Oh, girl your moves
Look so kinky to me."

402
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:49,438
"Oh girl, your dangling earrings
Look so funky to me."

403
00:29:49,864 --> 00:29:54,334
"Oh that killer look you give...
Like the sharp edge of a knife."

404
00:29:54,401 --> 00:29:59,112
"Oh girl, your tantrums...
Feel so hanky panky to me..."

405
00:29:59,207 --> 00:30:03,781
"Shake those hips
to the beats of a song."

406
00:30:03,878 --> 00:30:08,156
"And make this pauper
heart feel like a prince."

407
00:30:08,249 --> 00:30:11,958
"Put those high heels on
And, dance Basanti."

408
00:30:12,187 --> 00:30:14,258
"Dance Basanti."

409
00:30:14,556 --> 00:30:16,627
"Dance Basanti."

410
00:30:16,991 --> 00:30:21,371
"Forget all the limits and just
Dance Basanti."

411
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:23,609
"Dance Basanti."

412
00:30:24,232 --> 00:30:26,075
"Dance Basanti."

413
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:39,657
"O when you see me you go wild."

414
00:30:39,748 --> 00:30:42,023
"You want my love you want it now."

415
00:30:42,117 --> 00:30:44,427
"You see me dancing up a star."

416
00:30:44,486 --> 00:30:46,660
"You know,
you know that I'm the bomb."

417
00:30:46,756 --> 00:30:49,134
"Oh when I pump it
up on the floor-ohh."

418
00:30:49,191 --> 00:30:51,637
"I know the boys
be going uffo-oh."

419
00:30:51,894 --> 00:30:54,568
"And I'll be shakin' it up, takin'
it up, makin' it go, breakin' it up."

420
00:30:54,663 --> 00:30:56,267
"I'm gonna be funking it up."

421
00:30:56,998 --> 00:31:02,176
"Hey Basanti, where do you live?"

422
00:31:02,538 --> 00:31:07,078
"Hey Basanti,
open up the gates of your heart."

423
00:31:07,143 --> 00:31:11,785
"Oh, Basanti,
your smile's like an explosive."

424
00:31:11,881 --> 00:31:15,920
"From head to toe, you're a missile."

425
00:31:15,985 --> 00:31:20,661
"Shake those hips
to the beats of a song."

426
00:31:20,723 --> 00:31:25,002
"And I'll take whatever
satisfaction I get."

427
00:31:25,061 --> 00:31:28,701
"Handle your row of admirers
and just dance, Basanti."

428
00:31:29,164 --> 00:31:31,372
"Dance Basanti."

429
00:31:31,567 --> 00:31:33,514
"Dance Basanti."

430
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:38,184
"Forget all the limits
and just dance Basanti."

431
00:31:38,607 --> 00:31:40,610
"Dance Basanti."

432
00:31:40,876 --> 00:31:42,914
"Dance Basanti."

433
00:31:44,947 --> 00:31:47,325
"O when you see me you go wild."

434
00:31:47,416 --> 00:31:49,693
"You want my love you want it now."

435
00:31:49,786 --> 00:31:51,857
"You see me dancing up a star."

436
00:31:51,955 --> 00:31:54,765
"You know,
you know that I'm the bomb."

437
00:31:54,824 --> 00:31:57,498
"And I'll be shakin' it up, takin'
it up, makin' it go, breakin' it up."

438
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,039
"I'm gonna be funking it up."

439
00:32:06,203 --> 00:32:07,409
Yes, Kale sir.

440
00:32:07,704 --> 00:32:11,117
- Nikhil, meet me at
Lalit bar tomorrow at 7 pm.

441
00:32:11,909 --> 00:32:12,909
Why?

442
00:32:13,109 --> 00:32:14,885
Can't you lecture me on the phone?

443
00:32:15,112 --> 00:32:17,648
- I'll be waiting
there for you, Nikhil.

444
00:32:17,915 --> 00:32:19,120
- Be there.

445
00:32:25,288 --> 00:32:27,132
- All I want is news
about the Ungli Gang.

446
00:32:27,191 --> 00:32:28,066
- What is this bullshit, ya?

447
00:32:28,158 --> 00:32:30,078
- Not a single concrete
report on the Ungli Gang.

448
00:32:30,161 --> 00:32:31,730
What the hell do you
guys come to do here?!

449
00:32:31,828 --> 00:32:33,968
Can you please disperse
and get me something concrete?

450
00:32:34,232 --> 00:32:35,403
Go!

451
00:32:42,907 --> 00:32:44,214
Bad meeting?

452
00:32:45,142 --> 00:32:46,246
Don't ask.

453
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:47,946
Manav bit my head off.

454
00:32:48,045 --> 00:32:49,217
Ouch...

455
00:32:49,814 --> 00:32:53,023
So not a good idea to suggest coffee?

456
00:32:53,951 --> 00:32:54,986
Correct.

457
00:32:55,253 --> 00:32:58,598
What's Manav's problem?

458
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:00,025
This Ungli gang!

459
00:33:00,157 --> 00:33:01,363
Can't find a lead!

460
00:33:01,459 --> 00:33:05,305
And I'm getting cursed
because I'm handling the case.

461
00:33:05,796 --> 00:33:08,140
Can't understand why they're
getting so much importance.

462
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:13,508
Seems like a bunch of spoilt,
rich kids who want a bit of fame.

463
00:33:13,938 --> 00:33:15,542
Oh, right, I nearly forgot!

464
00:33:15,606 --> 00:33:18,610
You're the famous crime reporter,
Mr. Abhay Kashyap.

465
00:33:18,709 --> 00:33:21,247
Why would these ordinary
cases interest you?

466
00:33:21,712 --> 00:33:27,425
You handle serious cases like murders,
gang wars and extonions.

467
00:33:27,752 --> 00:33:32,098
Thanks... You think I'm famous...

468
00:33:33,025 --> 00:33:34,059
You wish.

469
00:33:34,158 --> 00:33:40,632
And these spoilt, rich kids you're
talking about are a lot more than that.

470
00:33:40,698 --> 00:33:42,406
They're heroes in
the eyes of the public.

471
00:33:42,501 --> 00:33:44,879
And trust me, Abhay.
This is just the beginning with them.

472
00:33:44,937 --> 00:33:49,545
Seems like you're really
close to this Ungli gang...

473
00:33:50,742 --> 00:33:51,914
Bye, Abhay.

474
00:33:57,316 --> 00:33:59,318
Well done, Abhay.

475
00:34:00,819 --> 00:34:03,163
You should write a book
on how to win girls over.

476
00:34:06,625 --> 00:34:09,469
What's the update on
your love story with Teesta?

477
00:34:10,929 --> 00:34:12,340
Nothing, man.

478
00:34:16,168 --> 00:34:17,512
Listen to me.

479
00:34:17,737 --> 00:34:19,010
Let her go.

480
00:34:21,306 --> 00:34:23,548
If you don't mind,
can I get her before letting her go?

481
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:26,290
If you're going to let her go,
then what's the point of getting her?

482
00:34:26,312 --> 00:34:27,313
Correct?

483
00:34:27,713 --> 00:34:28,919
Listen, listen.

484
00:34:28,981 --> 00:34:31,222
Abhay... listen.

485
00:34:31,483 --> 00:34:35,626
Teesta wants something
only you can give her.

486
00:34:36,255 --> 00:34:38,132
That only you have.

487
00:34:38,191 --> 00:34:39,499
Aye.

488
00:34:39,592 --> 00:34:41,071
Now you're being vulgar, Goti.

489
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:44,630
No, man, I'm talking about
information on the Ungli gang!

490
00:34:45,631 --> 00:34:46,870
Shit!

491
00:34:47,734 --> 00:34:48,838
You're right!

492
00:34:48,902 --> 00:34:50,939
Why didn't I think of that?!

493
00:34:51,871 --> 00:34:52,871
<i>Got“!</i>

494
00:34:52,904 --> 00:34:56,648
You'll get the first invite
for my wedding with Teesta.

495
00:34:57,076 --> 00:34:58,248
Thank you.

496
00:35:01,247 --> 00:35:02,817
You're driving drunk?!

497
00:35:07,186 --> 00:35:08,859
Show me your license?

498
00:35:09,022 --> 00:35:12,162
- Thank God it's only a dent
and they didn't kill someone!

499
00:35:13,026 --> 00:35:16,439
How do these underage
kids get licenses?

500
00:35:16,964 --> 00:35:18,764
The credit for that
goes to driving schools...

501
00:35:18,798 --> 00:35:21,005
and corrupt Transport officers.

502
00:35:21,634 --> 00:35:26,277
- Getting a license is as
easy as going grocery shopping.

503
00:35:26,674 --> 00:35:28,710
These corrupt officers
would give a license...

504
00:35:28,775 --> 00:35:31,085
to even a blind
man for a few bucks.

505
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:35,055
Wow, Kalim.

506
00:35:35,249 --> 00:35:36,659
What an idea!

507
00:35:45,925 --> 00:35:47,030
You move!

508
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:48,968
Smile!

509
00:36:02,009 --> 00:36:03,181
Sir.

510
00:36:08,349 --> 00:36:10,192
Sir, the photo's okay, right?

511
00:36:10,552 --> 00:36:13,259
As long as the notes are okay,
don't worry about the photo.

512
00:36:13,655 --> 00:36:15,156
You'll get the license in four days.

513
00:36:15,255 --> 00:36:17,065
Go.
- Okay, sir.

514
00:36:18,992 --> 00:36:21,598
- What's the update
on the Orion group?

515
00:36:22,162 --> 00:36:25,041
We have a few sources who
are ready to share information...

516
00:36:25,132 --> 00:36:27,203
on Agarwal's deals
and broker's information.

517
00:36:27,301 --> 00:36:28,906
The story'll be up in a few hours.

518
00:36:29,003 --> 00:36:30,003
Good.

519
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:32,879
And what about the Ungli gang?

520
00:36:34,843 --> 00:36:35,583
Uhh...

521
00:36:35,643 --> 00:36:37,053
Please tell me you have something.

522
00:36:37,311 --> 00:36:40,953
No, Manav.
We don't currently have anything.

523
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:44,389
Ya. Abhay?

524
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:50,129
This just came in the post.

525
00:36:50,191 --> 00:36:52,364
It's from the Ungli gang!

526
00:36:52,594 --> 00:36:53,594
What's in this?

527
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:56,074
Actually, it's fan mail...

528
00:36:56,164 --> 00:36:57,164
What?

529
00:36:57,165 --> 00:36:58,735
Read it and see.

530
00:36:59,401 --> 00:37:00,573
Hi, Abhay.

531
00:37:00,802 --> 00:37:02,941
Your crime reports
are quite interesting.

532
00:37:03,204 --> 00:37:06,674
Next time we give someone the finger,
you'll be the first to know.

533
00:37:06,741 --> 00:37:08,379
- Cheers. The Ungli Gang.

534
00:37:11,846 --> 00:37:13,292
Not bad, Abhay.

535
00:37:14,048 --> 00:37:15,322
Than ks, Man av.

536
00:37:21,356 --> 00:37:22,358
Abhay!

537
00:37:22,458 --> 00:37:24,266
Abhay! How could you?!

538
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:25,771
I had no idea you were so unethical.

539
00:37:25,861 --> 00:37:27,362
Besides, this was my story!

540
00:37:27,462 --> 00:37:30,341
You could have at least
come to me before going to Manav!

541
00:37:30,398 --> 00:37:32,072
We could have shown
it to Manav together!

542
00:37:32,501 --> 00:37:34,503
I've never been a fan of sharing.

543
00:37:34,804 --> 00:37:36,282
Don't be so jealous, Teesta.

544
00:37:36,571 --> 00:37:38,848
Relax, Abhay.
I'm not jealous.

545
00:37:39,607 --> 00:37:40,882
You know what.

546
00:37:41,377 --> 00:37:44,551
I could introduce
you to the Ungli Gang.

547
00:37:44,613 --> 00:37:49,494
Maybe... for my sake...
they'll drop a story or two your way?

548
00:37:49,585 --> 00:37:51,928
I don't need your
introductions or help.

549
00:37:51,986 --> 00:37:52,988
Is that clear?

550
00:37:53,055 --> 00:37:54,761
Okay. Fine!

551
00:37:55,090 --> 00:37:59,129
If you change your mind,
don't hesitate to ask...

552
00:38:07,303 --> 00:38:09,249
Goti, bro...

553
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:11,680
Mission successful.

554
00:38:28,859 --> 00:38:30,030
Hi!

555
00:39:22,246 --> 00:39:23,519
Yes, Gadkari!

556
00:39:23,813 --> 00:39:24,813
He's blind.

557
00:39:25,583 --> 00:39:27,118
But you don't worry.

558
00:39:27,752 --> 00:39:30,197
He has a license.

559
00:39:30,955 --> 00:39:32,126
From you!

560
00:39:34,091 --> 00:39:40,736
He is capable of driving on the streets,
according to your Transport officers.

561
00:39:42,733 --> 00:39:43,438
But!

562
00:39:43,534 --> 00:39:46,413
You left out the most important
pan before giving him the license.

563
00:39:47,305 --> 00:39:48,375
What?

564
00:39:48,906 --> 00:39:50,544
Test drive!

565
00:39:51,207 --> 00:39:53,586
But we can fix that.

566
00:39:54,679 --> 00:39:56,920
Yadav is going to
take you on a test drive.

567
00:39:56,981 --> 00:39:58,324
Yes, sir!

568
00:39:58,783 --> 00:39:59,783
Here are the car keys!

569
00:39:59,784 --> 00:40:01,923
One minute, sir.
Let me keep my cane away.

570
00:40:03,921 --> 00:40:04,921
Relax.

571
00:40:07,491 --> 00:40:08,491
Higher!

572
00:40:08,993 --> 00:40:10,597
To the left!

573
00:40:10,795 --> 00:40:12,332
A little lower!

574
00:40:13,397 --> 00:40:14,569
Flash some light!

575
00:40:14,665 --> 00:40:15,667
Light?!

576
00:40:15,734 --> 00:40:16,734
Idiot!

577
00:40:16,834 --> 00:40:18,473
You can't see!
He can't see?!

578
00:40:18,804 --> 00:40:19,907
Sorry.

579
00:40:20,571 --> 00:40:21,915
Drive, drive!

580
00:40:24,108 --> 00:40:25,213
Sorry, sir!

581
00:40:25,277 --> 00:40:26,380
Sorry, sir!

582
00:40:26,444 --> 00:40:28,049
It's my first time!

583
00:40:28,447 --> 00:40:29,754
Should I switch on the AC?

584
00:40:32,283 --> 00:40:34,161
Stop! Enough! Switch it off!

585
00:40:34,252 --> 00:40:36,823
What 'ahh'?! Stop it!

586
00:40:54,673 --> 00:40:57,449
Save me, God... Save me!!!

587
00:40:57,943 --> 00:40:59,183
Look in front!

588
00:41:02,114 --> 00:41:04,025
I gave you the license?

589
00:41:04,216 --> 00:41:06,594
Stop the car! Stop the car!

590
00:41:09,122 --> 00:41:10,293
NO!!!

591
00:41:11,289 --> 00:41:15,261
Stop the car!

592
00:41:27,507 --> 00:41:28,678
Reverse.

593
00:41:45,291 --> 00:41:46,497
What do I do with
these contact lenses?

594
00:41:46,559 --> 00:41:47,662
You can keep it.

595
00:41:47,927 --> 00:41:50,047
I've been struggling in
the film industry for so long.

596
00:41:50,296 --> 00:41:51,775
No one's ever given me a role.

597
00:41:52,165 --> 00:41:54,873
Tomorrow onwards,
you'll be flooded with offers.

598
00:41:55,401 --> 00:41:57,745
Every news channel
will have your face on it.

599
00:41:57,870 --> 00:41:58,905
Thank you, sir.

600
00:41:59,172 --> 00:42:00,412
Thank you.

601
00:42:32,305 --> 00:42:33,751
Shhh!

602
00:42:34,707 --> 00:42:37,450
I have a gift for you from Abhay!

603
00:42:38,712 --> 00:42:41,886
I'm going to take
my hand off your mouth.

604
00:42:42,683 --> 00:42:44,025
Don't scream.

605
00:42:44,317 --> 00:42:45,661
Okay?

606
00:42:52,626 --> 00:42:53,934
Enjoy the CD!

607
00:42:54,795 --> 00:42:57,002
And don't forget to thank Abhay.

608
00:43:11,479 --> 00:43:12,821
In today's breaking news...

609
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:17,227
the Ungli gang's latest
stunt has shaken up the country...

610
00:43:17,318 --> 00:43:19,388
by exposing the
partnership between...

611
00:43:19,453 --> 00:43:23,596
Transport officials and
driving school in License corruption.

612
00:43:23,691 --> 00:43:27,537
By using a blind man,
they've opened our eyes.

613
00:43:27,595 --> 00:43:33,409
The illegal license issued,
endangers the lives of citizens.

614
00:43:33,935 --> 00:43:37,814
The legal driving age is 18,
to avoid that danger.

615
00:43:38,106 --> 00:43:39,106
Nice!

616
00:43:39,107 --> 00:43:40,279
Thank you!

617
00:43:42,544 --> 00:43:43,920
Wow...

618
00:43:44,712 --> 00:43:46,020
You're rocking!

619
00:43:46,947 --> 00:43:49,554
The biggest breaking news
is that Manav is happy with me.

620
00:43:50,652 --> 00:43:55,260
Someone asked me
to thank you for the CD.

621
00:43:58,192 --> 00:43:59,967
Thank you, Abhay.
It was very sweet of you.

622
00:44:00,061 --> 00:44:05,102
What can I say... It's nice to see
a beautiful face on the morning news.

623
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:11,107
Well... if you're not satisfied
with just looking at the face on TV...

624
00:44:11,707 --> 00:44:14,107
then maybe you can look
at it in a coffee shop after work?

625
00:44:14,577 --> 00:44:15,611
Really?

626
00:44:16,244 --> 00:44:17,553
Really.

627
00:44:20,049 --> 00:44:22,255
- You're not as bad as I thought.

628
00:44:22,483 --> 00:44:24,463
I can be veryjudgmental sometimes.

629
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:28,597
Did your Ungli gang member
ask you to apologize, too?

630
00:44:29,491 --> 00:44:30,730
Shut up!

631
00:44:48,711 --> 00:44:50,452
How did you know I would come?

632
00:44:51,213 --> 00:44:52,817
I've known you since you were a kid.

633
00:44:54,316 --> 00:44:56,489
You always liked free things...

634
00:44:57,019 --> 00:44:59,192
whether that's a lollipop...
or whiskey.

635
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:02,697
I've also known you since childhood.

636
00:45:04,593 --> 00:45:09,474
This free whiskey
could really cost me.

637
00:45:10,967 --> 00:45:13,880
What happened of your
college hostel girlfriend?

638
00:45:14,904 --> 00:45:16,885
We broke up six months ago.

639
00:45:17,507 --> 00:45:18,678
Then that night?

640
00:45:19,074 --> 00:45:21,520
I'd gone to give her something
I'd forgotten to give.

641
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:22,880
What?

642
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:26,189
Good bye kiss.

643
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:32,791
This badboy image of yours
can fool others... but not me.

644
00:45:33,356 --> 00:45:35,063
There's still some good in you.

645
00:45:35,258 --> 00:45:36,430
WOW!

646
00:45:37,092 --> 00:45:38,538
I knew there were
X rays for your body...

647
00:45:38,595 --> 00:45:40,403
but you can X
ray even my character!

648
00:45:40,897 --> 00:45:42,171
Very good.

649
00:45:43,198 --> 00:45:45,873
What do you think of this Ungli gang?

650
00:45:47,304 --> 00:45:48,510
Let's see.

651
00:45:49,171 --> 00:45:50,549
I'm jealous of them.

652
00:45:51,107 --> 00:45:53,951
We've been called to sing
at the party, but can't sing.

653
00:45:54,611 --> 00:45:57,251
We're the police and we
get no credit for doing our job.

654
00:45:57,614 --> 00:46:00,060
<i>No one can do our job besides us.</i>

655
00:46:01,586 --> 00:46:04,156
Lazy and ineffective people
have no right to anything.

656
00:46:05,255 --> 00:46:08,327
The laziest person in the
world is imparting wisdom to me.

657
00:46:09,059 --> 00:46:12,438
Sitting in a bar,
drinking free whiskey is of no use.

658
00:46:12,929 --> 00:46:15,739
If you want work, I'll give you work.

659
00:46:16,066 --> 00:46:18,205
And that is to catch the Ungli gang.

660
00:46:18,668 --> 00:46:20,670
You've been kicked off the bomb squad.

661
00:46:20,770 --> 00:46:23,717
Join me and you'll
report only to me, Nikhil.

662
00:46:26,310 --> 00:46:28,118
Why are you doing me this courtesy?

663
00:46:28,946 --> 00:46:33,360
You don't look it but
you're just like them.

664
00:46:36,419 --> 00:46:37,728
I was right.

665
00:46:38,222 --> 00:46:39,529
About what?

666
00:46:40,458 --> 00:46:43,905
This whiskey really did cost me.

667
00:46:52,236 --> 00:46:53,681
- Have you thought of a plan?

668
00:46:53,771 --> 00:46:55,307
- The plan is exactly like theirs.

669
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:59,381
We have to find something
that's bothering the public.

670
00:47:00,344 --> 00:47:03,621
Like these sidewalks...
and their potholes.

671
00:47:04,648 --> 00:47:08,425
The Municipal Corporation has dug up
wherever and whatever they wanted to.

672
00:47:08,853 --> 00:47:10,333
Except for the sidewalk...

673
00:47:10,822 --> 00:47:14,394
in front of the Municipal
Commissioner Pradhan's house.

674
00:47:14,458 --> 00:47:18,565
Which, incidentally, he fixed up
last week... with the public's money.

675
00:47:19,264 --> 00:47:22,302
And all for his son's
wedding in 3 days.

676
00:47:23,035 --> 00:47:24,604
What exactly do you want to do?

677
00:47:25,737 --> 00:47:28,274
Just... want to greet
the wedding guests...

678
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:30,911
with something
other than refreshments.

679
00:47:31,343 --> 00:47:34,654
Just give me 3 months, an allowance...

680
00:47:34,913 --> 00:47:39,622
admission in University
and the freedom to my job, my way.

681
00:47:40,285 --> 00:47:44,199
This information should
only stay between us.

682
00:47:45,623 --> 00:47:47,035
What information, sir?

683
00:49:04,437 --> 00:49:05,745
- Good Morning and welcome!

684
00:49:06,172 --> 00:49:09,985
- The Ungli Gang presents an
explosive wedding video just for you.

685
00:49:10,177 --> 00:49:12,851
This video has music,
playing and wedding guests.

686
00:49:13,213 --> 00:49:14,350
We played the music.

687
00:49:14,547 --> 00:49:17,460
Mr. Pradhan, our Municipal
Commissioner, is the one who got played.

688
00:49:17,684 --> 00:49:19,130
And you all are the wedding guests.

689
00:49:19,819 --> 00:49:22,891
But don't worry about giving
the bride and groom a gift.

690
00:49:23,356 --> 00:49:24,734
You've seen the gift...

691
00:49:25,058 --> 00:49:28,232
the potholes in front of
Mr. Pradhan's house...

692
00:49:28,862 --> 00:49:33,868
which the Municipal Corporation
had fixed with your hard earned money.

693
00:49:36,069 --> 00:49:38,414
Perhaps Mr. Pradhan
will now realize...

694
00:49:38,738 --> 00:49:43,620
he who dig holes for others,
often falls into it himself.

695
00:49:45,612 --> 00:49:49,788
The Municipal Corporation
fill their pockets than the potholes.

696
00:49:50,017 --> 00:49:54,625
It's his son's wedding and
we're paying to fix his sidewalk?!

697
00:49:55,456 --> 00:49:57,993
Ungli Gang, we love you!!!

698
00:50:09,003 --> 00:50:09,912
Hello?

699
00:50:09,970 --> 00:50:11,278
How'd you like the explosion?

700
00:50:11,538 --> 00:50:14,644
You're creating explosions there,
and we're feeling the tremors here.

701
00:50:14,942 --> 00:50:16,249
Are you crazy?

702
00:50:16,510 --> 00:50:19,491
It's not like you've
hired me to sing prayers, sir.

703
00:50:20,982 --> 00:50:23,689
I've been getting
the hiccups all day...

704
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:28,498
Somewhere in this city,
the Ungli gang is thinking about me.

705
00:50:34,595 --> 00:50:37,474
- Dear Ungli Gang, here is an
explosive wedding video just for you.

706
00:50:37,665 --> 00:50:40,612
- This video has music,
playing and wedding guests.

707
00:50:40,668 --> 00:50:41,702
- I played the music...

708
00:50:41,769 --> 00:50:45,046
This scoundrel is using
our name and taking the credit!

709
00:50:45,373 --> 00:50:47,182
It's not cool!

710
00:50:49,143 --> 00:50:50,884
Whoever he is, he's very intelligent.

711
00:50:51,613 --> 00:50:54,253
Question is, why is he doing this?!

712
00:50:54,782 --> 00:50:56,386
To be famous, why else?!

713
00:50:56,651 --> 00:50:58,187
No!

714
00:50:58,353 --> 00:51:00,765
This isn't going
to benefit him at all!

715
00:51:00,822 --> 00:51:02,563
He's using the Ungli Gang's name!

716
00:51:02,623 --> 00:51:04,330
We're the ones getting the credit!

717
00:51:04,525 --> 00:51:09,305
- Those who dig holes for others,
often fall into it himself.

718
00:51:12,468 --> 00:51:15,506
He's even been smart
about his imitation!

719
00:51:15,937 --> 00:51:17,815
Hey, guys... come check this out.

720
00:51:17,873 --> 00:51:18,977
Come, come...

721
00:51:21,844 --> 00:51:23,151
Watch carefully.

722
00:51:23,211 --> 00:51:26,124
The graffiti on the
wall is exactly like ours.

723
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:29,420
But if you zoom in...
there's something written there.

724
00:51:30,419 --> 00:51:31,726
11...

725
00:51:31,986 --> 00:51:33,091
Do Tanki, C.S. T.

726
00:51:33,188 --> 00:51:35,098
11 pm, Wednesday.

727
00:51:36,926 --> 00:51:39,429
This is an address...
near C. S.T Station.

728
00:51:58,113 --> 00:51:58,921
Yeah, Goti.

729
00:51:59,014 --> 00:52:02,622
- He's been waiting for two hours...
he still isn't tired.

730
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:05,859
He has to tire
eventually and come down.

731
00:52:15,731 --> 00:52:17,142
Okay, he's coming down.

732
00:52:33,917 --> 00:52:36,557
I knew you'll would come to meet me.

733
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:38,797
Who are you?

734
00:52:39,556 --> 00:52:41,729
I'm a fan of yours.

735
00:52:42,425 --> 00:52:44,598
What you'll are doing is correct.

736
00:52:44,894 --> 00:52:46,805
I want to join your gang.

737
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:50,607
You think this a club that
we can give you membership to?

738
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:52,202
Come on, guys!

739
00:52:52,602 --> 00:52:55,674
You'll saw how I taught
BK Pradhan a lesson, right?!!

740
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:59,215
I gave such an audition
for your gang...

741
00:52:59,310 --> 00:53:02,519
that the audience would
immediately know it's you!

742
00:53:03,179 --> 00:53:04,419
Yes...

743
00:53:05,816 --> 00:53:08,592
but we don't need a new partner.

744
00:53:11,121 --> 00:53:15,432
Look, I know it's not
easy to just trust me.

745
00:53:16,393 --> 00:53:17,998
My name is Nikhil Abhyankar.

746
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:20,903
I'm a law student
at the Mumbai University.

747
00:53:21,298 --> 00:53:24,177
And I want to join your
fight against corruption.

748
00:53:24,468 --> 00:53:27,745
Finally there's someone
who's fighting the system!

749
00:53:27,805 --> 00:53:29,284
And is winning!

750
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:31,519
Nice speech.

751
00:53:31,674 --> 00:53:34,746
But the answer is still no.

752
00:53:35,813 --> 00:53:37,553
Then why did you come here?

753
00:53:39,183 --> 00:53:41,060
To give you a warning.

754
00:53:41,685 --> 00:53:43,426
Go study law quietly.

755
00:53:43,487 --> 00:53:46,400
Don't try to take the
law in your hands like us.

756
00:54:05,410 --> 00:54:06,547
Andheri?

757
00:54:06,644 --> 00:54:08,244
Where do you need to go?
- Andheri, west?

758
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:10,658
It's too nearby.
Long fares only.

759
00:54:13,918 --> 00:54:15,988
Andheri, sir?

760
00:54:22,059 --> 00:54:23,539
Andheri?

761
00:54:23,595 --> 00:54:25,734
Where in Andheri?
- Andheri, west.

762
00:54:26,698 --> 00:54:28,370
Too close by, madam.

763
00:54:28,934 --> 00:54:31,778
Please, sir. Look at how
much stuff I have to carry.

764
00:54:31,903 --> 00:54:32,779
Please?

765
00:54:32,838 --> 00:54:34,282
It'll cost you double the fare.

766
00:54:35,173 --> 00:54:36,379
Why double fare?

767
00:54:36,441 --> 00:54:39,183
That's how much it costs...
If you want to go, let me know.

768
00:54:39,277 --> 00:54:40,847
Or find someone else.

769
00:54:44,382 --> 00:54:45,986
Okay, come.

770
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:52,734
Mom, what are you doing?

771
00:54:53,392 --> 00:54:55,464
Get down.
- There you are.

772
00:54:55,561 --> 00:54:56,595
Good.

773
00:54:56,661 --> 00:54:58,038
You do this.

774
00:54:58,096 --> 00:55:00,201
My feet are paining.

775
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:03,270
What happened?

776
00:55:04,504 --> 00:55:05,675
I'm getting old!

777
00:55:06,938 --> 00:55:10,614
Not to mention, I was looking
for a rickshaw all evening.

778
00:55:10,776 --> 00:55:13,848
I had to wait for an hour!
You should have called me!

779
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:16,056
I would have picked
you up on the bike!

780
00:55:16,147 --> 00:55:19,391
No, no.
Why should I disturb you at work?

781
00:55:20,453 --> 00:55:24,764
Nikhil... something needs to be done
about these bully rickshaw drivers.

782
00:55:24,923 --> 00:55:27,200
They're only interested in long fares.

783
00:55:27,325 --> 00:55:29,738
Don't care about senior citizens.

784
00:55:30,029 --> 00:55:33,703
But, Nikhil, today I have noted
down the number of this rickshaw.

785
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:35,720
Where did you take this rickshaw from?

786
00:55:41,641 --> 00:55:42,847
Where do you want to go?

787
00:55:42,942 --> 00:55:43,942
Andheri.

788
00:55:44,076 --> 00:55:45,077
Not Andheri, sir.

789
00:55:45,144 --> 00:55:46,487
Only long fares.

790
00:55:48,347 --> 00:55:50,054
What the hell are you doing?!

791
00:55:50,349 --> 00:55:52,296
Will you go to Delhi?
- What?

792
00:55:53,286 --> 00:55:54,492
- Drive quietly.

793
00:55:54,553 --> 00:55:56,260
- Or else you'll reach
heaven before Delhi.

794
00:55:56,389 --> 00:55:57,389
Stan.

795
00:56:01,028 --> 00:56:03,701
It was a mistake, sir... Forgive me!

796
00:56:03,963 --> 00:56:04,874
Keep going.

797
00:56:04,932 --> 00:56:08,038
Yes... Please forgive me.

798
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:09,704
Look ahead!

799
00:56:09,769 --> 00:56:11,305
- Forgive me, sir.

800
00:56:12,038 --> 00:56:14,144
- It was a mistake, sir.
Forgive me!

801
00:56:14,241 --> 00:56:15,844
- Turn and stop here.

802
00:56:16,343 --> 00:56:18,117
- Stop here.

803
00:56:21,347 --> 00:56:22,952
- Open that door.

804
00:56:24,317 --> 00:56:25,558
<i>'</i> Open it!

805
00:56:28,255 --> 00:56:29,928
- Take this rickshaw inside.

806
00:56:30,023 --> 00:56:32,401
Sir, please...
- Sit.

807
00:56:34,061 --> 00:56:35,972
Let me go, sir...

808
00:56:39,598 --> 00:56:41,772
Sir, please, sir...

809
00:56:41,968 --> 00:56:44,642
Sir, let me go...

810
00:56:49,143 --> 00:56:51,123
Only long fares, right?!

811
00:56:52,546 --> 00:56:55,050
Here's a long fare.
Go to Delhi!

812
00:57:15,268 --> 00:57:16,475
- Ghanshyam Tiwari.

813
00:57:16,571 --> 00:57:17,446
That rickshaw driver...

814
00:57:17,504 --> 00:57:20,576
who was sent by the Ungli
gang to Delhi for a 'long fare'.

815
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:25,556
He was found with his autorickshaw
on a Delhi-Mumbai goods' train.

816
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:28,456
This driver only went as far as Delhi.

817
00:57:28,516 --> 00:57:31,725
If the autorickshaw drivers
don't stop harassing the common man...

818
00:57:31,819 --> 00:57:34,026
and don't stop being
greedy for long fares...

819
00:57:34,355 --> 00:57:41,102
- next time we'll send them
a lot further than Delhi!

820
00:57:42,129 --> 00:57:45,372
The Ungli gang has done
the Traffic Police's job.

821
00:57:45,434 --> 00:57:47,777
Hope these rickshaw
guys learn their lesson.

822
00:57:47,835 --> 00:57:52,147
They act like doing their
job is a favour to the citizens.

823
00:57:52,206 --> 00:57:54,243
It's a good lesson
for rickshaw drivers.

824
00:57:54,308 --> 00:57:56,015
They have no manners.

825
00:57:56,110 --> 00:57:58,147
The Ungli Gang has given
them such a long fare...

826
00:57:58,246 --> 00:58:00,818
that the next time they ask for
one... they'll rethink it 10 times.

827
00:58:00,883 --> 00:58:04,160
We autorickshaw drivers
will not be secure...

828
00:58:04,352 --> 00:58:08,858
until the culprits are caught!

829
00:58:09,491 --> 00:58:11,527
This guy wants to meet us again.

830
00:58:11,926 --> 00:58:13,201
Monday.

831
00:58:13,696 --> 00:58:16,302
Same time, same place.

832
00:58:19,134 --> 00:58:21,444
Doesn't seem like he's going to stop.

833
00:58:21,837 --> 00:58:25,808
Have to admit...
he has a really wicked mind.

834
00:58:25,908 --> 00:58:26,783
Truly.

835
00:58:26,841 --> 00:58:29,515
Sending the rickshaw driver
with his rickshaw to Delhi...

836
00:58:30,044 --> 00:58:31,649
What a badass thing to do.

837
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:34,351
Until yesterday, he was our fan...

838
00:58:34,683 --> 00:58:37,323
now it seems like
you'll are his fans.

839
00:58:37,386 --> 00:58:39,023
Next you'll say he should
be a pan of our group.

840
00:58:39,121 --> 00:58:41,897
What's your problem, Abhay?
Why are you so scared?

841
00:58:42,124 --> 00:58:45,196
Do you think someone new will
endanger your importance in the team?

842
00:58:45,527 --> 00:58:47,507
This is your insecurity!

843
00:58:48,630 --> 00:58:50,906
I'm not talking about my insecurity.

844
00:58:51,434 --> 00:58:53,413
I'm talking about
the security of us all.

845
00:58:53,535 --> 00:58:55,981
What Nikhil said that night is true.

846
00:58:56,105 --> 00:58:57,743
This isn't our fight alone.

847
00:58:57,806 --> 00:58:59,114
So, what do you want?

848
00:59:01,810 --> 00:59:03,848
- Whatever.
- What do you mean whatever?

849
00:59:04,780 --> 00:59:07,057
We should give him a chance.

850
00:59:14,556 --> 00:59:15,556
Fine.

851
00:59:16,092 --> 00:59:20,767
But let's find out if Mumbai University
student Nikhil Abhyankar is...

852
00:59:21,064 --> 00:59:23,134
a soldier or a problem.

853
00:59:45,288 --> 00:59:48,929
- Seems that whatever
Mr. Nikhil Abhyankar said is true.

854
00:59:49,325 --> 00:59:51,327
So. Do you want to meet him?

855
00:59:59,904 --> 01:00:03,613
- Despite our warnings,
you didn't change...

856
01:00:04,374 --> 01:00:07,082
People who try to change me,
usually end up changing themselves.

857
01:00:10,447 --> 01:00:11,984
This isn't a game.

858
01:00:12,283 --> 01:00:13,625
If you get caught, you'll go to jail.

859
01:00:13,717 --> 01:00:17,529
Gandhi didn't wait to claim salt.

860
01:00:18,722 --> 01:00:20,702
Only difference is... he used peace.

861
01:00:20,791 --> 01:00:22,099
We use force.

862
01:00:22,592 --> 01:00:25,403
I've never met anyone
as crazy or stubborn as you.

863
01:00:26,162 --> 01:00:28,904
Just think that
I'm a shadow of you'll.

864
01:00:33,037 --> 01:00:35,312
Remember one thing.

865
01:00:36,307 --> 01:00:38,514
If you betray us...

866
01:00:40,344 --> 01:00:41,982
I'll kill you.

867
01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:43,399
I won't give you the opportunity.

868
01:00:43,781 --> 01:00:45,124
I like living.

869
01:00:48,852 --> 01:00:50,560
Welcome to the gang.

870
01:00:52,089 --> 01:00:54,535
The official Ungli gang.

871
01:00:55,159 --> 01:00:59,266
Kalim, Goti, Maya...

872
01:01:01,332 --> 01:01:02,903
Abhay.

873
01:01:04,034 --> 01:01:05,446
There's another...

874
01:01:06,171 --> 01:01:08,447
who isn't with us today.

875
01:01:27,025 --> 01:01:28,095
Nikhil...

876
01:01:30,428 --> 01:01:31,566
meet Ricky.

877
01:01:38,703 --> 01:01:42,241
Ricky is Maya's older brother.

878
01:01:44,542 --> 01:01:47,183
We first met him at his gym.

879
01:01:52,083 --> 01:01:56,464
- He used to make us do
these strange, scary exercises.

880
01:01:57,389 --> 01:01:58,993
Crossfit.

881
01:02:16,608 --> 01:02:17,849
- He's a wonderful guy...

882
01:02:18,077 --> 01:02:21,081
but super strict
when it came to exercise.

883
01:02:21,247 --> 01:02:24,251
- He wouldn't let us go
until someone vomited.

884
01:02:49,041 --> 01:02:53,922
- As we built our bodies...
we formed a friendship.

885
01:02:57,650 --> 01:02:59,221
If I tried to bunk...

886
01:02:59,386 --> 01:03:04,699
he would come home and
drag me out of bed to go workout.

887
01:03:05,292 --> 01:03:07,100
He, himself,
used to sleep like the dead.

888
01:03:08,095 --> 01:03:09,767
Even on Brother's Day.

889
01:03:10,029 --> 01:03:11,600
- Wake up!

890
01:03:11,932 --> 01:03:13,433
- How much can you sleep?

891
01:03:14,101 --> 01:03:15,307
Come on, I want my gift.

892
01:03:15,401 --> 01:03:17,882
Letting you celebrate Brother's Day
is my gift to you.

893
01:03:19,104 --> 01:03:20,104
Give me my gift.

894
01:03:20,107 --> 01:03:22,416
Give it or else
I'll take it from your wallet!

895
01:03:24,478 --> 01:03:26,355
Then the incident happened...

896
01:03:27,114 --> 01:03:29,685
which caused Ricky
to fall into a slumber so deep...

897
01:03:30,550 --> 01:03:33,292
that he still hasn't woken up.

898
01:03:33,653 --> 01:03:35,360
- Can't you understand?

899
01:03:35,622 --> 01:03:37,192
- Can't you see?

900
01:03:37,290 --> 01:03:38,496
Didn't you see the car?

901
01:03:38,692 --> 01:03:41,172
I've been honking for such
a long time, you couldn't see the car?

902
01:03:41,228 --> 01:03:41,797
Look...

903
01:03:41,862 --> 01:03:43,068
Listen, old man!

904
01:03:43,163 --> 01:03:45,109
I will turn you into a
piece of garbage like your car.

905
01:03:45,198 --> 01:03:46,404
What?!

906
01:03:46,501 --> 01:03:48,621
You overtake from the wrong
side and then make noise?!

907
01:03:48,702 --> 01:03:51,945
Won't take me too long to mess you up,
do you understand?!

908
01:03:52,038 --> 01:03:54,040
Stop, stop, stop...

909
01:03:54,574 --> 01:03:56,417
Aren't you ashamed to
be harassing an old man?!

910
01:03:56,476 --> 01:03:58,251
What, man?
Is he your father or something?!

911
01:03:58,311 --> 01:03:59,120
Leave it now, come on!

912
01:03:59,247 --> 01:04:01,454
Get out of here,
or I'll smash your face.

913
01:04:02,749 --> 01:04:04,126
Aye, boss!

914
01:04:05,852 --> 01:04:07,024
He'll kill you!

915
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:09,293
You want to create trouble?

916
01:04:13,494 --> 01:04:14,694
You've come to get a beating?!

917
01:04:18,331 --> 01:04:19,242
Come on, come on, come on!

918
01:04:19,367 --> 01:04:20,505
Let's go!

919
01:04:21,535 --> 01:04:23,072
What are you just standing there for?!

920
01:04:23,137 --> 01:04:24,013
- Help him!

921
01:04:24,071 --> 01:04:25,709
- No, sir! This is a police case!

922
01:04:25,773 --> 01:04:27,309
- Help me!

923
01:04:27,741 --> 01:04:29,380
- I'll take him to the hospital!

924
01:04:31,144 --> 01:04:31,850
Doctor!

925
01:04:31,946 --> 01:04:33,016
How's Ricky?!

926
01:04:33,281 --> 01:04:34,419
I'm sorry.

927
01:04:34,916 --> 01:04:38,159
He has massive head injuries
and internal hemorrhaging.

928
01:04:38,286 --> 01:04:39,697
He's in a coma.

929
01:04:49,097 --> 01:04:51,872
- It's difficult to predict
anything in coma patients.

930
01:04:52,033 --> 01:04:55,014
- He could wake up tomorrow...
or take years.

931
01:04:55,437 --> 01:04:58,145
But everything happened
before my eyes.

932
01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:00,241
Sir, they hit him with a cricket bat.

933
01:05:00,308 --> 01:05:01,686
He's suffered life
a life threatening attack.

934
01:05:01,744 --> 01:05:03,279
How can you not file an FIR?!

935
01:05:03,377 --> 01:05:05,448
We have the car number.

936
01:05:05,513 --> 01:05:09,290
I told you already!
I don't want to file your FIR.

937
01:05:09,350 --> 01:05:10,921
Don't irritate me unnecessarily.

938
01:05:10,986 --> 01:05:12,225
Get out!

939
01:05:13,388 --> 01:05:17,029
When they found out
I was ajournalist, they agreed.

940
01:05:17,359 --> 01:05:18,803
Every citizen has the
right to file a complain.

941
01:05:18,860 --> 01:05:21,670
I'll put you all on
the front page if you don't!

942
01:05:31,773 --> 01:05:35,482
Then we found out,
Anshuman Dayal, who hit Ricky...

943
01:05:35,577 --> 01:05:40,083
his father, BR Dayal,
was well known in the police department.

944
01:05:40,749 --> 01:05:43,093
He was a bookie for
the whole police force.

945
01:05:52,961 --> 01:05:53,701
Hello?

946
01:05:53,762 --> 01:05:57,939
Mr. Joshi, why are you
trying to be a hero at this age?

947
01:05:58,034 --> 01:06:01,208
Enjoy the few years you have left...

948
01:06:01,337 --> 01:06:02,974
Take the case back.
- Who is this?

949
01:06:03,072 --> 01:06:04,984
I'm going to report you to the police.

950
01:06:05,073 --> 01:06:08,452
Mr. Joshi... you don't understand.

951
01:06:08,977 --> 01:06:10,651
This is the police.

952
01:06:11,480 --> 01:06:13,791
If you value your wellbeing
then take this case-

953
01:06:16,953 --> 01:06:18,260
Who was that, Grandpa?

954
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:19,994
No one, dear.

955
01:06:20,356 --> 01:06:21,858
You go to college.

956
01:06:22,492 --> 01:06:23,902
Bye, Grandpa!

957
01:06:27,897 --> 01:06:29,604
Let's meet his grand daughter...

958
01:06:36,906 --> 01:06:38,442
It was juice this time.

959
01:06:38,541 --> 01:06:41,112
Next time, it'll be acid.
Tell your grandfather!

960
01:06:41,210 --> 01:06:42,018
Understood?!

961
01:06:42,111 --> 01:06:43,385
Let's go.

962
01:06:48,184 --> 01:06:51,598
Mr. Joshi, is my client...

963
01:06:52,221 --> 01:06:55,361
Mr. Anshuman Dayal,
the one who hit Ricky?

964
01:06:59,562 --> 01:07:00,564
No.

965
01:07:01,764 --> 01:07:03,574
- I don't remember.

966
01:07:04,968 --> 01:07:06,846
- It was dark...

967
01:07:07,438 --> 01:07:09,384
I couldn't see him properly.

968
01:07:09,540 --> 01:07:12,987
Your Honour, Mr. Joshi has
given a statement to the police.

969
01:07:13,644 --> 01:07:16,921
I think someone is threatening him.

970
01:07:18,749 --> 01:07:19,749
No.

971
01:07:21,017 --> 01:07:24,123
I really don't remember.

972
01:07:26,457 --> 01:07:28,061
I made a mistake.

973
01:07:29,159 --> 01:07:31,070
Without him, we can't do anything!

974
01:07:31,328 --> 01:07:32,864
How could he do this to us?

975
01:07:33,162 --> 01:07:35,643
- Until yesterday, he was with us.

976
01:07:38,903 --> 01:07:40,439
Why did you lie?

977
01:07:41,605 --> 01:07:45,075
I can sacrifice my
life for the truth...

978
01:07:45,642 --> 01:07:51,457
but not that of my
grand daughter and family.

979
01:07:52,449 --> 01:07:57,331
A common man cannot fight
the corrupt system here.

980
01:07:59,056 --> 01:08:00,900
And if they do...

981
01:08:02,326 --> 01:08:03,965
they cannot win.

982
01:08:32,891 --> 01:08:36,338
I would have smashed that Anshuman's
face if you hadn't stopped me.

983
01:08:36,394 --> 01:08:38,203
And then jail for
the next five years?!

984
01:08:38,296 --> 01:08:41,106
So what?! Should we sit
here with our hands folded?!

985
01:08:41,934 --> 01:08:45,177
We should stop Ricky's
life support system.

986
01:08:47,305 --> 01:08:48,716
You want us to kill Ricky?

987
01:08:49,574 --> 01:08:51,815
What will keeping him
alive like this achieve?

988
01:08:53,813 --> 01:08:55,257
Dayal won.

989
01:08:55,914 --> 01:08:57,826
He lost to the corrupt system.

990
01:08:59,084 --> 01:09:00,189
<i>O</i> kaY-

991
01:09:01,820 --> 01:09:02,820
Come on.

992
01:09:02,822 --> 01:09:05,666
Abhay...
- Let's go kill Ricky.

993
01:09:08,126 --> 01:09:09,126
Come on!

994
01:09:09,128 --> 01:09:10,129
Let's go!

995
01:09:12,565 --> 01:09:14,066
Do it.
- Abhay!

996
01:09:14,165 --> 01:09:15,270
Do it!

997
01:09:18,104 --> 01:09:19,515
You heard Joshi.

998
01:09:19,572 --> 01:09:22,576
A common man cannot fight
the corrupt system here.

999
01:09:22,642 --> 01:09:24,087
He was right.

1000
01:09:24,143 --> 01:09:25,918
Because the common
man has to follow rules.

1001
01:09:25,978 --> 01:09:27,719
He has to stay within the law.

1002
01:09:27,813 --> 01:09:30,794
Those laws and rules that
criminals break whenever they want.

1003
01:09:33,586 --> 01:09:35,122
We'll do the same thing.

1004
01:09:35,588 --> 01:09:36,999
We'll break the law.

1005
01:09:37,123 --> 01:09:39,125
So that these people
learn to respect the law.

1006
01:09:39,192 --> 01:09:40,637
What are you saying?

1007
01:09:41,127 --> 01:09:43,664
You want to us to become
criminals and delinquents?

1008
01:09:43,829 --> 01:09:44,829
No.

1009
01:09:45,298 --> 01:09:47,005
I want us to be gang...

1010
01:09:47,266 --> 01:09:51,942
of ordinary people who fight
forjustice in an extraordinary way.

1011
01:09:53,205 --> 01:09:57,779
Because when the right
and wrong way don't work...

1012
01:09:57,877 --> 01:10:00,222
you have to take the middle road.

1013
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:03,954
- It's time we show the
system the middle finger.

1014
01:10:06,820 --> 01:10:08,959
That night, the Ungli gang was formed.

1015
01:10:12,459 --> 01:10:14,871
And thanks to Maya,
you are now one of us.

1016
01:10:16,196 --> 01:10:16,832
Maya?

1017
01:10:16,929 --> 01:10:19,569
Yeah... she was very impressed by you.

1018
01:10:48,829 --> 01:10:52,174
"Oh, my sweet affliction..."

1019
01:10:53,835 --> 01:10:57,680
"My heart melts when I see your eyes."

1020
01:10:58,238 --> 01:11:02,210
"Oh, my sweet affliction..."

1021
01:11:03,244 --> 01:11:06,884
"You've taken over my heart."

1022
01:11:07,347 --> 01:11:11,387
"When you speak."

1023
01:11:11,986 --> 01:11:15,900
"It's like a prayer to me."

1024
01:11:16,289 --> 01:11:20,466
"This love, yours and mine
ls beyond divinity."

1025
01:11:20,962 --> 01:11:25,671
"This love, yours and mine
ls a sweet affliction."

1026
01:11:25,766 --> 01:11:29,977
"This love, yours and mine
ls beyond divinity."

1027
01:11:31,138 --> 01:11:33,243
I can't figure it out.

1028
01:11:33,474 --> 01:11:34,578
What?

1029
01:11:35,009 --> 01:11:36,750
How is Rapunzel still single?

1030
01:11:37,980 --> 01:11:41,290
I guess I still haven't
met my vine-climbing hero.

1031
01:11:43,551 --> 01:11:45,360
Will this Hero Honda riding hero do?

1032
01:11:46,287 --> 01:11:49,929
"Sweet affliction..."

1033
01:11:51,058 --> 01:11:54,562
"Sweet affliction..."

1034
01:12:17,219 --> 01:12:20,723
"Sweet affliction..."

1035
01:12:24,326 --> 01:12:30,766
"Your smile showers
light on the world."

1036
01:12:33,669 --> 01:12:40,416
"And you teach
my soul to be happy."

1037
01:12:42,377 --> 01:12:50,377
"You are my new beginning."

1038
01:12:52,254 --> 01:12:56,431
"And life is nothing
without you."

1039
01:12:57,760 --> 01:12:59,899
Look at what we got.

1040
01:13:00,529 --> 01:13:05,604
Traffic cops accepting
bribes on Kennedy bridge.

1041
01:13:07,136 --> 01:13:09,844
They must make at least
Rs. 3,000 a day.

1042
01:13:10,172 --> 01:13:11,172
Perfect.

1043
01:13:11,174 --> 01:13:12,175
Nikhil.

1044
01:13:13,510 --> 01:13:15,682
You'll be with us on this job.

1045
01:13:17,414 --> 01:13:18,449
Yes, of course.

1046
01:13:33,596 --> 01:13:34,290
Hello?

1047
01:13:34,315 --> 01:13:36,396
- Have you got anything
on the gang, Nikhil?

1048
01:13:37,567 --> 01:13:38,375
No.

1049
01:13:38,468 --> 01:13:40,812
- I don't think you're
up to doing this job.

1050
01:13:41,337 --> 01:13:43,112
- Come to my office tomorrow morning.

1051
01:13:43,407 --> 01:13:45,249
- The Commissioner has called a meeting.

1052
01:13:52,116 --> 01:13:53,116
- Nikhil?

1053
01:13:53,182 --> 01:13:54,957
Dinner is ready.
Shall I serve?

1054
01:13:55,285 --> 01:13:56,286
Not now, mom.

1055
01:13:57,954 --> 01:13:59,093
What's wrong?

1056
01:13:59,356 --> 01:14:00,800
You look upset.

1057
01:14:02,159 --> 01:14:05,732
Mom, if one of dad's
friends broke the law...

1058
01:14:07,198 --> 01:14:09,268
Would he have turned him in?

1059
01:14:09,432 --> 01:14:12,140
He would first try to explain.

1060
01:14:13,938 --> 01:14:17,078
And if he still didn't agree?

1061
01:14:19,076 --> 01:14:21,022
Then he would do his duty.

1062
01:14:21,979 --> 01:14:25,791
He would honour the oath he took
when he joined the police force...

1063
01:14:25,916 --> 01:14:28,760
more than the friendship.

1064
01:14:40,065 --> 01:14:41,270
Come on!

1065
01:14:46,904 --> 01:14:48,942
Come on, come on, get up, get up...

1066
01:14:49,107 --> 01:14:50,210
Are you okay?

1067
01:14:51,308 --> 01:14:52,014
Shit!

1068
01:14:52,177 --> 01:14:53,655
Carefully...

1069
01:14:56,313 --> 01:14:58,521
It looks like a muscle pull.

1070
01:14:59,583 --> 01:15:00,583
Nothing much.

1071
01:15:00,584 --> 01:15:01,757
You'll be fine.

1072
01:15:02,187 --> 01:15:04,064
You can't come with us today.

1073
01:15:05,123 --> 01:15:06,362
No, I'm coming.

1074
01:15:06,557 --> 01:15:09,664
This is my first job with the gang...
I don't want to miss it.

1075
01:15:09,828 --> 01:15:12,809
If you come on you first
job in this state and get caught...

1076
01:15:12,997 --> 01:15:14,806
it'll be your last one.

1077
01:15:15,365 --> 01:15:16,365
No.

1078
01:15:16,801 --> 01:15:17,836
No, I'm coming.

1079
01:15:18,202 --> 01:15:19,375
Relax, man.

1080
01:15:19,637 --> 01:15:21,343
It's not like this is our last job.

1081
01:15:24,009 --> 01:15:25,215
There's going to be traffic.

1082
01:15:25,610 --> 01:15:27,146
We should go or we'll be late.

1083
01:15:28,179 --> 01:15:28,953
Let's go.

1084
01:15:29,013 --> 01:15:30,048
Take care.

1085
01:15:30,482 --> 01:15:31,482
You'll be okay, man.

1086
01:15:32,684 --> 01:15:33,684
Come on, Maya.

1087
01:15:53,171 --> 01:15:54,343
Yes, Nikhil.

1088
01:15:54,507 --> 01:15:57,009
Sir, in half an hour
you'll find the Ungli Gang...

1089
01:15:57,075 --> 01:15:59,595
carrying out their latest
lark in the Mukesh Mills' basement.

1090
01:15:59,878 --> 01:16:01,222
How do you know?

1091
01:16:02,013 --> 01:16:03,356
I'll tell you later, sir.

1092
01:16:03,783 --> 01:16:05,887
You only have half an hour.

1093
01:16:14,659 --> 01:16:17,163
Stop on the side.

1094
01:16:18,196 --> 01:16:19,904
Stop on the side.

1095
01:16:23,569 --> 01:16:26,482
He's driving with
a broken number plate.

1096
01:16:27,205 --> 01:16:28,776
Come here, son.

1097
01:16:29,208 --> 01:16:30,208
Come.

1098
01:16:30,209 --> 01:16:31,209
- What happened, sir?

1099
01:16:31,210 --> 01:16:32,587
What do you mean what happened?

1100
01:16:32,645 --> 01:16:34,886
Think you can drive
with a broken number plate?

1101
01:16:35,014 --> 01:16:36,494
Show me your license.

1102
01:16:36,649 --> 01:16:38,060
I made a mistake, sir.
Let me go.

1103
01:16:38,150 --> 01:16:41,757
Okay, you made a mistake.
Now show me your papers.

1104
01:16:42,054 --> 01:16:43,294
Quickly.

1105
01:16:44,423 --> 01:16:45,903
Let's compromise, sir...

1106
01:16:46,592 --> 01:16:47,332
50 bucks?

1107
01:16:47,426 --> 01:16:49,100
Do I look like a beggar?

1108
01:16:49,729 --> 01:16:51,505
You won't get squat for 50 bucks.

1109
01:16:52,065 --> 01:16:53,236
Rs. 200. Come on.

1110
01:16:53,299 --> 01:16:54,574
200?!

1111
01:16:54,835 --> 01:16:56,142
200 is a lot, sir.

1112
01:16:56,368 --> 01:16:58,178
It's a lot, huh? Jeetu!

1113
01:16:58,704 --> 01:16:59,978
Write him a ticket.

1114
01:17:00,206 --> 01:17:02,811
A car that size and
200 is a lot for you?

1115
01:17:02,875 --> 01:17:04,048
Think I'm a fool?

1116
01:17:04,910 --> 01:17:06,049
Okay, fine.

1117
01:17:06,747 --> 01:17:08,248
My friends are in the car.

1118
01:17:08,747 --> 01:17:10,694
I'll try and get it from them.

1119
01:17:11,250 --> 01:17:11,921
Okay, come on!

1120
01:17:12,085 --> 01:17:13,621
Okay, you'll come.

1121
01:17:13,787 --> 01:17:14,696
You, come!

1122
01:17:14,753 --> 01:17:16,097
We have to go there.

1123
01:17:19,159 --> 01:17:20,831
Hey, what are you doing?!

1124
01:17:46,853 --> 01:17:48,731
You'll won't be spared!

1125
01:17:48,855 --> 01:17:49,856
Shut up.

1126
01:17:50,323 --> 01:17:52,803
You cops love the
taste of money, right?

1127
01:17:53,159 --> 01:17:54,159
Here.

1128
01:17:54,629 --> 01:17:56,301
Fill your stomach with this.

1129
01:17:56,931 --> 01:18:00,902
How can we eat these notes?

1130
01:18:00,968 --> 01:18:02,002
Why?

1131
01:18:02,369 --> 01:18:03,781
Isn't this pan of your diet?

1132
01:18:04,838 --> 01:18:05,838
Eat.

1133
01:18:07,642 --> 01:18:08,642
Eat.

1134
01:18:10,511 --> 01:18:11,580
Eat!

1135
01:18:40,775 --> 01:18:42,119
Surround the place.

1136
01:18:42,211 --> 01:18:43,331
Cover the entrance and exit.

1137
01:18:43,344 --> 01:18:45,154
The rest of you, come with me.

1138
01:18:50,586 --> 01:18:54,124
Look... please...
we can't digest these notes.

1139
01:18:54,623 --> 01:18:56,728
Try it with pickle.

1140
01:18:58,593 --> 01:18:59,971
Nice and tangy!

1141
01:19:01,562 --> 01:19:04,236
I can't believe you
brought pickle with you!

1142
01:19:04,532 --> 01:19:06,809
- Dude I've even got ketchup in the van.

1143
01:19:14,943 --> 01:19:15,943
Someone's coming.

1144
01:19:16,178 --> 01:19:17,178
The window!

1145
01:19:23,585 --> 01:19:25,087
Look upstairs!

1146
01:19:36,164 --> 01:19:37,164
Look! There he is!

1147
01:19:49,711 --> 01:19:50,747
Catch them.

1148
01:20:02,625 --> 01:20:04,262
Catch them, catch them!

1149
01:20:10,632 --> 01:20:11,976
Behind you!

1150
01:20:50,274 --> 01:20:51,718
Goti, run!

1151
01:21:07,056 --> 01:21:08,056
Nikhil!

1152
01:21:18,635 --> 01:21:19,978
Come on...

1153
01:21:20,938 --> 01:21:22,679
Come on!

1154
01:21:24,041 --> 01:21:25,884
He's not even answering his phone!

1155
01:21:26,443 --> 01:21:28,480
You think he's been
caught by the police?

1156
01:21:28,545 --> 01:21:30,024
Don't say that...

1157
01:21:31,048 --> 01:21:33,824
Goti.
- Shit, he's bleeding!

1158
01:21:35,519 --> 01:21:36,930
Oh, shit man!

1159
01:21:39,089 --> 01:21:40,899
Should we take him to a hospital?

1160
01:21:41,458 --> 01:21:43,062
The bullet's just grazed his arm.

1161
01:21:43,795 --> 01:21:45,102
He's lucky.

1162
01:21:51,468 --> 01:21:52,607
You were with him...

1163
01:22:04,181 --> 01:22:05,718
How come your foot is fine?

1164
01:22:09,220 --> 01:22:11,757
ACP Kale called him by name.

1165
01:22:16,728 --> 01:22:18,207
How does he know your name?

1166
01:22:20,565 --> 01:22:21,839
Nikhil?

1167
01:22:26,638 --> 01:22:28,083
I lied to you'll.

1168
01:22:30,208 --> 01:22:31,881
I'm not a law student.

1169
01:22:33,845 --> 01:22:35,188
I'm a police officer.

1170
01:22:41,786 --> 01:22:44,392
Kale assigned me
to the Ungli gang case.

1171
01:22:45,490 --> 01:22:49,063
This dinbag has been
fooling us this whole time.

1172
01:22:50,762 --> 01:22:52,800
We trusted you.

1173
01:22:54,566 --> 01:22:56,773
We thought you were our friend.

1174
01:23:00,104 --> 01:23:02,642
This is your idea of friendship?!

1175
01:23:02,708 --> 01:23:03,447
Abhay!

1176
01:23:03,708 --> 01:23:04,847
Abhay!

1177
01:23:08,347 --> 01:23:09,984
What do we do with him now?

1178
01:23:10,216 --> 01:23:12,025
We can't let him go.

1179
01:23:14,620 --> 01:23:17,499
He'll report everything to the police.

1180
01:23:18,957 --> 01:23:20,904
We have only one option.

1181
01:23:21,093 --> 01:23:22,902
We have to finish him.

1182
01:23:23,262 --> 01:23:24,570
Are you insane?

1183
01:23:25,064 --> 01:23:27,704
You want to be a murderer?
- Maya's right, Goti.

1184
01:23:30,336 --> 01:23:31,940
We're not killers.

1185
01:23:34,341 --> 01:23:38,311
Do you guys understand that
his freedom means jail for us all?!

1186
01:23:38,611 --> 01:23:42,184
I'm not going to go to
jail for this scumbag betrayer!

1187
01:23:42,314 --> 01:23:42,986
Kalim!

1188
01:23:43,116 --> 01:23:44,526
I'm going to kill him,
I'm going to finish him!

1189
01:23:44,583 --> 01:23:45,391
Kalim!

1190
01:23:45,484 --> 01:23:47,930
Get out of my way,
I'm going to kill him!

1191
01:23:48,153 --> 01:23:50,258
Move out my way, Abhay!

1192
01:23:50,356 --> 01:23:51,596
Control yourself!

1193
01:23:51,757 --> 01:23:52,896
Stop it!

1194
01:23:53,625 --> 01:23:56,106
Stop it!
- Goti's been shot!

1195
01:23:56,196 --> 01:23:56,900
Stop!

1196
01:23:56,962 --> 01:23:58,533
I can't go to jail for him!

1197
01:23:58,598 --> 01:23:59,303
Stop!

1198
01:23:59,399 --> 01:24:02,073
I can't go to jail for him, man!

1199
01:24:03,402 --> 01:24:06,008
I can't go to jail for him...

1200
01:24:06,238 --> 01:24:07,650
Get out, Nikhil.

1201
01:24:08,208 --> 01:24:09,652
- Go man.

1202
01:24:10,243 --> 01:24:13,315
Before one of us actually kills you.

1203
01:24:15,215 --> 01:24:17,593
- I can't go to jail for him...

1204
01:24:18,285 --> 01:24:19,285
I'm sorry.

1205
01:24:26,793 --> 01:24:33,074
"Hollow eyes."

1206
01:24:37,104 --> 01:24:39,481
"Traces of a lost dream."

1207
01:24:39,573 --> 01:24:43,611
"Like a broken star."

1208
01:24:47,581 --> 01:24:52,588
"The flame of hope,
flickers and fades..."

1209
01:24:52,820 --> 01:24:58,395
"How, then, do we light the way?"

1210
01:24:59,492 --> 01:25:03,964
"Oh, Lord... show me the way."

1211
01:25:04,866 --> 01:25:09,815
"Oh, Lord... show me the way."

1212
01:25:10,705 --> 01:25:12,776
"Pick up this broken man."

1213
01:25:12,840 --> 01:25:14,683
- What happened, Nikhil?

1214
01:25:15,308 --> 01:25:19,348
"Oh, Lord... show me the way."

1215
01:25:20,515 --> 01:25:25,260
"Oh, Lord... show me the way."

1216
01:25:33,395 --> 01:25:37,934
"Oh, Lord... show me the way."

1217
01:25:38,766 --> 01:25:41,076
"Oh, Lord... show me the way."

1218
01:25:41,135 --> 01:25:42,240
Abhay?

1219
01:25:43,304 --> 01:25:44,442
What's wrong?

1220
01:25:47,141 --> 01:25:48,143
Teesta...

1221
01:25:50,244 --> 01:25:51,553
I have to tell you something.

1222
01:25:51,647 --> 01:25:55,958
Something I should
have told you earlier...

1223
01:25:56,851 --> 01:25:57,922
What?

1224
01:26:00,255 --> 01:26:05,294
"Two paths lie before me..."

1225
01:26:05,392 --> 01:26:11,036
"Which one must I take?"

1226
01:26:12,701 --> 01:26:14,907
- What's going on with Kale?

1227
01:26:15,170 --> 01:26:17,741
Why hasn't he caught the Ungli gang yet?

1228
01:26:17,905 --> 01:26:19,749
My phone is ringing off the hook.

1229
01:26:19,808 --> 01:26:21,048
I'll speak to him, sir.

1230
01:26:21,143 --> 01:26:22,143
Hurry UP-

1231
01:26:22,144 --> 01:26:24,522
In any case,
it's time for his transfer.

1232
01:26:25,347 --> 01:26:27,725
You know how things
get during this time.

1233
01:26:28,950 --> 01:26:34,024
"Oh, Lord... show me the way."

1234
01:26:41,763 --> 01:26:46,371
- It's my own fault for
thinking you're like your father.

1235
01:26:46,735 --> 01:26:48,272
But the truth is...

1236
01:26:48,337 --> 01:26:52,910
that you're not worthy of being
his son nor of wearing this uniform.

1237
01:26:53,075 --> 01:26:54,419
What uniform are you talking about?!

1238
01:26:54,477 --> 01:26:57,458
The one they wear to accept
bribes at every traffic signal?

1239
01:26:57,513 --> 01:27:00,392
The one they wear
to ask for money to...

1240
01:27:00,483 --> 01:27:03,157
ignore cases or extort
money from citizens by threatening...

1241
01:27:03,219 --> 01:27:05,220
them with false cases?

1242
01:27:05,687 --> 01:27:08,760
Half the police officers
are bursting out of their shins...

1243
01:27:08,858 --> 01:27:10,997
because they're stuffed with money.

1244
01:27:11,226 --> 01:27:14,936
Children's dirty nappies
are changed immediately.

1245
01:27:15,064 --> 01:27:17,738
But the system has
been dirty since 1947...

1246
01:27:17,967 --> 01:27:21,346
and the police's job of changing
it is being done by the Ungli gang!

1247
01:27:21,437 --> 01:27:22,973
What nonsense are you talking, Nikhil?

1248
01:27:23,239 --> 01:27:25,947
The ones you're
praising are criminals.

1249
01:27:26,409 --> 01:27:29,117
And the ones you want to
arrest are now my friends, sir.

1250
01:27:30,146 --> 01:27:31,682
I realized that if they get caught...

1251
01:27:31,781 --> 01:27:33,781
it's not them but
a hope that will be locked up.

1252
01:27:33,783 --> 01:27:35,695
A hope that every citizen
of this country has.

1253
01:27:35,786 --> 01:27:38,527
That there's finally someone
who's ready to fight the system.

1254
01:27:38,656 --> 01:27:39,656
Without any agenda.

1255
01:27:39,722 --> 01:27:41,896
I want all their names.
Immediately!

1256
01:27:41,992 --> 01:27:43,095
Sorry, sir.

1257
01:27:43,960 --> 01:27:46,031
I can't tell you their names.

1258
01:27:46,095 --> 01:27:48,440
Come to the police station.
I'll make you talk.

1259
01:27:48,532 --> 01:27:49,532
Come on!

1260
01:27:55,605 --> 01:27:56,448
Yes, sir!

1261
01:27:56,507 --> 01:27:59,750
- Kale, leave every1hing
and come meet me.

1262
01:27:59,943 --> 01:28:00,512
But, sir...

1263
01:28:00,577 --> 01:28:01,577
- Right now, Kale.

1264
01:28:24,368 --> 01:28:26,109
- Will you have a drink, Kale?

1265
01:28:26,471 --> 01:28:28,313
No, sir. I'm driving.

1266
01:28:31,175 --> 01:28:32,984
It's bad news...

1267
01:28:33,277 --> 01:28:34,415
I didn't understand.

1268
01:28:34,511 --> 01:28:36,184
That's why I've called you.

1269
01:28:36,580 --> 01:28:37,888
- To explain.

1270
01:28:39,449 --> 01:28:42,726
- Kale, the order for
your transfer has come.

1271
01:28:44,087 --> 01:28:46,033
Don't look at me like that.

1272
01:28:46,557 --> 01:28:49,060
- They were going to
transfer you to Zone 11.

1273
01:28:49,259 --> 01:28:52,866
You would rot and die there.

1274
01:28:53,096 --> 01:28:54,701
I staked my reputation on you...

1275
01:28:54,766 --> 01:28:57,645
so the commissioner
agreed to put you somewhere good.

1276
01:28:58,569 --> 01:29:02,677
Sir, if you transfer me,
what will happen to the Ungli gang?

1277
01:29:02,774 --> 01:29:04,343
Don't worry about them.

1278
01:29:04,475 --> 01:29:06,080
Worry about yourself.

1279
01:29:07,745 --> 01:29:12,126
You know you can't get a good
post without bribery these days.

1280
01:29:12,183 --> 01:29:13,526
Isn't that right?

1281
01:29:15,553 --> 01:29:18,261
There's a lot of competition
for the dockyard area.

1282
01:29:18,423 --> 01:29:20,061
Lots of officers want it.

1283
01:29:20,191 --> 01:29:22,330
I'm giving you that.

1284
01:29:22,393 --> 01:29:26,137
Just make sure you give
Rs. 5 lakhs to B. R. Dayal.

1285
01:29:26,397 --> 01:29:27,967
I'll handle the rest.

1286
01:29:28,066 --> 01:29:29,545
B. R. Dayal?

1287
01:29:29,767 --> 01:29:31,110
That fixer?!

1288
01:29:32,204 --> 01:29:35,844
He manages all the illegal
money of the police force.

1289
01:29:36,407 --> 01:29:39,354
In the next few years, you'll
have to pay about 40-50 lakhs more...

1290
01:29:39,444 --> 01:29:40,924
But don't worry.

1291
01:29:41,080 --> 01:29:43,993
You'll be earning so much,
this will seem like nothing.

1292
01:29:44,183 --> 01:29:47,164
Sir, I'm not interested in that...

1293
01:29:47,219 --> 01:29:48,697
only in law enforcement.

1294
01:29:48,786 --> 01:29:50,289
I know, Kale.

1295
01:29:50,356 --> 01:29:55,999
But if you don't accept,
that's the end of your career.

1296
01:29:59,365 --> 01:30:00,435
Go home.

1297
01:30:00,633 --> 01:30:02,909
And think peacefully about it.

1298
01:30:03,669 --> 01:30:05,478
You have three days.

1299
01:30:06,105 --> 01:30:08,449
And then, even I can't help you.

1300
01:30:10,142 --> 01:30:11,416
- Think about it.

1301
01:30:21,420 --> 01:30:22,899
You were right, Nikhil.

1302
01:30:23,556 --> 01:30:26,196
The men in uniform
are the worst criminals.

1303
01:30:26,659 --> 01:30:29,333
I have no right to arrest you.

1304
01:30:32,032 --> 01:30:34,638
It's all dirty... from head to toe.

1305
01:30:48,681 --> 01:30:51,924
Come on.
Stan the bike.

1306
01:30:55,855 --> 01:30:57,357
- I don't get it, man.

1307
01:30:58,591 --> 01:31:00,502
- We were going to stay
away from this place.

1308
01:31:00,726 --> 01:31:02,229
Somethings wrong.

1309
01:31:02,829 --> 01:31:04,934
Why did Abhay call us here?

1310
01:31:08,702 --> 01:31:09,840
Abhay!

1311
01:31:11,204 --> 01:31:13,081
You-

1312
01:31:19,446 --> 01:31:21,517
If I wanted to arrest you'll...

1313
01:31:21,681 --> 01:31:24,252
we would be talking
in the police station.

1314
01:31:24,351 --> 01:31:27,264
Where Kale would beat
a confession out of you'll.

1315
01:31:29,122 --> 01:31:32,160
You must be wondering
why that hasn't happened yet.

1316
01:31:35,662 --> 01:31:37,164
Consider it a kindness from me.

1317
01:31:38,199 --> 01:31:40,236
I haven't told Kale your names.

1318
01:31:42,068 --> 01:31:43,068
Why?

1319
01:31:44,305 --> 01:31:46,546
I thought your goal
was to have us caught.

1320
01:31:46,707 --> 01:31:47,707
It was.

1321
01:31:48,341 --> 01:31:49,341
It was.

1322
01:31:50,311 --> 01:31:52,313
But then I got to know all of you.

1323
01:31:52,747 --> 01:31:55,090
I began to understand the
objective of the Ungli Gang.

1324
01:31:55,282 --> 01:31:59,992
Began to understand how the
injustice dealt to Ricky led...

1325
01:32:00,954 --> 01:32:02,992
you'll to seek justice.

1326
01:32:03,523 --> 01:32:05,483
Really...
- I started believing in my new friends.

1327
01:32:05,593 --> 01:32:08,130
If you believed in us so much...

1328
01:32:09,996 --> 01:32:12,773
why did you inform Kale about us?

1329
01:32:15,403 --> 01:32:17,849
My father was a
sincere police officer.

1330
01:32:18,472 --> 01:32:20,748
He gave his life for his duty.

1331
01:32:21,977 --> 01:32:24,320
I put myself in his shoes...

1332
01:32:24,478 --> 01:32:28,256
And as noble as your
intentions were...

1333
01:32:29,483 --> 01:32:32,487
He wouldn't have let you
take the law in your own hands.

1334
01:32:34,055 --> 01:32:37,832
I realized that I am not my father.

1335
01:32:39,693 --> 01:32:41,536
And he may not have been right.

1336
01:32:42,864 --> 01:32:45,366
Why have you come here today?

1337
01:32:46,635 --> 01:32:47,942
I need you'll.

1338
01:32:50,871 --> 01:32:52,874
Because somebody needs you'll.

1339
01:32:54,375 --> 01:32:57,584
They don't need law,
government or the police...

1340
01:32:57,946 --> 01:32:59,789
only the Ungli gang.

1341
01:33:00,147 --> 01:33:01,354
This is bullshit.

1342
01:33:01,550 --> 01:33:03,996
He's trying to trick us again.
- Wait a minute.

1343
01:33:05,921 --> 01:33:07,958
Say we agree to help you.

1344
01:33:09,423 --> 01:33:11,028
What will we get in return?

1345
01:33:12,761 --> 01:33:15,002
That which made you'll
form the Ungli gang.

1346
01:33:16,765 --> 01:33:18,108
Justice for Ricky.

1347
01:33:19,901 --> 01:33:23,041
Anshuman Dayal and
his father BR Dayal.

1348
01:33:33,716 --> 01:33:35,126
Why have you come here?

1349
01:33:35,650 --> 01:33:37,028
To take you away from here.

1350
01:33:37,286 --> 01:33:38,491
Don't make me hit you.

1351
01:33:38,687 --> 01:33:40,099
I want to explain something to you.

1352
01:33:40,189 --> 01:33:42,726
Nothing gets solved from
sitting and drinking at a bar.

1353
01:33:42,959 --> 01:33:45,199
If you want to do something about it,
I can show you how.

1354
01:33:45,393 --> 01:33:47,304
Remember when I was
the one giving you orders?

1355
01:33:47,395 --> 01:33:48,396
What can I say?

1356
01:33:48,865 --> 01:33:51,367
I can't see a lion cower like this.

1357
01:33:52,068 --> 01:33:55,277
Nikhil, there are less
than 300 lions in India.

1358
01:33:55,638 --> 01:33:58,050
If another one dies...
it makes no difference.

1359
01:33:59,275 --> 01:34:00,583
What do you need?

1360
01:34:01,944 --> 01:34:03,753
Just because you're not
giving Dayal Rs. 5 lakhs...

1361
01:34:03,813 --> 01:34:06,122
doesn't mean you
spend it all on whiskey.

1362
01:34:06,381 --> 01:34:09,420
Sitting here and crying
will achieve nothing.

1363
01:34:10,119 --> 01:34:12,156
Tears only dilute the whiskey.

1364
01:34:13,489 --> 01:34:15,196
It's not that easy.

1365
01:34:15,925 --> 01:34:17,370
You were right, Nikhil.

1366
01:34:18,027 --> 01:34:21,804
Every police officer's uniform
is tainted with corruption.

1367
01:34:22,532 --> 01:34:27,380
Even DCP Sivaraman, whom I respected.

1368
01:34:28,271 --> 01:34:30,046
It's won't just wash off.

1369
01:34:30,206 --> 01:34:32,243
Who wants to wash it off?

1370
01:34:32,742 --> 01:34:34,619
I want to strip them naked...

1371
01:34:35,078 --> 01:34:36,581
Forget washing.

1372
01:34:37,214 --> 01:34:38,749
And who's going to strip them naked?

1373
01:34:40,616 --> 01:34:42,426
You, me and some of my friends.

1374
01:34:43,620 --> 01:34:45,793
Why would the Ungli gang work with me?

1375
01:34:47,023 --> 01:34:48,765
Because like yours...

1376
01:34:49,893 --> 01:34:51,634
this is where their heart lies.

1377
01:35:00,871 --> 01:35:02,248
ACP Kale...

1378
01:35:03,774 --> 01:35:05,082
meet the Ungli Gang.

1379
01:35:05,242 --> 01:35:08,052
Guys, ACP Kale.

1380
01:35:18,156 --> 01:35:20,328
I don't shake hands with criminals.

1381
01:35:22,493 --> 01:35:24,201
We aren't criminals.

1382
01:35:25,195 --> 01:35:26,697
And from what Nikhil says...

1383
01:35:26,797 --> 01:35:29,243
you need us and we need you.

1384
01:35:29,700 --> 01:35:31,611
That's why we're here.

1385
01:35:35,372 --> 01:35:36,579
What's the plan?

1386
01:35:49,320 --> 01:35:51,129
- Sir, Kale sir is here.

1387
01:35:53,825 --> 01:35:54,825
Bring him in.

1388
01:35:58,930 --> 01:36:00,341
Come, Kale, come.

1389
01:36:00,932 --> 01:36:01,932
- Sit.

1390
01:36:05,103 --> 01:36:07,242
I just suffered a loss of Rs. 10.

1391
01:36:08,906 --> 01:36:12,285
I bet that you wouldn't come.

1392
01:36:13,111 --> 01:36:14,317
This is Rs. 3 lakh.

1393
01:36:14,979 --> 01:36:16,083
Count it.

1394
01:36:17,582 --> 01:36:19,459
Don't embarrass me.

1395
01:36:21,252 --> 01:36:25,496
The world knows there
is no cop as honest as Kale.

1396
01:36:27,026 --> 01:36:31,201
Even when you're being underhanded,
you'll be honest.

1397
01:36:33,332 --> 01:36:37,336
Anyway, what about
the rest of the money?

1398
01:36:38,737 --> 01:36:40,716
Today's the last date.

1399
01:36:41,774 --> 01:36:44,447
Tomorrow seems auspicious
to put the money away.

1400
01:36:45,477 --> 01:36:49,322
It's not easy for me to put
together this much money so quickly.

1401
01:36:50,314 --> 01:36:52,453
I'll send it tonight with my men.

1402
01:36:52,950 --> 01:36:56,797
Then tomorrow morning your post
at the dockyard will be confirmed.

1403
01:36:57,556 --> 01:36:59,627
Earn lots of money.

1404
01:36:59,892 --> 01:37:01,838
Throw a net to catch some cash.

1405
01:37:05,396 --> 01:37:07,536
I know you're new to this.

1406
01:37:08,366 --> 01:37:09,710
But don't worry.

1407
01:37:10,769 --> 01:37:12,373
It's only tough to start with.

1408
01:37:12,438 --> 01:37:14,782
Slowly, you'll get used to it.

1409
01:37:16,375 --> 01:37:18,082
Just think of it like this...

1410
01:37:19,244 --> 01:37:24,421
You're not buying a house;
You're buying a career.

1411
01:37:26,920 --> 01:37:28,523
My son, Anshuman.

1412
01:37:28,887 --> 01:37:30,491
Do namaste to Kale sir.

1413
01:37:30,589 --> 01:37:31,465
Namaste.

1414
01:37:31,523 --> 01:37:32,366
Come, sit.

1415
01:37:32,459 --> 01:37:33,267
No, Dad.

1416
01:37:33,325 --> 01:37:34,429
I gotta go.
I'll see you later.

1417
01:37:34,493 --> 01:37:35,734
<i>O</i> kaY-

1418
01:37:36,895 --> 01:37:39,739
Drive carefully.

1419
01:37:39,832 --> 01:37:40,832
- Yes...

1420
01:37:41,535 --> 01:37:42,570
Namaste.

1421
01:37:44,638 --> 01:37:46,776
Take care of this.

1422
01:37:46,905 --> 01:37:49,385
This is between you
and the police force.

1423
01:37:49,708 --> 01:37:52,154
Who am I to come between
such a beautiful relationship?

1424
01:37:53,580 --> 01:37:54,251
Pande!

1425
01:37:54,314 --> 01:37:55,314
Yes, sir.

1426
01:37:56,249 --> 01:37:58,888
Take Kale sir and
have him keep the money inside.

1427
01:37:58,951 --> 01:38:00,932
Go, Kale.

1428
01:38:09,796 --> 01:38:10,797
Come, sir.

1429
01:38:29,949 --> 01:38:31,952
- Thank God he's gone...

1430
01:38:37,490 --> 01:38:38,834
Boys.

1431
01:38:46,533 --> 01:38:48,172
What do you want?

1432
01:38:48,236 --> 01:38:49,714
Kale sir has sent us.

1433
01:38:50,004 --> 01:38:51,574
Let the car in!

1434
01:39:08,189 --> 01:39:09,031
Yes, sir?

1435
01:39:09,123 --> 01:39:10,158
Kale sir's money.

1436
01:39:10,257 --> 01:39:11,257
One minute.

1437
01:39:23,238 --> 01:39:25,046
Hello?
- Sir, Kale sir's men are here.

1438
01:39:25,105 --> 01:39:27,016
Should I throw a welcome party?!

1439
01:39:27,775 --> 01:39:30,756
Take them to the room
and have the money kept.

1440
01:39:30,845 --> 01:39:32,018
Yes, sir.

1441
01:39:33,047 --> 01:39:34,219
Come.

1442
01:40:19,495 --> 01:40:20,768
Hello, sir.

1443
01:40:22,932 --> 01:40:23,932
Who's come?

1444
01:40:23,998 --> 01:40:25,569
Kale's men, sir.

1445
01:40:54,663 --> 01:40:56,644
I've seen you before.

1446
01:40:59,335 --> 01:41:01,474
Have you ever come here before?

1447
01:41:02,338 --> 01:41:03,907
No. First time.

1448
01:41:10,046 --> 01:41:11,081
<i>O</i> kaY-

1449
01:41:44,448 --> 01:41:45,619
Teesta Sen?

1450
01:41:45,848 --> 01:41:47,055
ACP Kale.

1451
01:41:47,484 --> 01:41:49,794
Of course, I know you.
But you're here...?

1452
01:41:50,087 --> 01:41:52,966
Are you ready for the
biggest story of your life?

1453
01:41:56,460 --> 01:41:57,563
Welcome, everyone.

1454
01:41:57,626 --> 01:42:00,470
In today's breaking news, a story...

1455
01:42:00,529 --> 01:42:04,979
that will blow the doors wide
open on corruption in this country.

1456
01:42:05,435 --> 01:42:07,745
The criminal is neither
a minister nor a politician...

1457
01:42:07,871 --> 01:42:11,785
The criminals are the same
ones who are meant to stop crime.

1458
01:42:11,875 --> 01:42:13,013
Our Police.

1459
01:42:13,110 --> 01:42:16,182
And the one making this sensational...

1460
01:42:16,246 --> 01:42:20,854
and shocking accusation
is ACP Ashok Kale.

1461
01:42:21,184 --> 01:42:25,860
Sir, can you tell our viewers
what happened that night?

1462
01:42:28,426 --> 01:42:31,998
For the first time in my career,
I was told...

1463
01:42:32,362 --> 01:42:36,641
that if I paid, I would
be transferred to a good place.

1464
01:42:37,001 --> 01:42:39,139
Otherwise,
I would be transferred to place...

1465
01:42:39,236 --> 01:42:41,114
which could be career-ending.

1466
01:42:41,305 --> 01:42:45,755
How much money were you asked to pay?

1467
01:42:46,844 --> 01:42:48,585
Rs. 5 lakh, upfront.

1468
01:42:48,846 --> 01:42:52,794
Above that, 40-50 lakhs to
be paid off in the coming years.

1469
01:42:53,018 --> 01:42:54,827
Who made this offer?

1470
01:42:57,689 --> 01:42:59,532
- My superior officer.

1471
01:42:59,857 --> 01:43:01,666
- DCP Sivaraman.

1472
01:43:03,027 --> 01:43:05,940
- Who collects this
money for the police?

1473
01:43:06,030 --> 01:43:10,103
- BR Dayal who is the
fixer for the police force.

1474
01:43:11,102 --> 01:43:12,548
Bloody swine.

1475
01:43:12,904 --> 01:43:17,080
- This money is distributed
through the police force.

1476
01:43:17,175 --> 01:43:18,519
How high does this go?

1477
01:43:19,644 --> 01:43:21,784
To the Commissioner of police.

1478
01:43:22,680 --> 01:43:26,457
You're making some
serious allegations.

1479
01:43:27,051 --> 01:43:30,225
- Do you have any proof?

1480
01:43:30,322 --> 01:43:31,800
- I do have proof.

1481
01:43:32,223 --> 01:43:33,726
And that evidence...

1482
01:43:34,159 --> 01:43:38,106
will bring the police force
crashing down like a house of cards.

1483
01:43:40,833 --> 01:43:46,306
The police force's money is kept
under high security in Dayal's house.

1484
01:43:51,410 --> 01:43:54,948
This money is counted
by everyone who gets it.

1485
01:44:01,453 --> 01:44:04,059
This money has been sprayed
with a sulfur solution...

1486
01:44:05,724 --> 01:44:09,171
When this solution comes
in contact with saliva...

1487
01:44:09,494 --> 01:44:12,839
It leaves a black mark on
the tongue of the person counting.

1488
01:44:36,889 --> 01:44:39,233
How long does this mark remain?

1489
01:44:39,292 --> 01:44:40,702
Four days.

1490
01:44:40,859 --> 01:44:43,204
It's next to impossible
to get rid of it.

1491
01:44:43,929 --> 01:44:46,706
It can only be removed with acid.

1492
01:44:46,766 --> 01:44:48,404
And I'm sure...

1493
01:44:48,468 --> 01:44:52,439
my capable fellow officers
won't wash their tongues with acid.

1494
01:45:08,789 --> 01:45:12,998
So all we have to do is
ask our top police officers...

1495
01:45:13,326 --> 01:45:17,274
"Sir, would you mind
showing us your tongue?"

1496
01:45:27,941 --> 01:45:30,354
Sir, can you show us your tongue?

1497
01:45:33,114 --> 01:45:35,754
Can we see your tongue?

1498
01:45:38,351 --> 01:45:40,456
How much money did you
take to blacken your tongue?

1499
01:45:49,429 --> 01:45:51,170
Open the door, Sivaraman!

1500
01:45:52,865 --> 01:45:54,277
- Sir, we won't leave!

1501
01:45:54,368 --> 01:45:56,541
- Open the door!

1502
01:46:04,712 --> 01:46:06,589
Down with the Commissioner!

1503
01:46:06,747 --> 01:46:10,251
The Chief Minister should resign.

1504
01:46:10,417 --> 01:46:14,024
If the owner is dishonest,
then why won't the dog steal the bone?

1505
01:46:14,121 --> 01:46:15,896
Down with corruption!

1506
01:46:15,989 --> 01:46:17,833
Down with the Mumbai Police!

1507
01:46:17,893 --> 01:46:19,565
The public is furious, Chief Minister.

1508
01:46:20,462 --> 01:46:21,838
This agitation will increase more.

1509
01:46:22,429 --> 01:46:23,431
We need to solve this.

1510
01:46:38,280 --> 01:46:39,280
Ma'am...

1511
01:46:39,547 --> 01:46:41,322
- Could I get an autograph?
- Settle down...

1512
01:46:41,950 --> 01:46:43,485
Settle down...

1513
01:46:44,252 --> 01:46:48,029
To erase the corruption
that's destroying our society...

1514
01:46:48,623 --> 01:46:52,537
I have decided
to take some severe steps.

1515
01:46:53,228 --> 01:46:57,040
So that the people meant
to protect the people aren't...

1516
01:46:57,098 --> 01:46:59,271
the ones taking advantage of them.

1517
01:47:00,869 --> 01:47:06,979
Today onwards, ACP Kale will
be relieved from his position.

1518
01:47:09,644 --> 01:47:12,284
From today, he is no longer ACP...

1519
01:47:12,681 --> 01:47:16,322
But Mumbai's new
Commissioner of Police.

1520
01:47:18,420 --> 01:47:20,526
Kale, you rock!

1521
01:47:21,156 --> 01:47:27,107
- So that, we can fight
corruption from the top.

1522
01:47:27,496 --> 01:47:33,742
- I would now like Commissioner Kale
to discuss his plans for the city.

1523
01:47:38,207 --> 01:47:40,550
All I want to say is...

1524
01:47:40,809 --> 01:47:42,811
No one is bigger than the law.

1525
01:47:43,111 --> 01:47:45,615
Even if he is the
protecter of the law.

1526
01:47:45,781 --> 01:47:51,788
Commissioner Kale, how did you carry
out the sting operation on your own?

1527
01:47:52,021 --> 01:47:53,694
The planning and all?

1528
01:47:55,057 --> 01:47:56,559
I wasn't alone.

1529
01:47:57,026 --> 01:47:58,698
My friends helped me.

1530
01:48:21,150 --> 01:48:22,288
- Commissioner Kale...

1531
01:48:22,919 --> 01:48:24,329
Not bad!

1532
01:48:25,054 --> 01:48:27,557
But, why have you called us here?

1533
01:48:27,723 --> 01:48:29,704
To give you all some good news.

1534
01:48:29,860 --> 01:48:33,329
Dayal and his son have been
given a tough and lengthy prison term.

1535
01:48:36,166 --> 01:48:37,873
Justice for Ricky...

1536
01:48:37,934 --> 01:48:39,913
I would like to meet him some time...

1537
01:48:40,069 --> 01:48:44,644
And pay my respects to the man
that the Ungli gang was formed for.

1538
01:48:44,842 --> 01:48:46,320
Of course, sir.

1539
01:48:47,077 --> 01:48:51,753
He would love to meet
the man who helped his friends.

1540
01:48:53,383 --> 01:48:56,125
You don't shake hands
with criminals, so...

1541
01:48:56,953 --> 01:48:58,125
No, I don't.

1542
01:49:03,227 --> 01:49:04,227
Sir..

1543
01:49:05,162 --> 01:49:06,162
Sorry.

1544
01:49:09,366 --> 01:49:11,039
So should I confirm this alliance?

1545
01:49:11,234 --> 01:49:14,511
The uniform looks good on you...
would you like to wear it again?

1546
01:49:16,941 --> 01:49:18,248
I'll think about it.

1547
01:49:18,408 --> 01:49:19,615
Think.

1548
01:49:19,710 --> 01:49:21,746
I'll be waiting for
you at the club tomorrow.

1549
01:49:21,811 --> 01:49:23,314
Let's have a drink.

1550
01:49:23,380 --> 01:49:25,121
You're planning to trap me again?

1551
01:49:25,181 --> 01:49:26,592
Maybe...

1552
01:49:26,816 --> 01:49:31,196
I hope that this city will
no longer need the Ungli gang...

1553
01:49:31,356 --> 01:49:33,130
That depends on you, sir.

1554
01:49:33,190 --> 01:49:36,797
If you do your work...
we won't be needed.

1555
01:49:37,362 --> 01:49:39,534
That's the thing
about this generation.

1556
01:49:39,662 --> 01:49:42,233
Give them an inch,
and they want a mile.
