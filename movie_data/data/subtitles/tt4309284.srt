<font color="#ffff80"><b>Fixed & Synced by bozxphd.Enjoy The Flick</b></font>

2
00:01:03,666 --> 00:01:04,916
My name is Kapil.

3
00:01:05,583 --> 00:01:06,916
I am a search & Rescue Trainer

4
00:01:07,208 --> 00:01:08,958
and mountaineering Instructor.

5
00:01:09,375 --> 00:01:14,708
I train people to fight adversities

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,625
and win over them saving
others and themselves.

7
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:24,416
Look at the coincidence,

8
00:01:31,666 --> 00:01:32,083
Jaideep.

9
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:09,458
These roads are the same, Same is the view.

10
00:02:09,458 --> 00:02:14,708
But that time is lost somewhere.

11
00:02:14,708 --> 00:02:19,958
Silence has just passed by the ears.

12
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:25,166
Perhaps something was said mildly.

13
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:30,416
These roads are the same, Same is the view.

14
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:35,666
But that time is lost somewhere.

15
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:40,916
Silence has just passed by the ears.

16
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:45,375
Perhaps something was said mildly

17
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:52,875
it is the well known aroma.

18
00:02:54,500 --> 00:03:00,458
That I feel in the dreams.

19
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:06,583
Where is that dream destination.

20
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:11,708
That is often visited by the clouds

21
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:18,541
it is the well known aroma.

22
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:24,333
That I feel in the dreams.

23
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:57,250
This is Gauri, Kshitijs fiance

24
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:04,875
both used to teach in the
school for special kids.

25
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:13,166
Dipankar, Kshitijs friend.

26
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:44,208
Children would also join us one day, Sure.

27
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:48,750
Looking at them as mountaineers
will change people's perception

28
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:51,625
and they will get respect instead of pity.

29
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:54,083
Kshitij...

30
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:03,625
probably a mountaineer like him...

31
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:07,458
But destiny had other plans...

32
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:42,541
Kshitij...

33
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:44,708
Kshitij...

34
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:49,208
Kshitij...

35
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:58,500
Both of them come here every year...

36
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:01,041
To remember lost friends...

37
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:06,541
and to remember kshitijs dream...
dream that is still unfulfilled.

38
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:52,916
In search & rescue training camp,
today we will talk about disasters.

39
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:56,250
Do you know why so many people get
killed in disasters and accidents?

40
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:57,958
Have we ever thought about it.

41
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:04,875
Because we lack life saving skills.

42
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:10,958
Rather than first-aid during accidents,
we handle victims like dead wood,

43
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:15,833
We cannot deliver CPR, instead start to
manhandle the doctor in case of deaths.

44
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:37,875
Bisht...

45
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:39,250
Bisht...

46
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:40,916
just check

47
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:46,708
and then we have neither a
plan nor knowledge for rescue.

48
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:50,000
How can then we expect.

49
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:53,875
To be saved in an emergency?

50
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,708
Hello, may I help you.

51
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:56,875
Hello.

52
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:00,708
Is it some mountaineering course?

53
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,458
National Social Service camp.

54
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:04,083
NSS...

55
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:06,458
National Social Service camp.

56
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:09,666
We impart disaster
management related training.

57
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:14,250
What to do? What not to do?

58
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:16,125
Wow, sounds good

59
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:21,500
I saw those ropes so thought
its a mountaineering course

60
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:23,583
search and rescue is part of this training

61
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:25,208
and you

62
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:26,833
yes...

63
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:28,166
I myself...

64
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:29,916
Gauri.

65
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:36,791
Sir.

66
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:39,541
Some school people.

67
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:40,791
OK

68
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:44,416
Were interested in organizing
a mountaineering course.

69
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:55,208
Seen her somewhere.

70
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,166
Coincidentally I was the one
leading this operation to.

71
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:13,583
We found only one of them
alive and that was Dipankar.

72
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:16,083
Mr. Pandey,

73
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:17,791
We are trying our best.

74
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:18,625
Sir,

75
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:21,375
he is deaf... he cant hear...

76
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:25,208
just after few hours.

77
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:27,875
How can you say...

78
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:30,208
that he cannot be traced.

79
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,958
Dipankar shared that Kshitij
had left to bring help...

80
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:41,666
but we could not trace him even
after searching for a week...

81
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:43,625
and then one day...

82
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:53,333
yes sir,

83
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:56,541
Sir, we have found one bag...

84
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:26,291
Heart aspires to be with the birds,

85
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:31,958
Like a butterfly in the sky.

86
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:36,916
We shall fly high to catch the sun.

87
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:41,416
We will achieve our goal.

88
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:45,791
Let us fly...

89
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:47,958
Let us fly...

90
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:53,041
Let us fly a bit.

91
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:58,208
Let us stretch our wings,

92
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:03,625
Let us fly like that.

93
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:08,958
We also wish to see all this from up there.

94
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:10,791
Let us fly...

95
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,500
We have started to fly...

96
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:16,041
Let us fly...

97
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:18,833
We have started to fly...

98
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:53,166
As a team leader,

99
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:57,333
returning Kshitij's belongings was my duty.

100
00:11:58,291 --> 00:12:00,333
I had tried this many times before,

101
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:02,583
but...

102
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:12,666
Number does not exist

103
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:17,458
his belongings, a bag and
diary were with me...

104
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:20,083
and Gauri was in front of me.

105
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:23,000
But then seeing her happy in
the world of deaf children,

106
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:24,541
I started thinking...

107
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,250
Whether these belonging
matter to her anymore

108
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:29,000
may be...

109
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:30,958
not now...

110
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:37,666
You wanted to see me.

111
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:41,166
Yes, in a camp... you had met my colleague.

112
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,083
Camp...!

113
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,708
We were impartng search
and rescue tranning,

114
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:45,958
at Kalsi.

115
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:47,875
Oh.. yes...

116
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:49,541
Please... come.

117
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:57,791
He is Kshitij.

118
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:00,375
This was his vision

119
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,375
to change perception of society.

120
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:07,666
Wanted to show that these children

121
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:09,125
are not disabled

122
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:11,500
but are differently abled.

123
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:13,916
Although...

124
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:19,083
we have Disabilities Act
available since 1995

125
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:22,416
but situation has not changed much.

126
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:26,208
Government and families...
both are to be blamed.

127
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:31,166
That is Gurfareen.

128
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:33,333
Her mother had given up.

129
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:37,583
Had no clue about her
schooling.

130
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:41,208
After all most schools
are for normal children.

131
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:43,250
I undersatnd that

132
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:45,500
so true.

133
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:49,625
Heart sings on the note of love.

134
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:54,541
You say and I would interpret.

135
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:59,541
Our world is the world of love.

136
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:04,875
One Sign here does all the magic.

137
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:10,916
Let the silence sing,

138
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:16,083
Let us sing the same.

139
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:21,333
Let us stretch our wings,

140
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:26,416
Let us move like the wind.

141
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:32,208
Our path leads from heart to heart.

142
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:34,041
Let us fly...

143
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,750
We have started to fly...

144
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:39,291
Let us fly...

145
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:41,583
We have started to fly...

146
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:56,291
These children are lively
as long as they are here.

147
00:14:57,125 --> 00:15:02,958
Back home there is no one to talk or play.

148
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:09,375
Deafness is no more a problem.

149
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:12,833
Now early detection is possible

150
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:23,083
and with proper therapy, these
children can lead a normal life.

151
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:29,125
After all something has to be done.

152
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:35,666
So that people look upon them with pride.

153
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:40,666
And that's simple. They
have to reach the top.

154
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:44,250
Have to show something.

155
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:47,000
DipankarPlease come.

156
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:53,791
Dipankar he is Kapil, Kapil he is Dipankar.

157
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:55,083
Our founder member.

158
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:58,583
Nice to meet you.

159
00:15:58,750 --> 00:15:59,458
Please have a seat.

160
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:04,916
We were five.

161
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:10,291
Who began this journey with a dream

162
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:13,583
now only two are left.

163
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:17,250
Kshitij loved adventure sports.

164
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:23,208
Actually we had come here to
open an adventure academy.

165
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:30,625
Where these children could prove themselves

166
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:33,458
and give joy to their families.

167
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:37,458
But

168
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:42,250
still chasing dreams.

169
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:47,583
Let's see.

170
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:50,250
We would be blessed one day

171
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,541
and we await that day.

172
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:57,416
Can you help us?

173
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:04,000
May be... little bit.

174
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:08,208
Everyone wanted to go

175
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:12,958
but some were very young and
others parents were apprehensive

176
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:16,375
finally 13 children were selected.

177
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:21,208
With glittering eyes.

178
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:26,000
They have come out fully dressed.

179
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:31,250
Their hands say many stories.

180
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:36,791
If only you can understand.

181
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:43,083
Give us similar stories.

182
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:47,833
Let us also glitter.

183
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:53,041
Let us stretch our wings.

184
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:58,291
Let us step on the cloud.

185
00:17:58,291 --> 00:18:03,708
Yes we have started our journey of dreams.

186
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:11,208
We have started to fly.

187
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:31,166
Welcome to NIM.

188
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:33,750
Thanks Kapil

189
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:37,083
had dreamt of this.

190
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:54,375
Welcome to Nehru Institute
of Mountaineering (NIM)

191
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:22,625
So children welcome to NIM.

192
00:19:58,875 --> 00:19:59,333
Good...

193
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:01,958
after all we too have
social responsibility.

194
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:09,791
Sir

195
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:18,791
Burma bridge and trekking.
What do you say?

196
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:21,458
But sir children have
come for basic course.

197
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:22,625
Actually... Rajendra.

198
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:24,916
Special course instructor

199
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:27,333
I hope you know him.

200
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:28,750
Yes sir...

201
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:30,833
Actually, He had to join yesterday.

202
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:34,041
Got his message just now.
He won't be back soon.

203
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:36,375
Actually... his father is a heart patient.

204
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:49,291
End of 13 dreams before
they actually began.

205
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:58,541
This course... OK

206
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:00,833
after this another course

207
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:03,541
complete that as well.

208
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:07,500
Train others after these courses.

209
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:12,500
You would certainly do that
and become a great trainer

210
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,750
but...

211
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:29,041
There is a little dream.

212
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:37,500
That bud only wants to bloom.

213
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:45,166
Dont know why there are
obstacles everywhere.

214
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:51,083
From the little heartbeats.

215
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:55,500
Veiled in these passing moments.

216
00:21:56,166 --> 00:22:04,125
It is coming from the world of aspirations.

217
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:07,708
It is the aroma of our destination.

218
00:22:10,708 --> 00:22:16,791
Dear Kid, after this course, you
will not be a helpless girl.

219
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:25,958
What are you thinking Mr. Kapil?

220
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:29,416
Sir Dipankar... who is with these children.

221
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:31,875
He knows basics of mountaineering.

222
00:22:32,166 --> 00:22:33,083
But his leg.

223
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,041
Sir, I feel... he won't have
any problem in the campus.

224
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,708
And once the children start to pick up,

225
00:22:40,375 --> 00:22:42,125
We can take care of the
rest in training area.

226
00:22:42,416 --> 00:22:44,291
Everyone around is excited
about this course

227
00:22:45,125 --> 00:22:46,041
particularly the media.

228
00:22:47,041 --> 00:22:48,166
So afterwards there should not be

229
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:50,916
we are there, dont worry.

230
00:22:56,416 --> 00:23:03,375
Attention, get prepared. Wipe out the dust.
Dont wager. Shed tiredness.

231
00:23:03,708 --> 00:23:10,958
Be brave, remain prepared. Be attentive
all the time. March on fearlessly.

232
00:23:11,166 --> 00:23:13,000
March on, march on
Keep marching forward.

233
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,833
Keep going up.

234
00:23:14,833 --> 00:23:18,541
Watch every step, Reach the sky.

235
00:23:18,541 --> 00:23:21,875
March on, march on
Keep marching forward.

236
00:23:22,083 --> 00:23:25,625
Watch every step.
Reach the sky.

237
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:32,791
Roar aloud. Be heard in all directions.
Such should be the battle cry.

238
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,458
With your shoulders up.
Lock your horns and roll on.

239
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:39,875
Be eager to accomplish.
Remove all hindrances.

240
00:23:39,958 --> 00:23:47,125
You are also now the referee.
You have now to get your due share.

241
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:56,416
So you have to march forward.

242
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:58,458
You have to go up.

243
00:23:58,458 --> 00:24:01,916
Watch your steps.
With resolve you have to get your goal.

244
00:24:03,916 --> 00:24:06,875
Dipankar, just ask the kids, how
they found todays training?

245
00:24:15,416 --> 00:24:16,250
Thank you!

246
00:24:20,583 --> 00:24:23,625
She is Hima Ma'm. Has scaled many peaks.

247
00:24:35,416 --> 00:24:38,375
So No communication without him.

248
00:24:43,666 --> 00:24:45,208
Who is to teach?
Me or him?

249
00:24:46,708 --> 00:24:49,458
Meet Dipankar.
Their sign language instructor.

250
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,708
Namaste.

251
00:24:58,666 --> 00:25:01,625
Well children, three things
are must for mountaineering.

252
00:25:03,583 --> 00:25:06,083
Courage, Technique and Passion.

253
00:25:18,208 --> 00:25:20,125
Has diffused entire passion.

254
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,500
Where have you brought them from?

255
00:25:33,166 --> 00:25:33,500
Means?

256
00:25:34,333 --> 00:25:34,750
Means...!

257
00:25:36,416 --> 00:25:38,500
No. It's not possible like this.

258
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,750
First he would learn and then...
would teach the children.

259
00:25:45,333 --> 00:25:46,666
Like this... How.

260
00:25:47,041 --> 00:25:52,166
What Rajendra and you, do in
adventure course is not my concern.

261
00:25:54,375 --> 00:25:55,291
This is basic course.

262
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,666
And you know

263
00:25:58,125 --> 00:26:00,875
these techniques are taught
by direct communication.

264
00:26:03,958 --> 00:26:04,583
Do one thing.

265
00:26:05,625 --> 00:26:09,750
Arrange video classes.
He would see and teach.

266
00:26:10,791 --> 00:26:13,166
To be true, even you would not be required.

267
00:26:16,916 --> 00:26:17,708
Brilliant idea Ma'm.

268
00:26:18,208 --> 00:26:20,250
Why don't you share it with Principal Sir?

269
00:26:20,708 --> 00:26:22,666
Sir, Director Sir has called you.

270
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:24,833
I would be back soon

271
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:28,375
you continue sharing your vast experience.

272
00:26:28,875 --> 00:26:29,416
How...?

273
00:26:30,583 --> 00:26:31,541
You already know.

274
00:26:41,416 --> 00:26:41,958
Good morning, Sir.

275
00:26:43,125 --> 00:26:43,625
Good morning...

276
00:26:44,291 --> 00:26:44,791
have a seat

277
00:26:50,208 --> 00:26:50,500
sir...

278
00:26:50,916 --> 00:26:52,000
So... what about training.

279
00:26:52,416 --> 00:26:55,208
Nice,
Children are enjoying.

280
00:26:55,666 --> 00:26:57,416
Hima Ma'm is taking knotting class.

281
00:26:58,041 --> 00:27:00,166
Good. Once the children
are thorough with basics.

282
00:27:01,083 --> 00:27:02,083
We would invite the media.

283
00:27:02,458 --> 00:27:02,875
Yes, Sir.

284
00:27:04,166 --> 00:27:06,333
Would demonstrate in front of Rock no. 7

285
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:09,000
and be careful. There would
also be national media also.

286
00:27:10,458 --> 00:27:10,791
Sure sir.

287
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,208
Hopping.

288
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,416
Continue hopping.

289
00:27:32,166 --> 00:27:32,791
Keep doing.

290
00:27:35,041 --> 00:27:40,875
Hima's funda of training -
Rough works makes one tough

291
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:46,375
otherwise all right but not
for these special children.

292
00:27:50,416 --> 00:27:51,250
Dipankar, what is this going on?

293
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,250
What can I do?

294
00:27:53,458 --> 00:27:54,041
Let me see.

295
00:27:55,833 --> 00:27:57,041
What is this Ma'm?

296
00:27:58,041 --> 00:27:59,041
Dont you have any emotions?

297
00:27:59,291 --> 00:28:00,000
Emotions...

298
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:01,416
My foot...

299
00:28:03,833 --> 00:28:04,333
Foo. t.

300
00:28:17,208 --> 00:28:19,083
Seem it was a tough class.

301
00:28:21,208 --> 00:28:23,208
Oh, it was short tempered madame's class...

302
00:28:34,541 --> 00:28:42,291
Good... good. Think like these...
you all will go ahead...

303
00:28:43,541 --> 00:28:44,208
Let's begin yoga.

304
00:29:47,958 --> 00:29:51,625
Children would also join us one day, Sure.

305
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:56,166
Looking at them as mountaineers
will change people's perception

306
00:29:56,958 --> 00:29:59,291
and they will get respect instead of pity.

307
00:30:21,166 --> 00:30:22,416
Hello Dipankar.

308
00:30:23,291 --> 00:30:24,250
How is the training going on?

309
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:26,291
They are catching up fast.

310
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,875
Our dream is getting realized.

311
00:30:29,375 --> 00:30:32,500
Oh yes, I forgot to tell you

312
00:30:38,041 --> 00:30:43,583
asking about their well being...

313
00:30:43,958 --> 00:30:44,541
Really

314
00:30:46,333 --> 00:30:46,958
who all...

315
00:30:47,166 --> 00:30:49,833
please... talk with them

316
00:30:50,791 --> 00:30:51,166
please...

317
00:30:56,458 --> 00:30:57,791
Your son Ashish says

318
00:31:01,416 --> 00:31:02,416
to bring home happiness
and make you feel proud.

319
00:31:05,875 --> 00:31:07,291
And make you feel proud.

320
00:31:08,791 --> 00:31:10,208
He has also silently woven a dream

321
00:31:12,166 --> 00:31:13,208
and he has taken a vow

322
00:31:14,958 --> 00:31:16,625
to fulfill this dream.

323
00:31:17,666 --> 00:31:23,958
All my joys are related to you

324
00:31:28,125 --> 00:31:34,916
I have always dreamt with moist eyes.

325
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:45,750
All my joys are related to you

326
00:31:49,958 --> 00:31:56,750
I have always dreamt with moist eyes.

327
00:32:00,833 --> 00:32:08,083
That you reply to my call and
say-What do you say, Mother.

328
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:16,250
That you reply to my call and
say-What do you say, Mother.

329
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,708
This is Gurfareens mother speaking.

330
00:32:24,583 --> 00:32:27,000
She is asking you not to cry.

331
00:32:27,791 --> 00:32:30,375
What if she cannot listen,

332
00:32:30,833 --> 00:32:32,041
but she understands everything.

333
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:47,958
Your silence makes me weep, How
do I overcome this sorrow?

334
00:32:50,333 --> 00:32:59,625
I understand what you tell me, But how
do I tell you what I have to say?

335
00:33:00,833 --> 00:33:10,291
You are my life, Wish I
could give you all joy.

336
00:33:11,708 --> 00:33:19,750
Where ever you may be,
Come I want to embrace you.

337
00:33:23,333 --> 00:33:28,791
Your son says that he is
doing all this for you.

338
00:33:30,083 --> 00:33:33,208
He continues to run despite being tired

339
00:33:35,333 --> 00:33:36,250
just for you.

340
00:33:37,375 --> 00:33:37,958
So...

341
00:33:39,208 --> 00:33:40,791
that you could be proud.

342
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,375
Time has come to show what
these kids have learnt.

343
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,750
To demonstrate, these kids
have prepared a small skit.

344
00:33:54,583 --> 00:33:55,875
A car travelling through
mountain road

345
00:33:57,041 --> 00:33:58,166
meets with an accident

346
00:34:00,708 --> 00:34:02,666
and car falls in a gorge.

347
00:34:05,875 --> 00:34:06,875
To rescue the passengers.

348
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,750
Our basic mountaineering
course trainees come.

349
00:34:35,541 --> 00:34:39,625
These disabled children must
be trained differently?

350
00:34:40,625 --> 00:34:42,583
Firstly... these children are not disabled

351
00:34:43,208 --> 00:34:44,208
they are differently abled.

352
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:46,583
They are just hearing impaired,

353
00:34:47,583 --> 00:34:50,125
but their other senses are
even more developed than us.

354
00:34:51,291 --> 00:34:54,958
Sorry sir.
We had missed out that angle.

355
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,541
Not your mistake.

356
00:34:57,375 --> 00:34:58,375
Most people think that way.

357
00:34:59,083 --> 00:35:00,875
As regards to this training

358
00:35:02,041 --> 00:35:05,291
complete course is designed
specially in sign language.

359
00:35:05,958 --> 00:35:07,000
I'll tell you what's more.

360
00:35:07,833 --> 00:35:09,541
First of this level... in the entire world.

361
00:35:10,833 --> 00:35:12,125
First course of this level?

362
00:35:12,666 --> 00:35:13,125
Yes...

363
00:35:13,375 --> 00:35:14,833
This is the basic course on mountaineering.

364
00:35:15,458 --> 00:35:16,541
After campus training of 20 days

365
00:35:17,291 --> 00:35:20,458
they would be going for
high altitude expedition,

366
00:36:03,375 --> 00:36:04,125
oh... that kid.

367
00:37:12,458 --> 00:37:13,416
Madam... Madam...

368
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:32,000
What does report say, Doctor?

369
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:34,083
You need complete bed rest.

370
00:37:35,166 --> 00:37:37,250
After how many days shall I be
fit for childrens training?

371
00:37:37,875 --> 00:37:39,875
No... Not before two weeks.

372
00:37:42,791 --> 00:37:43,458
Good morning Sir.

373
00:37:43,666 --> 00:37:44,125
Good morning.

374
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:46,291
Hi Dipankar, How are you?

375
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:48,000
That, Doctor will tell.

376
00:37:48,916 --> 00:37:49,916
Sir, shoulder is dislocated.

377
00:37:50,333 --> 00:37:51,708
Also a minor fracture in collar bone.

378
00:37:52,041 --> 00:37:53,625
So... complete bed rest for now.

379
00:37:54,708 --> 00:37:56,541
Is referral required to higher centre?

380
00:37:56,708 --> 00:37:58,416
No Sir. Bed rest is enough.

381
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:00,000
Sir.

382
00:38:01,625 --> 00:38:02,416
What about your hand... Kapil.

383
00:38:04,083 --> 00:38:06,500
Fine Sir.
Would take some time to recover.

384
00:38:08,375 --> 00:38:08,958
So what next?

385
00:38:11,583 --> 00:38:14,375
Sir... I was about to talk
to you regarding this...

386
00:38:15,041 --> 00:38:17,041
Are these children ready
for the expedition?

387
00:38:18,875 --> 00:38:19,500
No Sir.

388
00:38:22,708 --> 00:38:24,625
Rajendra would be back next week only.

389
00:38:25,208 --> 00:38:25,666
Until then.

390
00:38:27,875 --> 00:38:29,666
Sir, I want some more time.

391
00:38:31,083 --> 00:38:31,666
OK

392
00:39:10,541 --> 00:39:11,000
What happend?

393
00:39:12,708 --> 00:39:13,500
Hey what?

394
00:39:13,875 --> 00:39:14,666
Why are you sitting sadly?

395
00:39:20,583 --> 00:39:24,583
Ok, you are sad because Ashish and
Sir got hurt due to your mistake.

396
00:39:25,125 --> 00:39:27,583
Oh no... Nothing will happen. No tension...

397
00:39:28,208 --> 00:39:30,375
Smile... good boy... smile... ok.

398
00:39:30,666 --> 00:39:31,500
Smile...

399
00:39:36,291 --> 00:39:41,208
Your training? Your traning
shall start soon... ok.

400
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:44,583
Sad no... smile... happy OK.

401
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:47,375
Very good... good child.

402
00:39:50,958 --> 00:39:52,375
I am convincing them...

403
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:56,666
but... how is the training going to start?

404
00:40:02,666 --> 00:40:03,666
It was their fate.

405
00:40:05,625 --> 00:40:06,833
It seemed like someone was gone.

406
00:40:08,333 --> 00:40:09,333
But then they were performing quite well.

407
00:40:11,083 --> 00:40:11,916
What if some casualty.

408
00:40:13,041 --> 00:40:13,625
You are right Ma'm.

409
00:40:17,291 --> 00:40:18,625
Sign language trainer is not around.

410
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:21,958
So... first teach him...

411
00:40:22,458 --> 00:40:23,041
and then...

412
00:40:25,458 --> 00:40:26,125
he will teach.

413
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:27,208
Look...

414
00:40:27,916 --> 00:40:29,041
the fact is that.

415
00:40:29,958 --> 00:40:32,041
These children do not deserve training.

416
00:40:33,666 --> 00:40:34,375
I also had a feeling that.

417
00:40:35,458 --> 00:40:37,958
Basic course going to be
very tough for children.

418
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:43,000
But they are catching things fast.

419
00:40:45,125 --> 00:40:45,833
Catching things.

420
00:40:46,708 --> 00:40:50,583
Mr. Matches are not won just by catching.

421
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:53,458
You require balling
and batting as well.

422
00:40:53,833 --> 00:40:57,666
You all would realize
Only after some mishap.

423
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:38,000
Look...

424
00:41:39,833 --> 00:41:46,125
As long as everything goes well,
everyone would cheer Kapil...

425
00:41:47,083 --> 00:41:50,125
But if... anything happens to any child...

426
00:41:50,916 --> 00:41:55,750
then... they would do... Kapil...

427
00:41:58,041 --> 00:42:02,708
and then... how would
you face their parents?

428
00:42:11,875 --> 00:42:13,916
I beg you Sir...

429
00:42:14,791 --> 00:42:16,166
take care of her.

430
00:42:19,083 --> 00:42:20,375
Sir... I am a poor man.

431
00:42:21,083 --> 00:42:23,916
Don't really know how to converse.

432
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:29,000
Please keep this petty sum.

433
00:42:29,583 --> 00:42:33,416
They don't really speak out.

434
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:36,333
Please provide if they ask for anything.

435
00:42:38,083 --> 00:42:40,791
Now she is your responsibility

436
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:44,666
I have never been alone... without her

437
00:42:45,208 --> 00:42:48,208
I alone know how I'm sending her.

438
00:43:31,125 --> 00:43:32,958
Good morning Mr. Kapil.

439
00:43:33,333 --> 00:43:33,791
Good morning.

440
00:43:37,666 --> 00:43:39,250
What happened? No training today.

441
00:43:39,916 --> 00:43:41,083
Training... It's over now.

442
00:43:42,375 --> 00:43:42,875
What do you mean?

443
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:47,500
You were right

444
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:50,166
I took it emotionally

445
00:43:51,583 --> 00:43:54,083
not realizing the consequences
of any mishap with the kids.

446
00:43:55,291 --> 00:43:55,791
Then.

447
00:43:57,958 --> 00:44:00,333
Then... What about those children?
Their dream?

448
00:44:02,291 --> 00:44:03,583
Intentions were good...

449
00:44:04,458 --> 00:44:04,833
but...

450
00:44:06,833 --> 00:44:07,291
then...

451
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:12,083
So finally I am going to request
to cancel this training.

452
00:44:13,041 --> 00:44:14,916
May be will take it up some other
time if its in their destiny.

453
00:44:16,750 --> 00:44:19,958
But then this course is their dream.

454
00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:21,791
But Mr. Kapil...

455
00:44:23,083 --> 00:44:23,916
I think...

456
00:44:25,625 --> 00:44:27,000
you should take another chance.

457
00:44:30,041 --> 00:44:30,625
One chance...

458
00:44:34,958 --> 00:44:35,666
One chance...

459
00:44:40,166 --> 00:44:41,625
One more chance...

460
00:44:45,125 --> 00:44:46,250
but how?

461
00:45:06,791 --> 00:45:07,875
How are you?

462
00:45:09,083 --> 00:45:09,625
Fine...

463
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:13,708
What about the course?

464
00:45:29,208 --> 00:45:30,000
Will begin again.

465
00:45:37,916 --> 00:45:41,291
Never let your dreams die,

466
00:45:41,291 --> 00:45:45,208
You now need your inner self.

467
00:45:45,208 --> 00:45:48,833
Day or night, you never to stop.

468
00:45:48,833 --> 00:45:51,583
You have to rewrite your destiny.

469
00:45:51,583 --> 00:45:53,583
Should be no illusion,

470
00:45:53,583 --> 00:45:55,208
Such has to be your action,

471
00:45:55,208 --> 00:45:59,000
Obstructions should bow before you.

472
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,833
That should be your intention.

473
00:46:00,833 --> 00:46:02,583
Have firm resolve.

474
00:46:02,583 --> 00:46:06,291
None has courage to face you.

475
00:46:06,791 --> 00:46:08,833
So you have to march forward.

476
00:46:08,833 --> 00:46:10,625
You have to go up.

477
00:46:10,625 --> 00:46:11,958
Watch your steps,

478
00:46:11,958 --> 00:46:14,291
With resolve you have to get your goal.

479
00:46:14,291 --> 00:46:16,125
So you have to march forward.

480
00:46:16,125 --> 00:46:17,750
You have to go up.

481
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:19,250
Watch your steps,

482
00:46:19,250 --> 00:46:21,333
With resolve you have to get your goal.

483
00:46:23,791 --> 00:46:25,125
These children are wonderful.

484
00:46:25,833 --> 00:46:26,625
Just have to tell once.

485
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:31,750
They are wonderful from
both heart and mind.

486
00:46:33,666 --> 00:46:35,250
You just have to understand them

487
00:46:37,541 --> 00:46:38,208
and this fact...

488
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:40,166
most people don't understand.

489
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:44,041
Children...

490
00:46:45,250 --> 00:46:47,875
This expedition is a challenge for us.

491
00:46:54,583 --> 00:47:00,500
You have to apply, what all you
have learnt in this training.

492
00:47:10,291 --> 00:47:13,458
Therefore, if you wish to make
a career in mountaineering,

493
00:47:13,875 --> 00:47:15,875
You should complet this
expedition seriously.

494
00:47:23,291 --> 00:47:23,791
And yes...

495
00:47:24,666 --> 00:47:28,000
The best performer will
receive this gorgeous trophy.

496
00:47:38,666 --> 00:47:45,541
Dreams have started to
fly towards destination.

497
00:47:46,416 --> 00:47:53,291
Little brush has started painting joy.

498
00:47:54,291 --> 00:48:01,333
Dreams have started to
fly towards destination.

499
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:08,333
Little brush has started painting joy.

500
00:48:09,041 --> 00:48:15,791
We are going to walk far,
to achieve our dreams.

501
00:48:17,583 --> 00:48:22,208
There is a dream village, somewhere...

502
00:48:22,958 --> 00:48:26,583
That is often visited by the clouds.

503
00:48:27,208 --> 00:48:34,875
It is the well known aroma.

504
00:48:35,875 --> 00:48:39,291
That I feel in the dreams

505
00:48:43,916 --> 00:48:50,250
I Wanted to take children for the
expedition but my hand injury.

506
00:48:50,833 --> 00:48:51,250
Anyways...

507
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,666
Childrens dream was getting
fulfilled I was happy.

508
00:48:58,875 --> 00:48:59,583
Hima,

509
00:49:00,541 --> 00:49:03,041
Whenever you feel it's not safe to proceed

510
00:49:03,791 --> 00:49:04,875
or children won't be able to do.

511
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:07,708
Move back at once. Understood?

512
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:08,750
Yes Sir.

513
00:50:11,541 --> 00:50:13,916
Oh... Rajendra tell them,

514
00:50:14,375 --> 00:50:15,916
They have to carry their own luggage.

515
00:50:18,958 --> 00:50:20,375
Sure ma'm, they will carry it.

516
00:50:30,708 --> 00:50:33,583
Rough work... makes tough...

517
00:50:44,166 --> 00:50:45,000
yes...

518
00:51:33,041 --> 00:51:34,416
Kshitij... I am missing him a lot today.

519
00:51:40,250 --> 00:51:41,458
Don't know why.

520
00:51:42,541 --> 00:51:43,458
I feel something is not right.

521
00:51:44,541 --> 00:51:45,250
Dont worry.

522
00:51:46,916 --> 00:51:47,958
Our children are tough.

523
00:51:49,125 --> 00:51:50,000
That's all right.

524
00:51:51,541 --> 00:51:53,333
But, Kapil should have been with them.

525
00:51:55,875 --> 00:51:57,083
Kapil, If not there

526
00:51:58,416 --> 00:51:59,000
he is here...

527
00:52:00,375 --> 00:52:02,708
Here? What do you mean?

528
00:52:05,083 --> 00:52:06,583
You were looking pretty
cute while laughing.

529
00:52:09,666 --> 00:52:10,500
I couldn't get you...

530
00:52:15,291 --> 00:52:16,333
Kapil is a good man...

531
00:52:31,041 --> 00:52:31,833
and complete too...

532
00:53:13,666 --> 00:53:17,041
Told Kapil... so many times...
Have to be rough,

533
00:53:17,541 --> 00:53:19,125
If not there... then here.

534
00:53:23,916 --> 00:53:26,625
Yes get up, get going.

535
00:53:29,208 --> 00:53:31,041
Should have been at the
camping site by now.

536
00:53:31,125 --> 00:53:34,541
Like this we are not going
to make it before sunset.

537
00:53:36,458 --> 00:53:39,375
We have not come far enough.

538
00:53:39,666 --> 00:53:40,208
Those who...

539
00:53:42,625 --> 00:53:45,500
are not able to continue,
can give up and return...

540
00:53:47,166 --> 00:53:48,416
O Rajendra,

541
00:53:49,083 --> 00:53:51,791
You tell... in their way.

542
00:53:52,583 --> 00:53:54,416
They cannot do the expedition.

543
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,750
Have to get back tomorrow anyway...

544
00:53:56,750 --> 00:53:58,333
So... why not today itself?

545
00:54:04,916 --> 00:54:05,416
Children...

546
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,416
now its not much.

547
00:54:09,416 --> 00:54:11,958
Have courage and keep going.

548
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:16,750
Soon it's going to be gentle and plain.

549
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:17,791
Ok...

550
00:54:18,375 --> 00:54:22,041
We have to complete this expedition.

551
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:29,208
Have to return only after
we are successful.

552
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:30,625
Ok...

553
00:54:34,083 --> 00:54:37,708
Rough work... makes tough...

554
00:54:48,208 --> 00:54:51,500
To excel is your religion.

555
00:54:51,833 --> 00:54:55,166
Mountain is high but not more than you.

556
00:55:02,375 --> 00:55:06,000
To excel is your religion.

557
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,625
Mountain is high but not more than you.

558
00:55:09,625 --> 00:55:11,583
Cross the limits,

559
00:55:11,625 --> 00:55:13,250
Know yourself.

560
00:55:13,250 --> 00:55:16,458
Swear by yourself, never to give up.

561
00:55:16,458 --> 00:55:20,083
They may say what they want,
That should not affect you.

562
00:55:20,083 --> 00:55:23,750
Your heart should reflect courage.

563
00:55:23,750 --> 00:55:31,458
Even though you are alone,
You have to march on and alone.

564
00:55:31,458 --> 00:55:33,291
You have to march forward.

565
00:55:33,291 --> 00:55:35,083
You have to go up.

566
00:55:35,083 --> 00:55:38,750
With resolve you have to get your goal.

567
00:55:38,750 --> 00:55:40,958
You have to march forward.

568
00:55:50,625 --> 00:55:53,833
(FOLK SONG) Fruit Beru
ripens all through the air,

569
00:55:54,083 --> 00:56:02,208
(FOLK SONG) Fruit Kafal however
ripens only in March-April.

570
00:56:03,875 --> 00:56:05,458
Ok, dinner will be ready in some time.

571
00:56:07,833 --> 00:56:09,083
How was it today?

572
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,541
You must be tired.

573
00:56:13,125 --> 00:56:14,416
It was really steep climb.

574
00:56:19,833 --> 00:56:21,125
You are really tough.

575
00:56:31,041 --> 00:56:32,250
Would send it over to us?

576
00:56:34,166 --> 00:56:36,166
What? Enjoying?

577
00:56:40,791 --> 00:56:44,375
Food would be ready in two minutes.
Eat and sleep silently.

578
00:56:45,166 --> 00:56:46,458
And what were you talking about photos?

579
00:56:48,750 --> 00:56:50,583
O... Ma'm

580
00:56:51,208 --> 00:56:52,416
and don't worry about photos.

581
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,500
I would send those. Real good once.

582
00:57:13,958 --> 00:57:18,041
Ma'm, this seems too high...
for the children?

583
00:57:19,625 --> 00:57:21,708
Oh... Its high...?

584
00:57:22,708 --> 00:57:23,750
Now you would tell me.

585
00:57:24,250 --> 00:57:26,083
This is just the basic
course of children...

586
00:57:26,833 --> 00:57:28,958
If it could be lowered a bit.

587
00:57:30,583 --> 00:57:31,791
Mr. Rajendra...

588
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:35,875
This request... better addressed to Kapil.

589
00:57:37,625 --> 00:57:39,208
Would have been far better

590
00:57:39,666 --> 00:57:41,541
if you and Kapil

591
00:57:42,083 --> 00:57:44,666
could do this in some park...
some swing activity.

592
00:57:45,041 --> 00:57:46,750
All this trouble was not required?

593
00:57:47,458 --> 00:57:48,500
If you agree,

594
00:57:48,750 --> 00:57:49,833
we can call it off.

595
00:57:50,166 --> 00:57:52,541
Ma'm you tend to take everything otherwise.

596
00:57:52,750 --> 00:57:53,416
Remember.

597
00:57:54,083 --> 00:57:57,291
To make them tough, You have to be rough.

598
00:57:57,583 --> 00:57:59,500
Ma'm... Over here...

599
00:57:59,916 --> 00:58:02,250
I don't undertand your rough - tough logic.

600
00:58:02,583 --> 00:58:03,125
What if,

601
00:58:03,791 --> 00:58:05,166
one of them has to summit some peak

602
00:58:05,916 --> 00:58:07,583
and the ropes are equally high?

603
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:08,500
Then...

604
00:58:14,125 --> 00:58:14,750
Sir... Sir...

605
00:58:15,416 --> 00:58:17,833
getting late... hurry up...

606
00:58:53,416 --> 00:58:53,916
Hima ma'm...

607
00:58:55,041 --> 00:58:55,541
Hima ma'm...

608
00:58:57,250 --> 00:58:57,750
Hima ma'm...

609
00:58:59,625 --> 00:59:00,250
Rajendra sir...

610
00:59:00,750 --> 00:59:01,375
Rajendra sir...

611
00:59:01,916 --> 00:59:02,625
Rajendra sir...

612
00:59:03,041 --> 00:59:03,666
Rajendra sir...

613
00:59:29,833 --> 00:59:30,666
Hello...

614
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:32,333
Hello... NIM.

615
01:00:13,375 --> 01:00:15,333
Yes Hima... what is the position.

616
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,416
Rajendra... Has face and chest injury.

617
01:00:19,791 --> 01:00:20,458
And you?

618
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,458
Fine Sir... Just knee...

619
01:00:24,958 --> 01:00:26,708
Everything will be fine sir. No problem.

620
01:00:27,750 --> 01:00:30,625
Sir please... ask about the children.

621
01:00:31,208 --> 01:00:33,166
No tension sir. They are children.

622
01:00:33,833 --> 01:00:36,583
Were a bit disturbed. They are normal now.

623
01:00:37,375 --> 01:00:39,583
Sir, moving Rajendra.
Two porters are with him.

624
01:00:40,083 --> 01:00:42,708
Would reach the road head in 7 - 8 hours.

625
01:00:43,541 --> 01:00:44,541
What's your program?

626
01:00:45,416 --> 01:00:46,125
Continue Sir.

627
01:00:46,791 --> 01:00:47,791
Take care of children.

628
01:00:48,083 --> 01:00:49,000
All the best Hima.

629
01:00:49,333 --> 01:00:50,041
Right sir.

630
01:00:57,750 --> 01:01:00,333
By day after, others would join you.

631
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,375
Then you have to complete the expedition

632
01:01:03,916 --> 01:01:05,375
and hoist the flag...

633
01:01:05,833 --> 01:01:06,333
ok.

634
01:01:06,458 --> 01:01:07,000
Hey...

635
01:01:07,708 --> 01:01:09,375
Hope you are not staying back.

636
01:01:11,208 --> 01:01:12,291
And put this phone on charging.

637
01:02:01,583 --> 01:02:02,166
What's the matter,

638
01:02:04,333 --> 01:02:06,500
Ma'm... Got hurt.

639
01:02:06,833 --> 01:02:07,708
How it happened?

640
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:08,916
Want to sing a song?

641
01:02:12,291 --> 01:02:15,375
This is nothing... Solid mountaineer.

642
01:02:16,333 --> 01:02:18,375
Go and get into your tents,

643
01:02:19,125 --> 01:02:20,250
Nobody should get out.

644
01:02:20,875 --> 01:02:21,833
Not even to piss...

645
01:02:22,166 --> 01:02:22,625
get lost?

646
01:02:24,166 --> 01:02:24,625
Go...

647
01:02:35,791 --> 01:02:36,750
want to do expedition!

648
01:02:48,625 --> 01:02:49,708
Want to do expedition!

649
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:09,250
Ramesh, just check body temperature.

650
01:03:17,458 --> 01:03:17,958
Sir...

651
01:05:45,416 --> 01:05:49,750
You gave me CPR

652
01:05:55,541 --> 01:05:56,666
saved me...

653
01:06:04,083 --> 01:06:05,000
Thank you.

654
01:06:12,791 --> 01:06:13,708
You children...

655
01:06:16,625 --> 01:06:17,791
how to communicate!

656
01:06:25,875 --> 01:06:27,000
I love you...

657
01:06:30,625 --> 01:06:31,416
I love you...

658
01:06:32,916 --> 01:06:33,625
I love you...

659
01:06:49,250 --> 01:06:50,791
Nothing... You leave.

660
01:06:51,583 --> 01:06:53,000
Go... Go to your tents.

661
01:06:53,875 --> 01:06:54,541
Nothing has happened.

662
01:06:55,166 --> 01:06:56,750
You go... go.

663
01:06:57,583 --> 01:06:59,125
Yes... Go.

664
01:07:02,375 --> 01:07:03,291
What has happen to this?

665
01:07:03,833 --> 01:07:07,166
There are three ways of saving
injured person in the mountains.

666
01:07:07,541 --> 01:07:08,875
First provide first aid.

667
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,250
After that, send message for rescue.

668
01:07:13,041 --> 01:07:13,833
And third...

669
01:07:14,458 --> 01:07:17,041
Imediately prepare to
move the injured person.

670
01:07:41,208 --> 01:07:41,791
Hello...

671
01:07:42,625 --> 01:07:43,250
Hello Sir.

672
01:07:43,375 --> 01:07:44,833
You have a long life.

673
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:46,791
I did not follow you.

674
01:07:47,166 --> 01:07:48,666
We were talking about you only

675
01:07:49,166 --> 01:07:50,083
I was telling them

676
01:07:50,666 --> 01:07:52,291
anyone other then Hima,

677
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:54,000
Would have abandoned the course mid way

678
01:07:54,416 --> 01:07:55,666
but It is your courage,

679
01:07:55,958 --> 01:07:58,666
that despite being
injured, you are continuing the course.

680
01:07:59,250 --> 01:08:01,875
Petwal with two porters
would start in a while.

681
01:08:02,125 --> 01:08:04,041
By tomorrow noon they would reach you.

682
01:08:04,375 --> 01:08:05,416
Till then you take rest.

683
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:08,541
Now its a challenge for you, Hima.

684
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,666
But Sir
There seems problem with my leg...

685
01:08:11,166 --> 01:08:12,875
You have to arrange for
helicopter rescue Sir.

686
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:15,875
Please Sir, it's serious.

687
01:08:17,375 --> 01:08:17,875
Hello...

688
01:08:19,291 --> 01:08:19,833
Hello...

689
01:08:21,625 --> 01:08:22,208
Hello...

690
01:08:24,166 --> 01:08:24,750
Hello...

691
01:08:25,583 --> 01:08:26,125
Sir...

692
01:08:26,541 --> 01:08:27,208
Hello Sir.

693
01:08:31,375 --> 01:08:32,500
Oh, what do I do now?

694
01:08:45,833 --> 01:08:49,458
Officials of the institute are
shying away from these questions.

695
01:08:53,750 --> 01:08:56,125
Be what, we have to
continue the expedition.

696
01:09:03,583 --> 01:09:04,166
Petwal.

697
01:09:04,833 --> 01:09:05,416
Yes Sir...

698
01:09:05,666 --> 01:09:06,666
when are you leaving?

699
01:09:06,916 --> 01:09:09,208
Just getting things issued

700
01:09:13,375 --> 01:09:14,250
I will have to leave.

701
01:09:23,458 --> 01:09:24,625
If I dont leave in time...

702
01:09:25,916 --> 01:09:26,666
My leg...

703
01:09:27,666 --> 01:09:28,291
No... not that.

704
01:09:32,833 --> 01:09:34,125
No... I would have to leave.

705
01:09:37,541 --> 01:09:38,416
But... children.

706
01:10:37,666 --> 01:10:38,333
Children...

707
01:10:39,958 --> 01:10:42,208
I would have to move.

708
01:10:43,291 --> 01:10:45,208
Another team would come by tomorrow.

709
01:10:46,083 --> 01:10:47,125
You have to...

710
01:10:48,833 --> 01:10:50,458
complete the expedition.

711
01:10:55,375 --> 01:10:56,125
In a way that is right...

712
01:10:57,625 --> 01:10:59,208
Nobody would be around now to scold you.

713
01:11:01,833 --> 01:11:02,583
No children...

714
01:11:03,916 --> 01:11:04,666
you stay here

715
01:11:06,666 --> 01:11:07,416
but If I stay,

716
01:11:08,750 --> 01:11:09,833
I will lose my leg,

717
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:10,833
and...

718
01:11:11,750 --> 01:11:12,500
remember...

719
01:11:13,041 --> 01:11:14,541
you are not alone.

720
01:11:15,958 --> 01:11:18,250
Entire group is togther

721
01:11:19,666 --> 01:11:22,500
you have to complete your expedition

722
01:11:22,958 --> 01:11:25,208
we will celebrate...

723
01:11:26,333 --> 01:11:26,916
ok.

724
01:11:27,625 --> 01:11:28,166
And...

725
01:11:30,208 --> 01:11:31,458
please click photos for me.

726
01:11:33,791 --> 01:11:41,041
Smile has come back again.

727
01:11:41,375 --> 01:11:46,458
Eyes have indicated.

728
01:11:46,791 --> 01:11:52,125
Someone dear has come back.

729
01:11:52,291 --> 01:11:57,375
Eyes have indicated.

730
01:11:57,708 --> 01:12:03,041
Someone dear has come back.

731
01:12:04,083 --> 01:12:09,000
One who has lost, has come back.

732
01:12:09,666 --> 01:12:13,666
One who has lost, has come back.

733
01:12:14,125 --> 01:12:22,583
Heart has heard, what you said.

734
01:12:25,041 --> 01:12:33,541
Love is our only language.

735
01:12:36,083 --> 01:12:43,125
We are also like you, we are no different.

736
01:12:44,041 --> 01:12:51,083
We are also like you, we are no different.

737
01:13:18,958 --> 01:13:20,291
Why are you following me?

738
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,625
Don't want to complete the expedition?

739
01:13:26,750 --> 01:13:28,666
That is your dream...

740
01:13:29,166 --> 01:13:31,000
You have to fulfil that...

741
01:13:31,583 --> 01:13:33,208
That's your future...

742
01:13:36,458 --> 01:13:39,041
After a while there is a waterfall.

743
01:13:39,875 --> 01:13:41,708
From there... through the caves...
there is a short cut.

744
01:13:45,958 --> 01:13:48,958
After that down slope...
there come a river.

745
01:13:52,833 --> 01:13:55,041
Rafters keep coming upto that place.

746
01:13:55,958 --> 01:13:59,125
Your Ma'm has to reach there.

747
01:13:59,625 --> 01:14:02,000
Don't get emotional, You go back now.

748
01:14:24,333 --> 01:14:28,291
And there is no sign
language trainer with them.

749
01:14:58,333 --> 01:15:01,000
Weather is very unpredictable
at such heights

750
01:15:01,208 --> 01:15:05,083
and Hima herself is injured

751
01:15:05,333 --> 01:15:07,666
and there is no communication.

752
01:15:21,958 --> 01:15:23,416
And for our viewers,

753
01:15:29,875 --> 01:15:31,458
and this if the weather is favorable.

754
01:15:32,291 --> 01:15:39,416
Where ever you may be, come
I want to embrace you.

755
01:15:39,791 --> 01:15:47,500
My life revolves round you.

756
01:15:50,916 --> 01:15:58,583
I await your return.

757
01:16:01,833 --> 01:16:09,166
When would you say, Hide
me in your embrace, Mother.

758
01:16:10,083 --> 01:16:16,958
When would you say, Hide
me in your embrace, Mother.

759
01:16:20,083 --> 01:16:23,125
Petwal was sent in place
of injured Rajendra,

760
01:16:24,250 --> 01:16:27,708
it was decided that expedition will
begin as soon as he reaches there.

761
01:16:28,833 --> 01:16:31,250
It was a routine change of
plans for mountaineers like us

762
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,708
but for Gauri... it was not.

763
01:16:36,416 --> 01:16:37,541
Childrens expedition...

764
01:16:41,625 --> 01:16:43,166
Dreams of so many are attached to this.

765
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:46,458
Of their parents

766
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:48,083
our's...

767
01:16:49,958 --> 01:16:50,458
and...

768
01:16:52,250 --> 01:16:53,041
Kshitij.

769
01:16:55,875 --> 01:16:56,208
You know...

770
01:16:57,750 --> 01:16:59,250
I can still feel him around...
in my dreams.

771
01:17:01,333 --> 01:17:03,916
Often enquires... about children

772
01:17:04,583 --> 01:17:05,666
about our dreams

773
01:17:09,625 --> 01:17:13,125
I know he is not going to return

774
01:17:17,291 --> 01:17:18,041
but don't know why...

775
01:17:21,500 --> 01:17:22,708
I still keep waiting...

776
01:17:27,041 --> 01:17:27,541
had...

777
01:17:29,458 --> 01:17:30,833
had they searched properly...

778
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:35,291
May be... he would have been with us

779
01:17:36,375 --> 01:17:41,333
have just a few photographs of Kshitij...
taken before he was lost

780
01:17:44,250 --> 01:17:45,208
and... Nothing else...

781
01:17:46,333 --> 01:17:47,625
Nothing else...

782
01:17:55,458 --> 01:17:55,875
Gauri...

783
01:17:57,625 --> 01:17:58,291
You dont worry.

784
01:18:00,125 --> 01:18:01,208
Petwal is going

785
01:18:01,708 --> 01:18:03,083
and Hima is already there.

786
01:18:04,125 --> 01:18:07,583
This media always exaggerates situations.

787
01:18:10,791 --> 01:18:12,541
Children are safe.

788
01:18:13,916 --> 01:18:14,416
Trust me.

789
01:18:26,208 --> 01:18:36,875
It is the well -known aroma...

790
01:18:37,708 --> 01:18:43,250
That I feel in the dreams.

791
01:18:44,625 --> 01:18:50,166
That I feel in the dreams.

792
01:18:50,541 --> 01:19:01,208
It is the well -known aroma...

793
01:19:01,791 --> 01:19:07,333
That I feel in the dreams.

794
01:19:08,583 --> 01:19:14,125
That I feel in the dreams.

795
01:19:31,791 --> 01:19:34,708
Put together every bit of courage.

796
01:19:35,375 --> 01:19:38,916
Leave behind all fear.

797
01:19:39,208 --> 01:19:42,541
Make the best attempt.

798
01:19:42,833 --> 01:19:46,166
Tear off all obstructions.

799
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,916
Put together every bit of courage.

800
01:19:50,583 --> 01:19:54,125
Leave behind all fear.

801
01:19:54,416 --> 01:19:57,750
Make the best attempt.

802
01:19:58,041 --> 01:20:01,375
Tear off all obstructions.

803
01:20:02,375 --> 01:20:05,708
Have sight of your goal.

804
01:20:05,958 --> 01:20:09,291
And trace your path.

805
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:13,333
Mountains do move.

806
01:20:13,916 --> 01:20:17,250
You have to gather strength.

807
01:20:17,666 --> 01:20:21,000
Who would stop you.

808
01:20:21,625 --> 01:20:24,958
Gather your strength.

809
01:20:25,208 --> 01:20:28,541
Put together every bit of courage.

810
01:20:28,875 --> 01:20:32,208
Leave behind all fear

811
01:20:47,958 --> 01:20:51,291
face the obstructions on your path.

812
01:20:51,875 --> 01:20:55,083
Exhibit your talent to the world.

813
01:20:55,083 --> 01:20:58,416
March on, march on.

814
01:20:59,625 --> 01:21:02,958
Don't stop, these winds can't move you.

815
01:21:03,291 --> 01:21:06,500
You have now to move ahead with the storm.

816
01:21:06,541 --> 01:21:09,875
March on, march on.

817
01:21:10,916 --> 01:21:14,250
You have to exhibit your passion.

818
01:21:14,708 --> 01:21:18,041
And have to get to your dream.

819
01:21:18,583 --> 01:21:21,916
You have to exhibit your passion.

820
01:21:22,333 --> 01:21:25,666
And have to get to your dream.

821
01:21:26,125 --> 01:21:29,458
Who would stop you.

822
01:21:30,125 --> 01:21:33,458
You have to gather strength.

823
01:21:33,708 --> 01:21:36,833
Put together every bit of courage.

824
01:21:37,208 --> 01:21:40,541
Leave behind all fear.

825
01:21:41,208 --> 01:21:44,541
Make the best attempt.

826
01:21:44,833 --> 01:21:48,166
Tear off all obstructions.

827
01:22:00,250 --> 01:22:03,583
What if dreams are not fulfilled?

828
01:22:04,083 --> 01:22:07,416
What if we are not that lucky?

829
01:22:07,875 --> 01:22:11,208
We would place together our dream.

830
01:22:11,750 --> 01:22:14,875
What if there is no help?

831
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:21,500
We have to reach the destination.

832
01:22:22,416 --> 01:22:28,708
We have to do something innovative.

833
01:22:30,208 --> 01:22:33,541
We are not incomplete.

834
01:22:34,083 --> 01:22:36,208
We are not incomplete.

835
01:22:36,250 --> 01:22:39,583
Courage makes us complete.

836
01:22:42,083 --> 01:22:45,416
If it is dark you have to invoke.

837
01:22:45,541 --> 01:22:49,583
Light that is within you.

838
01:22:49,833 --> 01:22:53,083
You have to find answer.

839
01:22:53,250 --> 01:22:57,375
To all the questions they ask.

840
01:22:57,583 --> 01:23:00,666
Challenge your destiny.

841
01:23:00,916 --> 01:23:04,833
You have to have faith in your attempts.

842
01:23:05,083 --> 01:23:08,250
You have to shine like sun.

843
01:23:08,375 --> 01:23:11,875
And have to create history.

844
01:23:12,250 --> 01:23:15,916
Make courage your tool

845
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:20,125
and you would celebrate success.

846
01:23:20,250 --> 01:23:22,083
Why do you stop?

847
01:23:22,166 --> 01:23:23,833
What do you fear?

848
01:23:24,125 --> 01:23:27,458
Get up and have resolve.

849
01:23:27,958 --> 01:23:31,750
You have to get to your goal.

850
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:36,125
Have sight of your goal.

851
01:23:37,500 --> 01:23:41,041
Who would stop you.

852
01:23:41,375 --> 01:23:44,708
Gather your strength.

853
01:23:45,125 --> 01:23:48,166
Put together every bit of courage.

854
01:23:48,916 --> 01:23:51,958
Leave behind all fear.

855
01:23:52,666 --> 01:23:55,708
Make the best attempt.

856
01:23:56,208 --> 01:23:58,708
Tear off all obstructions.

857
01:25:11,125 --> 01:25:18,041
You all did far more then I could have

858
01:25:20,791 --> 01:25:21,750
to tell you the truth...

859
01:25:25,250 --> 01:25:26,833
I could't understand you...

860
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:31,083
If I was in your position...

861
01:25:32,750 --> 01:25:34,250
I would have completed the expedition.

862
01:25:37,625 --> 01:25:40,041
You all are really great.

863
01:25:41,500 --> 01:25:43,125
You are my silent heroes.

864
01:25:44,708 --> 01:25:47,375
Hima salutes you.

865
01:25:51,041 --> 01:25:53,125
Come on... go get some wood,

866
01:25:54,250 --> 01:25:56,208
We shall have fire. It is very cold.

867
01:25:56,625 --> 01:25:58,041
Go... go...

868
01:25:58,791 --> 01:25:59,416
go...

869
01:26:39,208 --> 01:26:42,166
Now its all over My leg.

870
01:27:00,291 --> 01:27:02,625
Now all over...

871
01:28:54,250 --> 01:28:58,541
Sir, location is shown

872
01:28:58,916 --> 01:29:02,791
8 km from rafting site on
Dayara Bugyal trekking route.

873
01:29:06,583 --> 01:29:07,416
Over here?

874
01:29:07,916 --> 01:29:08,666
But why?

875
01:29:09,833 --> 01:29:12,083
Is it some other location...

876
01:29:18,541 --> 01:29:20,916
Then this new location? And children?

877
01:30:22,166 --> 01:30:22,625
Bisht.

878
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:23,791
Yes Sir.

879
01:30:23,958 --> 01:30:25,375
You proceed with a team for recce.

880
01:30:25,875 --> 01:30:26,333
Right Sir.

881
01:30:26,875 --> 01:30:27,833
Be prepared for rescue.

882
01:30:28,666 --> 01:30:29,125
Ok Sir.

883
01:30:29,291 --> 01:30:29,875
Kapil.

884
01:30:30,458 --> 01:30:32,125
You monitor Rajendra's team.

885
01:30:33,041 --> 01:30:34,625
Inform me after connecting with them.

886
01:30:34,750 --> 01:30:35,500
Right Sir.

887
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:40,208
Sir, can I also go till the rafting site?

888
01:32:40,666 --> 01:32:41,333
Yes..

889
01:32:43,333 --> 01:32:44,000
Where did you reach?

890
01:32:44,500 --> 01:32:45,625
Sir crossed Harsil.

891
01:32:45,791 --> 01:32:48,791
OK. How is Rajendra?

892
01:32:51,916 --> 01:32:53,208
Still unconscious Sir

893
01:32:53,208 --> 01:32:54,041
ok...

894
01:32:55,083 --> 01:32:58,291
Call me again as you are
about to reach the hospital.

895
01:32:58,458 --> 01:32:59,291
Right Sir.

896
01:34:31,500 --> 01:34:36,083
Oh..You were the leader of
that search and rescue team.

897
01:34:38,125 --> 01:34:41,833
That neither searched nor rescued.

898
01:34:43,791 --> 01:34:47,583
You would have considered
him dead the very first day.

899
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:58,333
Search... Just a formality.
And the mission is over...

900
01:35:03,458 --> 01:35:04,416
He did not die.

901
01:35:10,416 --> 01:35:11,875
You murdered him.

902
01:35:14,333 --> 01:35:17,875
Your negligence killed him...

903
01:35:25,166 --> 01:35:28,875
It's good you were not sent
to search the children.

904
01:35:30,041 --> 01:35:31,416
Otherwise once again...

905
01:35:38,708 --> 01:35:41,583
Hope others are not like you...

906
01:35:43,666 --> 01:35:47,250
Hope once again I am not kept in dark.

907
01:35:53,625 --> 01:35:55,125
This time I would go myself...

908
01:35:56,333 --> 01:35:57,458
To rescue my children...

909
01:36:04,750 --> 01:36:06,000
and would return only with them...

910
01:36:08,958 --> 01:36:09,791
otherwise...

911
01:36:17,041 --> 01:36:18,666
What was my crime?

912
01:36:19,375 --> 01:36:22,708
I should have returned
that bag in school only...

913
01:36:23,208 --> 01:36:24,916
Then there would have
been neither this diary

914
01:36:25,375 --> 01:36:28,083
or nor those 13 innocent dreams.

915
01:38:13,541 --> 01:38:14,333
What's the matter Sir?

916
01:38:14,833 --> 01:38:17,000
Many undelivered parcels these days...

917
01:42:47,791 --> 01:42:48,666
I am a guide Sir,

918
01:42:48,916 --> 01:42:49,708
But...

919
01:42:50,166 --> 01:42:50,625
you.

920
01:42:50,916 --> 01:42:51,583
From NIM.

921
01:42:52,333 --> 01:42:53,458
Have come for rescue of one of our group.

922
01:42:53,791 --> 01:42:54,333
Oh...

923
01:42:54,875 --> 01:42:55,333
Anyway...

924
01:42:56,916 --> 01:42:57,416
Ma'm...

925
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,083
I suggest, you wait out here...

926
01:43:00,625 --> 01:43:01,375
and we proceed.

927
01:43:01,958 --> 01:43:04,958
But sir, can't I proceed further with you?

928
01:43:05,208 --> 01:43:06,541
Ma'm its a steep climb ahead

929
01:43:07,250 --> 01:43:07,791
like this.

930
01:43:09,166 --> 01:43:10,666
Let's finish the inspection.

931
01:43:11,833 --> 01:43:12,375
Would decide after that...

932
01:43:13,541 --> 01:43:13,958
Joshi...

933
01:43:14,541 --> 01:43:14,875
Let's proceed...

934
01:45:28,625 --> 01:45:29,416
Hey... Hi.

935
01:45:30,541 --> 01:45:31,250
Hello... Here.

936
01:45:48,083 --> 01:45:48,500
Jaideep.

937
01:45:50,916 --> 01:45:51,583
Tarun...

938
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:57,666
Tarun...

939
01:47:09,500 --> 01:47:10,041
Tarun...

940
01:47:11,583 --> 01:47:12,375
Tarun... Look here.

941
01:47:29,333 --> 01:47:31,791
My children you are very intelligent...

942
01:47:32,791 --> 01:47:34,500
I love you so much.

943
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:40,041
Yes...

944
01:47:42,625 --> 01:47:44,125
Ma'm, children are on
other side of the river,

945
01:47:44,458 --> 01:47:45,375
Please call them... to this side...

946
01:47:45,750 --> 01:47:48,041
Water current is very fast in the middle.

947
01:47:48,375 --> 01:47:49,500
They would not be able to manage this.

948
01:47:50,375 --> 01:47:53,583
Ma'm there is a dangerous rapid ahead.

949
01:47:54,666 --> 01:47:55,208
What?

950
01:48:01,250 --> 01:48:02,000
Dangerous rapid?

951
01:48:02,208 --> 01:48:03,416
Call them this side fast Ma'm.

952
01:48:05,500 --> 01:48:07,541
Only experienced rafters can cross that.

953
01:48:10,791 --> 01:48:11,375
Tarun...

954
01:49:21,708 --> 01:49:23,166
Dont cry . Dont cry.

955
01:49:48,416 --> 01:49:51,166
Tarun, come this side.

956
01:49:57,750 --> 01:49:58,541
Tarun.

957
01:50:12,750 --> 01:50:13,791
Kapil.

958
01:50:17,166 --> 01:50:18,208
Kapil.

959
01:50:59,958 --> 01:51:00,750
Kapil...

960
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:02,750
Thanks.

961
01:51:03,375 --> 01:51:05,541
Ma'm... emotions!

962
01:51:34,250 --> 01:51:36,375
Emotions my foot.

963
01:51:40,500 --> 01:51:41,666
First he will learn...

964
01:51:42,708 --> 01:51:43,708
and then he will teach.

965
01:51:48,500 --> 01:51:49,583
Everyone go inside your tents

966
01:51:50,291 --> 01:51:51,416
dont come out,

967
01:51:52,041 --> 01:51:52,958
not even to piss

968
01:51:53,375 --> 01:51:53,625
get lost...

969
01:51:58,166 --> 01:51:59,500
Come on... be fast...

970
01:52:01,333 --> 01:52:02,458
want to do expedition!

971
01:52:06,041 --> 01:52:08,916
And because of her unprofessional attitude,

972
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:44,833
Kshitijs dreams.

973
01:52:45,333 --> 01:52:47,125
That people look upon them with pride...

974
01:52:47,666 --> 01:52:49,500
You would tell better if
the same was realised.

975
01:52:49,666 --> 01:52:50,250
But then...

976
01:52:50,750 --> 01:52:54,875
I am dreaming right now of the next
training for these children...

977
01:52:59,166 --> 01:53:03,958
These roads are the same, Same is the view.

978
01:53:04,291 --> 01:53:09,250
But that time is lost somewhere.

979
01:53:09,541 --> 01:53:14,500
Silence has just passed by the ears.

980
01:53:14,791 --> 01:53:19,208
Perhaps something was said mildly.

981
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:24,791
These roads are the same, Same is the view.

982
01:53:25,333 --> 01:53:30,291
But that time is lost somewhere.

983
01:53:30,541 --> 01:53:35,750
Silence has just passed by the ears.

984
01:53:35,750 --> 01:53:40,125
Perhaps something was said mildly

985
01:53:40,208 --> 01:53:45,250
it is the well known aroma.

986
01:53:45,875 --> 01:53:53,250
That I feel in the dreams.

987
01:53:56,916 --> 01:54:01,541
There is a dream village, somewhere...

988
01:54:02,291 --> 01:54:05,916
That is often visited by the clouds.

989
01:54:06,666 --> 01:54:14,541
It is the well known aroma.

990
01:54:15,416 --> 01:54:18,833
That I feel in the dreams.

991
01:54:33,750 --> 01:54:40,625
Dreams have started to
fly towards destination.

992
01:54:41,500 --> 01:54:48,375
Little brush has started painting joy.

993
01:54:49,375 --> 01:54:56,416
Dreams have started to
fly towards destination.

994
01:54:57,083 --> 01:55:03,416
Little brush has started painting joy.

995
01:55:04,125 --> 01:55:10,875
We are going to walk far,
to achieve our dreams.

996
01:55:12,666 --> 01:55:17,291
There is a dream village, somewhere...

997
01:55:18,041 --> 01:55:21,666
That is often visited by the clouds.

998
01:55:22,291 --> 01:55:26,541
It is the well known aroma.

999
00:01:24,666 --> 00:01:29,708
One who teaches others
to save themselves is stuck himself today.

1000
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:59,416
This deaf school teacher used to dream of
making these children someone special..

1001
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:19,666
All this... because We really don't know
how to respond in emergency.

1002
00:08:57,916 --> 00:09:03,916
Search & rescue operation began
when Kshitijs group did not return.

1003
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:59,375
Till date we used to organize only adventure
courses for children with special needs

1004
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:06,500
but now we are going to start for the first time,
a basic mountaineering course for deaf children.

1005
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:39,000
We spoke with their parents regarding this
course.

1006
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:45,041
When he was very young, he used to
watch other kids go to school and cry

1007
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:50,583
and today he has gone to do
this big course, all alone.

1008
00:36:59,625 --> 00:37:03,666
This is a concern for the parents,
school and the whole deaf community

1009
00:37:03,833 --> 00:37:09,750
because this course will decide whether
such courses are feasible or not.

1010
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:14,125
Finally the day has arrived, which
we all have been waiting for.

1011
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:18,541
Group of children has begun
their high altitude expedition.

1012
00:49:19,208 --> 00:49:22,208
Let us give you some details
of this expedition.

1013
00:49:22,208 --> 00:49:25,083
After 6 hours road journey from Uttarkashi,

1014
00:49:25,083 --> 00:49:28,958
Children will trek through
high Himalayan passes,

1015
00:49:29,333 --> 00:49:33,125
Children shall complete their training
by hoisting flags on these heights.

1016
01:01:31,833 --> 01:01:34,458
He is benig moved to Uttarkashi.

1017
01:01:34,750 --> 01:01:38,250
What caused the accident and
whether the children are safe?

1018
01:01:38,583 --> 01:01:41,750
There is nothing to worry.
Children are perfectly safe.

1019
01:01:43,041 --> 01:01:45,250
Our another team would
reach there by tomorrow.

1020
01:14:21,125 --> 01:14:24,208
Group of 13 deaf children is
stranded in the Himalayas.

1021
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:43,083
Mr. Dipankar, right now only
team leader Hima is there.

1022
01:14:43,416 --> 01:14:48,916
She does not know sign language.
How will she manage them?

1023
01:14:49,708 --> 01:14:51,416
These children have spent some
time with her during training.

1024
01:15:12,791 --> 01:15:14,166
God forbid. Nothing of
that sort should happen.

1025
01:52:09,083 --> 01:52:11,625
Indian Mountaineering and rescue
federation has suspended Hima.

1026
01:52:37,541 --> 01:52:41,208
That their names would be
recommended for President's Award.

1027
01:52:41,750 --> 01:52:43,958
We spoke to their trainer, Kapil.

1028
01:53:30,541 --> 01:53:40,125
You can see this raft made by the kids. You can see
how it was made. It is not a professional raft...

1029
01:54:04,125 --> 01:54:10,833
I really doubt if normal children could have done
what these kids have done. They are extra ordinary.

1030
01:54:19,916 --> 01:54:27,958
May be this first film of it's kind and we
are all proud to be associated with it.

1031
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:50,958
Group of 13 children from Bajaj Institute of Learning, Dehradun has
reached NIM, Uttarkashi, for special training and mountaineering mission.

1032
01:14:28,291 --> 01:14:39,000
To understand problems and safety concerns, we
spoke with their teacher who is still in hospital.

1033
01:15:23,666 --> 01:15:29,500
The children are 2 day trek and 6 hours
of road journey away from Uttarkashi.

1034
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:35,500
Primary objective of this course is to give a direction
to these kid's lives and a new career for them.

1035
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:56,333
He was very happy while leaving,
what else I need as a father.

1036
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,208
We have to give back at least something to
the under privileged segment of the society.

1037
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:15,083
I think... like adventure course these
children should be exposed to river crossing,

1038
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:41,875
So... engage them in some activities
so that they are not disappointed.

1039
00:23:47,333 --> 00:23:54,166
You have to change your life. As it was never
before. You have to do something different.

1040
00:24:23,833 --> 00:24:28,166
She would tell you about knotting.
Knotting means tying ropes together.

1041
00:24:52,916 --> 00:24:56,916
He would be required in the beginning only.
After that children would on their own.

1042
00:28:26,958 --> 00:28:29,791
Yes. It happens after exercise.
You will be fine in couple of days.

1043
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:37,625
Since the time kids have gone,
their parents keep coming here.

1044
00:36:34,916 --> 00:36:39,083
Bad news for those awaiting successful realization
of dreams of 13 deaf kids in mountaineering course.

1045
00:36:39,375 --> 00:36:49,500
Yesterday their sign language trainer got injured in an
accident during training and is admitted in the hospital.

1046
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:54,625
We would like to tell the viewers that a group of
13 deaf children is on a mountaineering course.

1047
00:36:54,875 --> 00:36:59,250
In the light of what has happened, it is
likely that the course may be cancelled.

1048
00:38:32,791 --> 00:38:37,291
Tell me, without completing the training,
how will the kids go on the expedition?

1049
01:01:24,916 --> 01:01:31,166
As per the latest reports sign language trainer Rajendra has
been seriously injured on very second day of the expedition.

1050
01:01:46,833 --> 01:01:51,666
And I assure you that these children would
return only after completing the expedition.

1051
01:08:34,166 --> 01:08:39,541
Has another team gone to get back the children?
Would they be able to complete the expedition?

1052
01:08:39,916 --> 01:08:45,208
A dream that we all saw together...
Would that dream come true?

1053
01:08:57,791 --> 01:09:02,250
Have to prove that our trainees are capable
of saving themselves and also others.

1054
01:14:51,625 --> 01:14:57,833
So they understand each other's expressions,
body language... They can certainly communicate.

1055
01:15:07,791 --> 01:15:12,458
In this situation if there is an emergency
or lets say some child falls sick then?

1056
01:15:14,666 --> 01:15:21,666
We would be in a position to comment only after the second
team reaches there and we talk to children... I mean Hima.

1057
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:16,875
Group of these 13 kids has reached
Dehradun with their teachers and trainers.

1058
01:52:17,166 --> 01:52:21,916
Their dream of completing
the expedition did not materialize.

1059
01:52:22,250 --> 01:52:28,583
Still they have been selected for the advance course based on
their courage, decision making capability and team spirit.

1060
01:52:29,166 --> 01:52:37,291
While felicitating 4 children involved in "Makeshift
Raft Rescue" The Minister of Youth Welfare assured.

1061
01:52:37,316 --> 01:52:53,316
<font color="#ffff80"><b>Hope it helped -> bozxphd</b></font>
