1
00:04:20,494 --> 00:04:24,704
Oi! Jeet! What took you so long?

2
00:04:37,244 --> 00:04:40,191
This is what I imagine
England looks like.

3
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:44,727
England is all slums
and bombsites.

4
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:47,595
- You know why they're letting this go?
- No.

5
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:52,535
The vvar has exhausted them.
They can't afford to keep us.

6
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:55,369
Careful, she'll hear you.

7
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:59,774
Queen Victoria, Empress of India.
She never even set a foot here.

8
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:04,173
Now Mountbatten sahib can finally take
his great-grandmother back home.

9
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:13,357
This is the new recruit, Jeet Kumar.
He's Punjabi, like me.

10
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:16,519
From my village near Lahore.
I have known him since he was a boy.

11
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,529
Very good, sir, very capable.

12
00:05:19,186 --> 00:05:21,757
It is a great honour
to be in Viceroy's House.

13
00:05:22,022 --> 00:05:25,492
I spoke with your last employer
on the telephone this morning.

14
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:29,029
The Governor of Punjab expressed
his regret at losing you.

15
00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:32,699
You'll be working with 
\/Ir Gupta
in the inner circle.

16
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,280
We are responsible for the personal
care of the Viceroy.

17
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:39,317
It is a position of great trust,
you understand?

18
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:40,373
Yes, sir.

19
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:42,017
A privilege.

20
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:45,747
Mountbatten sahib is a heroic man.
He freed Burma.

21
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:46,786
Indeed.

22
00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:48,720
Now he has come to free India.

23
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:54,493
You think you Indians are ready
to run your own civil service?

24
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:56,200
Courts of law?

25
00:05:56,623 --> 00:05:58,796
Your own armed forces?

26
00:05:59,226 --> 00:06:01,069
We've learnt from the best, sir.

27
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:06,438
I have chosen you, not because of
your vast experience,

28
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:09,480
but because The Honourable
Pamela Mountbatten is 18

29
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:12,614
and might appreciate your youth.

30
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:16,283
But what about my duties here?

31
00:06:18,078 --> 00:06:20,456
This is an honour I am giving you.

32
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:22,485
Yes, ma'am.

33
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:29,362
The men translate for statesmen while
we translate chitchat for English child.

34
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:30,992
I hear she's friends with
Princess Elizabeth.

35
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,331
Protocol - stand to attention
when they pass.

36
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,497
Then she'll be looking clovvn
her long Mountbatten nose at...

37
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:37,635
Oi, sala, move.

38
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:39,176
Stop staring at them.

39
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,204
Aalia?

40
00:06:41,268 --> 00:06:43,475
Sorry, miss. My friend is new.

41
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:45,573
He doesn't know the protocol yet.

42
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:47,710
Aalia, we're late.

43
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:01,021
Wait, sala. Who is she?

44
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:04,000
A Hindu boy like you
and a Muslim girl?

45
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:08,233
I knew her father when he was in jail
in Lahore.

46
00:07:09,296 --> 00:07:11,173
You started out as a policeman?

47
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:14,610
Yes, sir. I have been under-valet
for two years.

48
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:17,539
Why did you leave yourjob?

49
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:21,042
I was working in a jail, sir.

50
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:23,415
Many of our leaders
were in prison there.

51
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:27,219
I found myself unable
to turn keys, sir.

52
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:28,749
And yet...

53
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:32,586
you'd work for the British Viceroy?

54
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,224
He will not be Viceroy for long, sir.

55
00:07:36,156 --> 00:07:37,692
Freedom is coming.

56
00:07:40,093 --> 00:07:43,302
Better to be close to power and watch

57
00:07:43,363 --> 00:07:45,536
than to agitate against it.

58
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:50,573
Hovv else will we step in
when our time comes?

59
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:55,179
What's that? Look, Mizzy.

60
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:57,687
What can you see?
What can you see?

61
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:02,026
That's more like it.

62
00:08:03,183 --> 00:08:06,027
Stop hogging the mirror, Daddy.

63
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:08,724
You know, the Aussies called him
a beaut.

64
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:10,693
And who can deny it?

65
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:15,564
Churchill called this
the worst job in the world.

66
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:19,075
Well, he's wrong.
Burma was the worst job in the world.

67
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:22,376
You're giving a nation back
to its people. Hovv bad can it be?

68
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:25,211
Churchill was wrong about Gandhi too.

69
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:28,309
- What did he call him?
- A half-naked fakir.

70
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:30,350
That's really rather rude.

71
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:36,688
Yes, British Empire brought to
its knees by a man in a loin cloth.

72
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,161
Poor Winston.

73
00:08:38,318 --> 00:08:40,628
He's walking around like a chap
who's swallowed a wasp.

74
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:43,190
Well, he is part of the past, darling.

75
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:44,735
You're bringing the future.

76
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:46,334
We are.

77
00:08:47,594 --> 00:08:49,130
Well...

78
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:52,233
Then let's not make a mess of it.

79
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:12,955
Attention!

80
00:09:30,537 --> 00:09:31,743
Your Excellency.

81
00:09:32,005 --> 00:09:33,484
Not for much longer.

82
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,713
Welcome. You know Lord lsmay,
Chief of Staff.

83
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:38,216
- Pug, good to see you.
- Glad to be on the team.

84
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:40,552
Welcome to the infernal heat, my dear.

85
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:42,115
- Lady Wavell.
- Dickie.

86
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:46,753
I must say, I think it's a little shabby,
the way WhitehaWs ousted you.

87
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:49,466
- Sir? One photo, sir?
- I was always Churchill's man

88
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:51,729
and now At
ee's Labour government
has swept the board.

89
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:54,335
Lord Louis, what do you hope
to achieve?

90
00:09:54,394 --> 00:09:56,431
I have been given
a very specific task.

91
00:09:56,496 --> 00:09:59,170
I am to be the last Viceroy of India

92
00:09:59,232 --> 00:10:02,577
and I shall carry out the role
with great pride.

93
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:09,653
Ah.

94
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:12,145
Oh, this is quite something.

95
00:10:12,212 --> 00:10:13,350
Wonderful!

96
00:10:15,215 --> 00:10:17,126
This is the indoor staff.

97
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,720
Good heavens!

98
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:20,526
Fifty and something, I believe.

99
00:10:20,587 --> 00:10:23,568
On behalf of you all...

100
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:29,367
I'd like to welcome the incoming
Viceroy and his family.

101
00:10:31,064 --> 00:10:36,673
I am sure that you will give them
the same good service

102
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:39,172
that you have always given us.

103
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:48,352
So?

104
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:50,085
Who is he?

105
00:10:51,284 --> 00:10:54,265
My father was jailed for marching
with Gandhiji.

106
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:57,624
My mother and I were not allowed
to visit him,

107
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:01,629
but there was this young
Hindu policeman who helped us.

108
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:07,337
He took letters, food, medicine
for my father.

109
00:11:07,634 --> 00:11:10,171
But your face when you saw him.

110
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,779
I was... I was only surprised
to see him.

111
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:15,542
- Stop making mischief.
- This solves a mystery, Aalia.

112
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:18,680
Sunita, there's nothing between us.

113
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:21,359
Nothing for you, maybe.

114
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:23,052
I don't envy you, Dickie.

115
00:11:23,116 --> 00:11:27,292
I tried to solve it, but it's
operation madhouse, if you ask me.

116
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,128
Thousands dead already.

117
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:33,069
Thirty million Hindus and Sikhs
want a united India

118
00:11:33,126 --> 00:11:36,130
but many of the 100 million
Muslims do not.

119
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:39,405
The Muslim minority don't want to be
part of India.

120
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:43,038
They want their own country, Pakistan.

121
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:45,811
There's such rancour between
the leaders now,

122
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:48,349
it's nigh on impossible to get them
in the same room.

123
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:52,379
Well, whatever their differences are,
all Indians have one thing in common.

124
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:55,619
- What's that’?
- They can't wait to get rid of us.

125
00:11:55,682 --> 00:11:58,060
- 
\/Ir Nehru, sir.
- Hm.

126
00:11:58,117 --> 00:12:00,290

\/Ir Nehru and some of the other
leaders were kind enough

127
00:12:00,353 --> 00:12:02,697
to come and meet my plane.
I asked them all to eat with us.

128
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:05,235
It seemed the least I could do.
I hope it's not inconvenient.

129
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:08,295
- Excellency.
- Good afternoon.

130
00:12:08,361 --> 00:12:10,500
- Lord lsmay.
- Hello.

131
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:13,008
My dear, dear Dickie.

132
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:15,012
Panditji, thank you forjoining us.

133
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:19,574
It is always a pleasure to be in the
Viceroy's house and not in his jails.

134
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:21,516
You would not have needed
to be jailed

135
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:24,578
had you not been trying to undermine
us as we fought the Nazis.

136
00:12:24,611 --> 00:12:28,252
We promised you help in return
for independence.

137
00:12:28,348 --> 00:12:29,759
Hovv could we fight Hitler

138
00:12:30,016 --> 00:12:33,463
when our own country was already
under foreign occupation?

139
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,092
2.5 million of your fellow countrymen
found a way.

140
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:40,160
- Those Indians volunteered.
- Indeed.

141
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:43,298
You would not have won
without their sacrifice.

142
00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:45,434
You owe India a great debt.

143
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:48,741
And Panditji owes Cambridge
a great debt

144
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:51,281
for honing his debating skills.

145
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:56,150
There are 34
reception rooms, 34 state rooms,

146
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:58,451
ten private dining rooms, a cinema.

147
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:01,981
Makes Buckingham Palace
look like a bungalow.

148
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:06,754
I'm so hot,
I think I might actually die.

149
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:10,997
Ma'am, here's the food for the dog.

150
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:15,197
Would you take them onto the terrace?
It was such a long journey.

151
00:13:15,395 --> 00:13:17,568
It's just terribly, terribly hot.

152
00:13:18,031 --> 00:13:20,068
Ah, just there, please.

153
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:22,703
What do we have here?

154
00:13:24,704 --> 00:13:27,583
I haven't seen chicken like this
since before rationing.

155
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:32,588
Lady Sahib, if the food is incorrect,
we are very sorry. We will take it away.

156
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,182
No, please, leave it.

157
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:36,789
You don't think...

158
00:13:38,518 --> 00:13:40,259
Why not?

159
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:46,467
Mm.

160
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:52,569
The Order of the Garter,
vvorn singularly

161
00:13:52,632 --> 00:13:56,478
or together with the Order of the Star
of India, depending on the occasion.

162
00:13:56,536 --> 00:13:59,380
If I want to push the boat out,
then I will wear all four.

163
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:01,043
Now to dressing.

164
00:14:01,107 --> 00:14:02,518
We're going to get this down to
a fine art.

165
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:05,579
I never want to spend more than
two minutes dressing.

166
00:14:05,645 --> 00:14:06,521
Yes, Excellency.

167
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:09,992
Not "Excellency" till after
the ceremony. "Sir" will do.

168
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:12,586
Right. Socks, no suspenders.

169
00:14:12,652 --> 00:14:15,132
Braces, leave on the trousers.

170
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:17,099
Have you seen that before?

171
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:18,601
- Hm?
- No, sir.

172
00:14:18,658 --> 00:14:22,128
Hovv much time do we waste
buttoning trousers?

173
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:26,473
One just steps into these and...
The vvhole of the Navy uses them now.

174
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:30,139
This morning I'd say we're pulling out
all the stops.

175
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:31,307
And...

176
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:34,014
Duleep Singh, isn't it?

177
00:14:34,507 --> 00:14:35,383
Yes, sir.

178
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:37,284
Lord Wavell speaks very highly of you.

179
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:41,120
- Thank you, sir. Honour to serve.
- And...?

180
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:44,218
Jeet Kumar, sir. From Punjab.

181
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:45,193
He's the new boy.

182
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:49,097
Well, Kumar, we have something
in common there.

183
00:14:49,122 --> 00:14:50,328
Now...

184
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,499
Are we ready?

185
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:26,259
Thirteen minutes.

186
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:27,095
Hm.

187
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,065
We'll do better ne><t time.

188
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:40,278
l, Louis Francis Albert Victor Nicholas,
Viscount Mountbatten of Burma,

189
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:46,123
do swear true allegiance to our
Sovereign Lord, King George VI,

190
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:51,027
Defender of the Faith,
Emperor of India,

191
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:55,157
and I will faithfully fill the office
of Viceroy of India

192
00:15:55,188 --> 00:15:57,031
according to lavv.

193
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:58,727
May God be my guide.

194
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:11,515
Oi! Have you never seen gories
in fine dresses before?

195
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:14,313
You may be new but you must know
your place.

196
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:18,014
Oi, Mohsin bhai. Leave him be.
He's my friend.

197
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:20,614
You Punjabis always look after
your ovvn.

198
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,126
- You Bengalis...
- Hey! Don't talk like that.

199
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:24,422
Get back to your places.

200
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:32,433
This is not a normal
Viceroyalty on which I am embarking.

201
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:36,404
I am under no illusion about
the difficulty of my task.

202
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:41,274
I shall need the greatest goodwill
of the greatest possible number

203
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:46,672
and I am asking India today
for that goodwill.

204
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,283
Why don't you listen
to what he has to say?

205
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:52,721
Because I've heard it all before.

206
00:16:56,082 --> 00:16:59,427
Ubba, maybe the Ivlountbattens
will be different.

207
00:17:00,286 --> 00:17:01,993
He is the King's cousin.

208
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:05,566
He has empire in his blood.

209
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:15,011
My husband's study
is the first priority.

210
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:19,544
It has to be refurbished.
It needs light and brightness.

211
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:23,018
He says it reeks
of failed negotiations.

212
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:24,688
Consider it done, ma'am.

213
00:17:26,012 --> 00:17:30,518
I'll continue my tour after breakfast,
Miss Reading,

214
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,290
but in the meantime,

215
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:36,292
would you put your heads together
With the ADCs

216
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:38,733
and rethink the guest lists?

217
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:45,567
From now on almost half of all guests
at all occasions must be Indian.

218
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:49,340
- Yes, ma'am.
- Also, I want to meet Indian women.

219
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:50,676
Thank you.

220
00:17:52,305 --> 00:17:56,014
Sarojini Naidu, Pandit Nehru's sister,

221
00:17:56,042 --> 00:18:00,149
Mrs Aruna Ali Asif,
Rajkumari Amrit Kaur.

222
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:03,353
- Have you got that, Miss Noor?
- Yes, ma'am.

223
00:18:03,516 --> 00:18:05,257
Here are the riders.

224
00:18:05,318 --> 00:18:07,127
I have a feeling, Pammy,

225
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:09,962
that might be the only hour of the day
I get to spend with you.

226
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:11,365
Each day is so crammed.

227
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:14,064
Two poached eggs, tomatoes,
sausages, tea.

228
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:15,230
Lots to do.

229
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:19,265
Darling, did you know that 92%
of the population is illiterate?

230
00:18:19,332 --> 00:18:20,072
Good morning.

231
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:24,205
And that one in five babies dies
before they're four months old?

232
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:27,274
Edwina, I could not be blessed
with a more active, able wife,

233
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,183
- but sometimes we have to accept...
- I know.

234
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:30,618
what we cannot change.

235
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:33,054
But we can change a lot, Dickie.

236
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:36,060
We really can,
and we absolutely have to.

237
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:40,586
India's problems are not just political.
They are social and economic.

238
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:44,158
Almost half the babies born here
die before they're five.

239
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:48,535
That cannot be the legacy the British
leave India after three centuries.

240
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:51,370
We have enough time
to improve the infrastructure

241
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,671
- so that when we leave...
- That is not why we're here.

242
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,210
- Yes.
- You'll wear yourself out.

243
00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:58,707
You mean I'll wear you out.

244
00:18:58,771 --> 00:18:59,715
No...

245
00:19:02,275 --> 00:19:04,687
Edwina, I have the governors
arriving from the provinces.

246
00:19:04,944 --> 00:19:07,390
I know. I'm entertaining their wives.

247
00:19:08,381 --> 00:19:11,328
And I'm very grateful
for everything you do.

248
00:19:19,592 --> 00:19:22,095
Miss Hudson, is there something
the matter?

249
00:19:22,395 --> 00:19:26,468
Nothing at all, ma'am, only I do wish
they wouldn't come so close.

250
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:32,674
Perhaps your very able gifts
would be better used in Surrey.

251
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:35,176
I beg your pardon, ma'am?

252
00:19:35,241 --> 00:19:37,653
Would you please pack your bags
and go home?

253
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:56,101
Have you got the papers? I'll need
them for the meeting after this one.

254
00:19:56,162 --> 00:19:57,072
Yes, ma'am.

255
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:03,605
Miss Noor?

256
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:07,550
I have a message for you, from home.

257
00:20:09,475 --> 00:20:10,647
Go on.

258
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:15,557
I had to see you.

259
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:18,523
Hovv is your father?

260
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:22,755
Jeet, what are you doing?
Nothing has changed.

261
00:20:23,022 --> 00:20:25,059
I see you are still unmarried.

262
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:27,537
I am still promised to another.

263
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:36,507
I have tried every day for the past
two years to forget you.

264
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:39,148
Then try harder.

265
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:15,313
The violence is escalating
day by day.

266
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:20,282
This hatred between Hindu, Sikh
and Muslim

267
00:21:20,346 --> 00:21:22,417
is poisoning everything we've built.

268
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:26,623
In Bengal the violence is
compounded by a famine

269
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:31,527
which the people think we are doing
precious little to relieve.

270
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:33,695
The sooner we can hand over
to an Indian government...

271
00:21:35,061 --> 00:21:36,096
the better.

272
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,505
But what government?

273
00:21:37,563 --> 00:21:41,033
These wretched Indian leaders
won't agree.

274
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,774
If the Muslims are
denied their Pakistan

275
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:47,279
my province will
have all-out civil war.

276
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:48,750
The same in the Punjab.

277
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:51,789
The Hindus won't tolerate a Pakistan
they haven't voted for.

278
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:54,115
Oh, God! Gentlemen...

279
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,782
Our saviour is here.

280
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,454
He walks among us.

281
00:21:58,517 --> 00:22:00,190
Off the record, Pug,

282
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:02,994
we're not sure Dickie Ivlountbattews
the man for this job.

283
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:08,129
Look, he has amazing ability
to get along with people.

284
00:22:08,194 --> 00:22:11,767
But these Indians are as slippery
as eels.

285
00:22:12,031 --> 00:22:15,501
The Indians have to believe

286
00:22:15,568 --> 00:22:19,038
that whatever the future of India is,

287
00:22:19,071 --> 00:22:21,176
it is their idea.

288
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,685
And trust me,

289
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:25,278
if anyone can get them to agree,

290
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,085
it's Dickie.

291
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:31,327
He could charm a vulture off a corpse.

292
00:22:31,383 --> 00:22:34,592
Nothing will stop
the violence now, Pug.

293
00:22:35,054 --> 00:22:37,034
It's already far too late.

294
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:41,231
And if Mountbatten thinks charm
alone can do it, then he's a fool.

295
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,664
Thank you for your candour.

296
00:22:42,728 --> 00:22:46,369
- Your Excellency...
- I know hovv grave the situation is.

297
00:22:46,432 --> 00:22:49,572
I'm meeting the leaders
and all the maharajas,

298
00:22:49,635 --> 00:22:50,409
who of course have their own fears

299
00:22:50,436 --> 00:22:52,074
about what a transfer of power
will bring.

300
00:22:52,404 --> 00:22:54,281
There is a great deal to do.

301
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,115
I want to hear from all of you.

302
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:08,463
The growing conflict between Moslem
and Hindu

303
00:23:08,521 --> 00:23:11,434
has left 40,000 dead.

304
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:14,504
The new Viceroy arrives in India

305
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,666
amid scenes of terrible death
and destruction.

306
00:23:18,364 --> 00:23:20,366
It would be a disgrace

307
00:23:20,432 --> 00:23:25,279
and an everlasting slur on Britain's
standing in the world

308
00:23:25,337 --> 00:23:32,312
if we were to abandon 400 million
primitive Indians to their fate.

309
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:38,357
Do it nicely.

310
00:23:40,185 --> 00:23:43,098
You have to cut neatly.
It has to be neat.

311
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:44,634
They all have to be the same size.

312
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:48,297
This is most irregular.
The staff will not understand.

313
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:51,298
I want them to know who we are.

314
00:23:57,803 --> 00:24:00,750
Lady Mountbatten.

315
00:24:00,973 --> 00:24:03,112
Your Excellency.

316
00:24:05,244 --> 00:24:05,745
Aap door!

317
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:07,388
Get the chickens from the oven now!

318
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:12,191
Our head English chef left us rather
unexpectedly with Lord Wavell.

319
00:24:12,217 --> 00:24:15,289
We are awaiting his replacement
from England.

320
00:24:15,354 --> 00:24:21,396
Meanwhile, may I present
our acting head chef, Ram Lal Chandra,

321
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:28,073
He has been fully trained
in the finest European cuisine

322
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,740
and should meet your requirements
sufficiently.

323
00:24:31,103 --> 00:24:35,483
I do believe we can save the new
English chef the journey.

324
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:39,682

\/Ir Chandra will do
a perfectly good job.

325
00:24:40,245 --> 00:24:45,251
That wonderful dinner you served last
night put Claridges to shame.

326
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:50,229
Lady Sahib, the credit must also
go to my staff

327
00:24:50,289 --> 00:24:54,169
and my sous-chef, Jinnah Abdul Ivlalik.

328
00:24:54,627 --> 00:24:57,335
He prepares a most excellent
Lamb Wellington

329
00:24:57,396 --> 00:25:00,206
and bread and butter pudding
with the finest marmalade.

330
00:25:00,265 --> 00:25:05,078
That's all well and good, but with
your agreement, Chef Chandra,

331
00:25:05,137 --> 00:25:07,344
I'd like to make a few changes.

332
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:14,048
From now on there'

 be more Indians
of all faiths round our table.

333
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:17,083
Their culinary needs
must be waited for.

334
00:25:18,217 --> 00:25:21,289
Many of them eat with their fingers,
Your Excellency.

335
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:24,061
If that is custom, then it's perfectly
acceptable.

336
00:25:24,123 --> 00:25:28,538
Lady Sahib, many Indians are
vegetarians.

337
00:25:28,594 --> 00:25:32,064
No mutton, no chicken, no game.

338
00:25:36,302 --> 00:25:38,248
ls there something wrong?

339
00:25:38,604 --> 00:25:40,743
What he was saying...

340
00:25:41,006 --> 00:25:42,508
Your Excellency.

341
00:25:45,277 --> 00:25:49,123
It is so fine that you want
to be more inclusive.

342
00:25:49,415 --> 00:25:52,225
We have waited a
long time for this day.

343
00:25:53,185 --> 00:25:56,428
I appreciate your understanding.

344
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:57,592
And your skill.

345
00:26:00,592 --> 00:26:02,128
I need to meet with
the governors‘ wives.

346
00:26:02,194 --> 00:26:05,038
What kind of an example
are you setting, Abdul bir?

347
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:06,475
Yard.

348
00:26:06,532 --> 00:26:09,103
- Z for...?
- Zebra!

349
00:26:09,168 --> 00:26:11,273
I wish I could communicate with them.

350
00:26:11,336 --> 00:26:15,307
Why don't you try this?

351
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,151
No Viceroy or members of his family

352
00:26:23,215 --> 00:26:26,219
have ever visited the staff
compound before.

353
00:26:26,285 --> 00:26:28,595
The houses look small
for an entire family.

354
00:26:29,989 --> 00:26:31,332
Where do you live here, Aalia?

355
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:34,098
I live right there with my father.

356
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:35,297
Did you go to the school?

357
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,135
No, I grew up in Amritsar.

358
00:26:37,196 --> 00:26:38,732
I went to a ladies‘ college.

359
00:26:39,732 --> 00:26:43,202
And then events turned unfortunate.

360
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:45,441
My father lost his eyesight and...

361
00:26:45,504 --> 00:26:47,108
and now I work.

362
00:26:47,172 --> 00:26:48,480
That must be very hard.

363
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:52,044
Not at all. My work gives me
independence.

364
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:54,217
That's what my mother says.

365
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:57,283
She says she didn't know who she was
until she started working

366
00:26:57,349 --> 00:26:59,329
and really she's tireless.

367
00:26:59,384 --> 00:27:01,557
I hardly saw her during the war.
She was so busy.

368
00:27:39,224 --> 00:27:42,569
Welcome, Jeet, to my son's
engagement party.

369
00:27:42,594 --> 00:27:44,335
You know of course my son, Sanjit.

370
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:45,773
Of course. Welcome here.

371
00:27:46,031 --> 00:27:49,501
Have you met this wonderful girl
who is going to be his wife, Sunita?

372
00:27:49,568 --> 00:27:53,072
No, we have not formally met yet,
but I am delighted.

373
00:27:53,105 --> 00:27:55,608
- Congratulations to you both.
- Thank you.

374
00:27:57,443 --> 00:27:58,683
Hello, sir.

375
00:27:59,378 --> 00:28:02,450
I hope you will remember me.
I am Jeet Kumar.

376
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:06,222
Ah, Jeet Kumar.

377
00:28:06,285 --> 00:28:07,992
The little policeman.

378
00:28:09,721 --> 00:28:12,099
Barely old enough to tie his shoes.

379
00:28:12,157 --> 00:28:14,296
- Ha, ha! Yes, sir.
- Sit, sit.

380
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:17,503
It's good to meet you again,
Jeet Kumar.

381
00:28:17,563 --> 00:28:21,340
Remember, you used to read me
Dickens?

382
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,404
Yes, sir. David Copperfield,

383
00:28:24,503 --> 00:28:26,107
Bleak House.

384
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:28,072
What brings you to Delhi?

385
00:28:28,073 --> 00:28:30,451
I have great expectations.

386
00:28:33,445 --> 00:28:35,652
I am working for Mountbatten sahib.

387
00:28:39,518 --> 00:28:41,725
Aalia, I thought you'd never get here.

388
00:28:41,987 --> 00:28:43,489
I was with Lady Pamela.

389
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:46,126
- What's she like?
- Full of questions.

390
00:28:46,191 --> 00:28:48,068
She's actually interested in us.

391
00:28:48,093 --> 00:28:50,095
She wants to be involved
and improve the school.

392
00:28:50,162 --> 00:28:52,665
Aren't you married yet?

393
00:28:53,131 --> 00:28:57,546
That girl you used to talk
to me about, did she change her mind?

394
00:28:58,604 --> 00:28:59,639
No, sir...

395
00:29:01,006 --> 00:29:02,508
but I live in hope.

396
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,178
Ah.

397
00:29:04,343 --> 00:29:06,380
- Ubba.
- Ah, Aalia.

398
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:08,287
Do you remember Jeet Kumar?

399
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:10,124
Yes, Ubba.

400
00:29:10,182 --> 00:29:12,389
My daughter too is still unmarried

401
00:29:12,618 --> 00:29:16,259
but her young man, Asif,
will soon be back.

402
00:29:16,388 --> 00:29:20,097
He has been in Europe all this time,
fighting in the British army.

403
00:29:20,626 --> 00:29:23,539
As soon as he returns
we will have the wedding.

404
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:26,269
This is Aa
ia's poor mother's
dying wish.

405
00:29:27,332 --> 00:29:28,640
She chose you a good man.

406
00:29:28,967 --> 00:29:32,073
- Don't you think, Aalia?
- Yes, Ubba.

407
00:29:32,537 --> 00:29:35,143
We must go now. It's late. Come.

408
00:29:35,207 --> 00:29:38,677
Come, my friend. I'll walk you home.

409
00:29:38,744 --> 00:29:41,247
You stay, celebrate with your friend.

410
00:29:42,047 --> 00:29:45,324
- Good night, sir.
- Good night, Jeet Kumar.

411
00:29:47,152 --> 00:29:48,688
Jeet?

412
00:29:49,721 --> 00:29:52,429
That prison took away my sight.

413
00:29:53,392 --> 00:29:56,202
It could have taken
away my dignity too.

414
00:29:56,662 --> 00:29:59,370
You made sure it did not.

415
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:03,006
I'm grateful.

416
00:30:07,339 --> 00:30:11,151
I'll always be grateful
for your care for my father.

417
00:30:12,077 --> 00:30:13,715
There you are! Come on.

418
00:30:13,779 --> 00:30:16,350
Let's show them hovv we do things
in Punjab.

419
00:30:43,542 --> 00:30:45,351
What harm is in a dance?

420
00:30:48,413 --> 00:30:51,792
Oi, sala. She doesn't want to dance.

421
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:53,757
Watch what you're doing.

422
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:58,594
He wasn't doing anything. It's fine.

423
00:30:58,657 --> 00:31:01,103
You dance with your own kind.

424
00:31:01,126 --> 00:31:03,072
- My own kind?
- Calm down.

425
00:31:03,428 --> 00:31:06,409
Have some respect.

426
00:31:06,598 --> 00:31:09,238
Since when does a Ivlussalman
tell us what to do?

427
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:15,514
Come, come, come.

428
00:31:15,574 --> 00:31:17,212
Shake now.

429
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:20,222
Musicians, please...

430
00:31:53,812 --> 00:31:55,792
It's three o'clock in the morning.

431
00:31:57,215 --> 00:31:58,319
Come to bed.

432
00:31:59,184 --> 00:32:01,186
Your family tree can wait.

433
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,631
Edwina, I wasn't...

434
00:32:03,989 --> 00:32:06,162
I'm reading the governors‘ reports.

435
00:32:07,526 --> 00:32:09,267
Very unpleasant.

436
00:32:09,328 --> 00:32:11,205
I fear a migraine looms.

437
00:32:12,064 --> 00:32:15,204
- Did you take one of your pills?
- They are not working.

438
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:18,009
Nothing works. It's just...

439
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:23,586
Jenkins‘ report on
Punjab is the worst.

440
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:29,421
The more I discover here, the more...

441
00:32:30,015 --> 00:32:31,221
depressing it is.

442
00:32:31,249 --> 00:32:35,197
The real lesson of the day is that
our time frame for e><iting won't work.

443
00:32:35,253 --> 00:32:37,164
We have to act more quickly
than I thought.

444
00:32:37,355 --> 00:32:38,390
Dickie...

445
00:32:39,691 --> 00:32:40,692
this needs time.

446
00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:43,535
The longer we stay, the more we risk
further violence.

447
00:32:43,595 --> 00:32:46,269
We haven't the means or the manpower
to keep the peace.

448
00:32:46,331 --> 00:32:48,311
Don't rush.

449
00:32:49,201 --> 00:32:50,544
Seriously.

450
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:53,410
This is why you're terrible at chess.

451
00:32:57,376 --> 00:32:59,583
Pug believes that
Pakistan is inevitable.

452
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:03,490
He thinks I should meet Jinnah first
to understand why.

453
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:09,189
Nehru has offered you
a very precious thing.

454
00:33:10,155 --> 00:33:11,361
Friendship.

455
00:33:12,758 --> 00:33:14,362
Why don't you talk with him first?

456
00:33:15,126 --> 00:33:18,437
Novv, we want to find
the best possible solution.

457
00:33:18,563 --> 00:33:22,033
Congress will not contemplate
dividing our Mother India.

458
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:25,778
It would make a mockery of everything
that we have striven for

459
00:33:26,137 --> 00:33:29,084
and it would break GandhijFs heart.

460
00:33:29,107 --> 00:33:31,348
Then hovv are we to keep the peace?

461
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:34,151
You want us to quit India,
but hovv can we leave

462
00:33:34,212 --> 00:33:37,125
when you can't agree on what
your future should be?

463
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:39,788
Are you blaming us
for the situation here?

464
00:33:40,051 --> 00:33:44,295
I'm not blaming anyone, but at
all costs we must avoid a civil war.

465
00:33:44,422 --> 00:33:48,234
Forgive me, but this is the result of
British policy.

466
00:33:49,061 --> 00:33:51,200
You have done everything

467
00:33:51,263 --> 00:33:54,142
to foster hatred between
our different communities.

468
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:58,375
Separate schools,
textbooks, elections.

469
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:01,210
That was always your policy,

470
00:34:01,273 --> 00:34:04,083
divide and rule.

471
00:34:04,142 --> 00:34:08,454
So now you have divided us,
you ask me for a solution.

472
00:34:09,648 --> 00:34:11,685
"Without peace,

473
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:14,162
"all other dreams vanish

474
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:16,426
"and are reduced to ashes."

475
00:34:19,157 --> 00:34:21,034
You went on to say

476
00:34:21,093 --> 00:34:26,771
that the only alternative
to co-e><istence is co-destruction.

477
00:34:28,266 --> 00:34:32,612
But I'm really only here to ask you
to pass on a message.

478
00:34:32,671 --> 00:34:36,585
Your sister very kindly offered
to show me round Congress.

479
00:34:36,641 --> 00:34:39,781
Please, would you tell her
I'd be honoured to accept?

480
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:42,015
Gladly.

481
00:34:49,287 --> 00:34:52,530
Your wife is very well read.

482
00:34:53,225 --> 00:34:54,260
Yes.

483
00:34:54,326 --> 00:34:58,741
The irony is, of course, that she's far
more of a political animal than I am.

484
00:34:58,797 --> 00:35:02,074
She's an idealist,
tends to the left. I'm...

485
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:03,305
more of a military man.

486
00:35:04,703 --> 00:35:06,614
What are your orders here?

487
00:35:07,339 --> 00:35:12,482
To bring independence to India
as smoothly as is possible.

488
00:35:13,144 --> 00:35:15,988
But what is that India?
What Will it be?

489
00:35:16,448 --> 00:35:19,019
India is her people,

490
00:35:19,217 --> 00:35:21,697
individual men and women

491
00:35:21,753 --> 00:35:24,734
held together by indivisible threads.

492
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:27,402
Our spirit can never be beaten.

493
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:32,369
Through all the years of your empire,
it has only grown stronger.

494
00:35:32,664 --> 00:35:34,371
We belong together, in a secular...

495
00:35:36,234 --> 00:35:38,145
This is what our fathers fought for.

496
00:35:39,671 --> 00:35:42,515
I'm so happy that we're here
to witness it.

497
00:35:43,675 --> 00:35:46,713
What is the first thing
you'll do when India becomes free?

498
00:35:47,779 --> 00:35:51,750
I'm going to climb to the top of
the dome of Viceroy's House

499
00:35:52,017 --> 00:35:53,519
and scream for joy.

500
00:35:53,785 --> 00:35:55,059
And you?

501
00:35:58,123 --> 00:35:59,796
I'm going to marry you.

502
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:04,496
Hovv can that ever happen?

503
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:07,204
YOU are SO COUFGQGOUS.

504
00:36:08,567 --> 00:36:11,207
You are the bravest woman I know.

505
00:36:12,637 --> 00:36:14,548
Don't run from what is true.

506
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:20,754
What do you personally think?

507
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:28,162
To divide India would be a tragedy.

508
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:32,567
Then please, talk to Jinnah.

509
00:36:34,392 --> 00:36:36,770
This is quite a new sensation.

510
00:36:37,362 --> 00:36:38,466
What is?

511
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,669
Trusting the Viceroy.

512
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:47,106
I've spent nine years of my life
in British jails,

513
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:49,545
but I believe in
your sincerity, Dickie,

514
00:36:50,575 --> 00:36:53,283
and I believe that
you love my country.

515
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:57,683
Don't let Jinnah persuade you
to tear it in two.

516
00:37:32,984 --> 00:37:34,588
Ubba?

517
00:37:34,653 --> 00:37:36,326
I have brought someone to see you.

518
00:37:36,388 --> 00:37:39,096
Aalia, where have you been?

519
00:37:39,224 --> 00:37:42,398
Ubba, here is Jeet Kumar.

520
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:44,263
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

521
00:37:44,329 --> 00:37:46,275
We have something important
to speak...

522
00:37:46,331 --> 00:37:47,605
Later, later.

523
00:37:47,666 --> 00:37:50,237
You will never guess who is here.

524
00:37:53,705 --> 00:37:55,013
Aalia.

525
00:37:55,073 --> 00:37:56,711
- Asif?
- As-Salaam-Alaikum.

526
00:37:57,575 --> 00:37:59,577
VVa-Alaikum-Salaam.

527
00:38:02,347 --> 00:38:05,487
I was so worried that you wouldn't
recognise me.

528
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:07,461
It's been too long.

529
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:09,999
I thought the British Army
would never let us leave.

530
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:13,328
We were the last regiment
to be demobbed.

531
00:38:13,959 --> 00:38:15,996
Finally I feel the vvar is over.

532
00:38:16,061 --> 00:38:20,635
Asif, this is Jeet Kumar,
my old friend from Lahore.

533
00:38:21,466 --> 00:38:24,572
Aalia, can you believe, Asif's working
with Jinnah sahib?

534
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:26,240
Mohammad Ali Jinnah?

535
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,341
Only as his driver and aide.

536
00:38:29,441 --> 00:38:31,512
I'm aiming to serve him however I can.

537
00:38:31,576 --> 00:38:34,455
Asif, tell 
\/Ir Jinnah,

538
00:38:34,512 --> 00:38:37,049
many Muslims also fought for India.

539
00:38:37,082 --> 00:38:39,153
We don't want a separate country.

540
00:38:39,217 --> 00:38:44,496
- Jinnah sahib is a visionary, sir.
- He is a troublemaker.

541
00:38:44,556 --> 00:38:46,763
He's the only one
speaking for us.

542
00:38:57,368 --> 00:39:00,042
- 
\/Ir Jinnah...
- 
\/Ir Jinnah...

543
00:39:00,104 --> 00:39:02,550
Spokesman for a large group of
India's Ivlohammedans

544
00:39:02,607 --> 00:39:07,022
is the leader of the All-India Muslim
League, Muhammad Ali Jinnah.

545
00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:09,456
In direct conflict with the Congress
party's request

546
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:11,050
for national independence...

547
00:39:11,082 --> 00:39:13,255
Pakistan Zindabad!

548
00:39:13,318 --> 00:39:17,095
he has demanded that Britain create
a separate and independent state

549
00:39:17,155 --> 00:39:21,069
out of those provinces in which
Muslims predominate.

550
00:39:22,727 --> 00:39:24,468
We are also looking
to the future.

551
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:28,341
I learned this when I visited
the ancient spires of Cambridge.

552
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:31,744
Oh, yes, a haven for historians.

553
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:34,211
Cambridge also creates visionaries.

554
00:39:34,272 --> 00:39:36,183
Such as your old friend 
\/Ir Nehru.

555
00:39:36,241 --> 00:39:41,088
A little after 
\/Ir Nehru's time,
in 1933, a group of Cambridge students

556
00:39:41,112 --> 00:39:45,322
came up with a truly magnificent
original idea.

557
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:46,987
And what was that?

558
00:39:47,052 --> 00:39:48,497
Pakistan.

559
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:51,124
The land of the pure.

560
00:39:52,157 --> 00:39:53,534
Muslims do not want to be reduced

561
00:39:53,591 --> 00:39:56,697
to the unequal position of negroes
in America.

562
00:39:56,761 --> 00:40:00,208
I assure you Muslims would never be
treated as second-class citizens.

563
00:40:00,265 --> 00:40:03,269
But we are a minority of one to four.
Hovv can you guarantee that?

564
00:40:03,334 --> 00:40:05,336
If you engage with the other leaders,

565
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:09,078
constitutional protection for
Muslim citizens can be secured.

566
00:40:09,107 --> 00:40:13,055
It is the other leaders who refuse
to engage with me.

567
00:40:14,312 --> 00:40:16,656
I already have the solution.

568
00:40:16,714 --> 00:40:20,287
The creation of an Islamic country,
Pakistan.

569
00:40:27,292 --> 00:40:31,331
Could you really
see India cut in half?

570
00:40:31,629 --> 00:40:35,577
Sometimes surgery can save
the patient.

571
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:39,681
Where do you propose
to make the incision?

572
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:43,142
Pakistan will include all the states
that have a Muslim majority.

573
00:40:43,174 --> 00:40:46,121
But what about those states
where the numbers are equal?

574
00:40:46,177 --> 00:40:48,214
The Punjab, Bengal,
what do we do there?

575
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:50,555
Include them in Pakistan.

576
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:54,825
The ideals of Islam have taught us
democracy and justice.

577
00:40:55,053 --> 00:40:58,193
Our Hindu and Sikh citizens will be
able to worship

578
00:40:58,256 --> 00:41:00,236
and to vote as they please,

579
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:03,333
but we Muslims will be protected.

580
00:41:03,394 --> 00:41:05,465
We will be in a majority.

581
00:41:06,331 --> 00:41:08,743
Perhaps there was a time when
I believed

582
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,140
our interests could be secured
within a united India,

583
00:41:13,037 --> 00:41:15,142
but that was long ago.

584
00:41:16,341 --> 00:41:20,221
Nehru and Gandhi have shown
no respect for me or my views,

585
00:41:20,278 --> 00:41:23,418
so hovv can I trust them to respect
the views of my fellow Muslims?

586
00:41:26,117 --> 00:41:29,291
Look at this branch of my family tree.

587
00:41:29,454 --> 00:41:32,298
See hovv it withers with
no new shoots.

588
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:34,629
That's my Uncle Nicholas.

589
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:37,037
He was Tsar of Russia.

590
00:41:37,128 --> 00:41:42,339
He and his entire family and staff
bayoneted, set on fire,

591
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,279
in order to create someones utopia.

592
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:47,612
New nations are rarely born in peace.

593
00:41:47,672 --> 00:41:52,382
But to yoke Hindus and Muslims
together in one unequal state

594
00:41:52,443 --> 00:41:55,447
is a recipe for the very bloodshed
you want to avoid.

595
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:56,787
United...

596
00:41:58,049 --> 00:42:01,121
you are one fifth of
the world's population.

597
00:42:01,486 --> 00:42:05,161
India would be the greatest power
in all Asia.

598
00:42:05,323 --> 00:42:07,701
India has never been a true nation.

599
00:42:08,126 --> 00:42:10,106
It only looks that way on a map.

600
00:42:10,495 --> 00:42:14,102
The British divided Ireland
to maintain peace.

601
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:17,179
They are dividing Palestine.

602
00:42:18,036 --> 00:42:20,380
They must do the same here.

603
00:42:20,438 --> 00:42:22,384
I have heard with my own ears.

604
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:25,649
Jinnah sahib said he will cut India
in half.

605
00:42:26,778 --> 00:42:28,587
- He will give us Pakistan.
- Yes.

606
00:42:28,646 --> 00:42:30,626
No, no, no, no, no.
That cannot happen.

607
00:42:30,682 --> 00:42:34,186
- Why can't it happen?
- Gandhiji said over his dead body.

608
00:42:34,252 --> 00:42:35,629
He would not lie.

609
00:42:36,487 --> 00:42:38,296
Pakistan Zindabad.

610
00:42:38,356 --> 00:42:42,566
- Pakistan Zindabad.
- Stop! Stop!

611
00:42:42,627 --> 00:42:45,403
Stop, brothers!

612
00:42:45,463 --> 00:42:47,465
Stop, brothers! Stop!

613
00:42:48,132 --> 00:42:51,545
The British have controlled India
this past 300 years

614
00:42:51,602 --> 00:42:54,412
by making sure we fight amongst
ourselves just like this.

615
00:42:54,472 --> 00:42:55,177
Guptaji...

616
00:42:55,206 --> 00:42:58,153
No, Ivlohsin, do not allow this poison
to enter our thoughts.

617
00:42:58,209 --> 00:42:59,620
- Guptaji, Pakistan...
- Gentlemen!

618
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,720
Whatever is going on
in those rooms upstairs

619
00:43:04,983 --> 00:43:06,553
is none of your business.

620
00:43:06,618 --> 00:43:08,495
It's 5.45.

621
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:11,261
Dinner is now running late.

622
00:43:11,456 --> 00:43:13,595
All of you, jaldi, jaldi.

623
00:43:21,299 --> 00:43:23,711
Your family are from the Punjab,
aren't they?

624
00:43:23,768 --> 00:43:25,748
Yes, sir, they are.

625
00:43:26,104 --> 00:43:30,519
In my village, I have five sisters,
Thirteen nieces and nine nephews.

626
00:43:30,575 --> 00:43:33,146
Duleep Singh, sir, his family
are our neighbours.

627
00:43:33,411 --> 00:43:35,357
Do you have Muslim neighbours too?

628
00:43:35,513 --> 00:43:36,787
Of course, sir.

629
00:43:37,115 --> 00:43:39,026
All the children play together.

630
00:43:39,417 --> 00:43:42,626
They celebrate Diwali with us,
we celebrate Eid with them.

631
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:45,559
Sometimes there is even
marriage between us.

632
00:43:49,694 --> 00:43:51,139
Are you married?

633
00:43:51,162 --> 00:43:52,266
No, sir.

634
00:43:53,398 --> 00:43:55,571
I do not know if it is in my destiny.

635
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:57,340
My mother dreams of it.

636
00:43:57,402 --> 00:43:58,608
And your father?

637
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:05,343
He died, sir.

638
00:44:08,713 --> 00:44:10,192
When I was a child.

639
00:44:11,115 --> 00:44:15,086
Killed by the British at
the Jallianvvala Bagh massacre.

640
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,348
Namaste, Bapuji,

641
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:44,683
It is a great honour
to meet you, Bapu.

642
00:44:57,028 --> 00:45:00,601
- This way, sir.
- Over here, please, sir.

643
00:45:08,406 --> 00:45:12,445
We Indians have
always marched, campaigned

644
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:17,152
and fasted together,
regardless of our creed or class.

645
00:45:17,215 --> 00:45:22,563
For so long we have been united
in our opposition to one oppressor.

646
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:24,361
And now we are leaving.

647
00:45:26,224 --> 00:45:31,367
It seems freedom, although
longed for... is a fearful thing.

648
00:45:31,429 --> 00:45:35,070
And with fear comes violence.
It's contagious.

649
00:45:36,534 --> 00:45:39,481
But courage is even more contagious.

650
00:45:44,642 --> 00:45:47,418
Shall I tell you what the solution is?

651
00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:56,093
Jinnah should be asked
to form the first government.

652
00:45:57,622 --> 00:45:59,124
Of independent India?

653
00:46:03,961 --> 00:46:10,606
Congress must be prepared to accept
the leadership of the Muslim League

654
00:46:10,668 --> 00:46:13,979
if, by so doing, they ensure
the unity of our country.

655
00:46:14,038 --> 00:46:18,453
You would give the Muslims the baby
rather than carving it up?

656
00:46:18,976 --> 00:46:20,080
But that's...

657
00:46:22,313 --> 00:46:24,020
That's splendidly bold.

658
00:46:24,081 --> 00:46:27,028
Would Congress ever be induced
to accept it?

659
00:46:27,084 --> 00:46:28,085
Would Jinnah?

660
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:31,087
We must rekindle the lamp
of neighbourliness

661
00:46:31,088 --> 00:46:35,332
between Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs.

662
00:46:35,526 --> 00:46:38,268
You give me hope that reason
will prevail.

663
00:46:38,329 --> 00:46:41,173
What we need is not reason.

664
00:46:42,033 --> 00:46:44,707
We need a far greater force.

665
00:46:46,137 --> 00:46:50,449
A force that politicians
seldom care to mention.

666
00:46:51,075 --> 00:46:52,349
Love?

667
00:46:52,677 --> 00:46:54,156
Precisely.

668
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:59,325
I hope you will honour me
with sharing my food.

669
00:46:59,383 --> 00:47:00,293
This is goat's curd, my favourite.

670
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:01,022
- Is it?
- You must try this.

671
00:47:01,052 --> 00:47:02,292
- No...
- I insist.

672
00:47:02,353 --> 00:47:04,094
May I have a spoon, please?

673
00:47:04,155 --> 00:47:07,159
You must try this.
This is not cow's milk.

674
00:47:07,191 --> 00:47:08,534
Wish me luck.

675
00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:14,073
Delicious, isn't it?

676
00:47:16,033 --> 00:47:18,070
Would you like to try yourself?

677
00:47:20,605 --> 00:47:23,381
I think it's what you'd call
an acquired taste...

678
00:47:28,412 --> 00:47:30,619
Did you tell Asif
it was too late for him?

679
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:33,093
Hovv could l?

680
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:37,628
It's the truth.

681
00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:41,566
My father has lost everything.

682
00:47:42,226 --> 00:47:44,502
His wife, his sight.

683
00:47:47,298 --> 00:47:49,244
He's a proud man,

684
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:51,780
unable to work, dependent on me.

685
00:47:54,105 --> 00:47:59,077
Before Asif arrived, I'd forgotten what
it was like to see him really smile.

686
00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:01,454
I have always made your father smile.

687
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:03,386
And you too.

688
00:48:03,447 --> 00:48:06,360
Aalia? Are you all right?

689
00:48:07,018 --> 00:48:08,156
Yes, ma'am.

690
00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:23,742
The Viceroy certainly knows
hovv to throw a party.

691
00:48:24,001 --> 00:48:25,071
Your Excellency.

692
00:48:25,102 --> 00:48:26,376

\/Ir Jinnah, welcome.

693
00:48:26,437 --> 00:48:30,010
May I present 
\/Ir Henry F Grady,
the American ambassador.

694
00:48:30,074 --> 00:48:31,212
Your E><ce

encies.

695
00:48:31,309 --> 00:48:32,583
Welcome, 
\/Ir Ambassador.

696
00:48:32,677 --> 00:48:38,025
Ambassador to one country or to tvvo?
The world can't wait to find out.

697
00:48:38,149 --> 00:48:40,629
The answer may be in the hands
of 
\/Ir Jinnah.

698
00:48:41,152 --> 00:48:45,100
It must feel pretty galling for you
to be giving all of this back.

699
00:48:45,389 --> 00:48:46,459
Not at all.

700
00:48:46,657 --> 00:48:48,466
Well, it is high time.

701
00:48:48,526 --> 00:48:49,470
Aalia. ..

702
00:48:50,561 --> 00:48:52,507
imagine life in Pakistan.

703
00:48:52,696 --> 00:48:55,199
No prejudice, no tension.

704
00:48:55,433 --> 00:48:57,470
It's a nation our children
will be proud of.

705
00:48:57,535 --> 00:48:59,344
We were born in India.

706
00:49:00,304 --> 00:49:03,308
And our parents and all our ancestors
are buried here.

707
00:49:03,374 --> 00:49:05,684
- Hovv can we leave?
- We'll visit.

708
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:08,389
l'll drive my lovely wife
in l\/lr Jinnah's car.

709
00:49:10,014 --> 00:49:12,085
Why should we not be happy?

710
00:49:14,252 --> 00:49:18,667
We've both come through hard years
and I've kept you with me, always.

711
00:49:28,599 --> 00:49:30,101
I'm just a schoolgirl here.

712
00:49:31,202 --> 00:49:32,681
And I was just a boy.

713
00:49:35,406 --> 00:49:36,544
But I knew.

714
00:49:39,577 --> 00:49:40,453
Asif.

715
00:49:43,147 --> 00:49:45,252
I am not that girl any more.

716
00:49:49,153 --> 00:49:51,724
I understand this distance
you're keeping.

717
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:55,734
You must have felt I abandoned you.

718
00:49:58,562 --> 00:50:00,337
But I am here now.

719
00:50:01,032 --> 00:50:02,238
Please...

720
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:05,207
Give me a chance.

721
00:50:05,269 --> 00:50:07,180
I'll prove I can look after you.

722
00:50:12,743 --> 00:50:15,189
Miss Jinnah, I've been longing
to meet you.

723
00:50:15,246 --> 00:50:16,020
And I you.

724
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:19,493
Your Excellency... a word.

725
00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:21,052
Please e><cuse me.

726
00:50:22,386 --> 00:50:24,127
Just one moment.

727
00:50:26,157 --> 00:50:28,262
That is not a conversation
I should leave.

728
00:50:28,325 --> 00:50:29,360
This better be good, Pug.

729
00:50:29,427 --> 00:50:31,373
Anything but good.

730
00:50:31,662 --> 00:50:33,699
There's been a massacre in Punjab.

731
00:50:34,131 --> 00:50:36,042
Half of Rawalpindi is on fire.

732
00:50:36,133 --> 00:50:38,477
Muslims burned down
Sikh and Hindu houses.

733
00:50:38,569 --> 00:50:42,142
Brutal reprisals have spread
through Muslim streets.

734
00:50:42,173 --> 00:50:44,244
Order the Punjab police out in force.

735
00:50:44,308 --> 00:50:46,618
- We have.
- If this is replicated...

736
00:50:46,677 --> 00:50:49,783
With respect, there are
18,000 towns like this in Punjab.

737
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:51,549
We don't have the men.

738
00:50:51,615 --> 00:50:52,753
Then call in the Army.

739
00:50:52,816 --> 00:50:56,127
There are barely any
English soldiers left.

740
00:50:56,153 --> 00:50:58,463
The Indians have divided loyalties.

741
00:50:58,522 --> 00:51:03,164
Hovv can we ask Sikhs to fire on
Sikhs, Muslims on Muslims?

742
00:51:03,227 --> 00:51:06,674
I'm telling you, Dickie,
India is a ship on fire.

743
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:07,674
Daddy, guess what?

744
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:10,041
- A telegram has come...
- Pamela, do not interrupt!

745
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:12,046
- From the King.
- Get them round the table.

746
00:51:12,103 --> 00:51:13,776
All the leaders.

747
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:17,344
Pammy!

748
00:51:18,743 --> 00:51:20,313
I'm sorry.

749
00:51:20,377 --> 00:51:22,152
Please tell me what it is.

750
00:51:23,514 --> 00:51:26,256
Princess Lilibet is going to marry
Philip.

751
00:51:27,151 --> 00:51:28,687
But that's wonderful.

752
00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:30,658
They want me for a bridesmaid.

753
00:51:30,721 --> 00:51:32,758
That's splendid, Pammy.

754
00:51:34,358 --> 00:51:38,067
Come on, now. Let's not have this.
Can't let the side down, not in public.

755
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:48,640
Following the bad news
of communal fighting in India,

756
00:51:48,706 --> 00:51:52,085
with his wife and daughter, the
Viceroy has been paying a visit

757
00:51:52,142 --> 00:51:54,554
to the north-west frontier and Punjab.

758
00:51:55,212 --> 00:51:58,056
He visited many of the places where
the worst clashes had occurred

759
00:51:58,082 --> 00:52:01,359
and saw for himself the serious e><tent
of the rioting

760
00:52:01,385 --> 00:52:03,422
and the vast amount of damage done.

761
00:52:44,461 --> 00:52:47,635
Let Jinnah be Prime Minister
of independent India.

762
00:52:47,698 --> 00:52:50,144
Bapuji, it won't work.

763
00:52:51,202 --> 00:52:52,146
Why not?

764
00:52:52,303 --> 00:52:56,479
With the best will in the world,
Jinnah will never agree.

765
00:52:56,607 --> 00:52:59,178
He wouldn't even come to this table.

766
00:52:59,276 --> 00:53:01,984
He said the time for talking is over.

767
00:53:02,046 --> 00:53:04,356
I think it's a very daring idea.

768
00:53:04,982 --> 00:53:07,588
Daring, yes, but feasible?

769
00:53:07,751 --> 00:53:09,560
Jinnah's not a fool, Dickie.

770
00:53:09,753 --> 00:53:12,996
He knows that you can't place
300 million Hindus

771
00:53:13,524 --> 00:53:16,471
under the rule of the Muslim League.
They won't have it.

772
00:53:16,527 --> 00:53:19,098
But if you leaders give him
your support?

773
00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:21,039
This is a democracy.

774
00:53:21,132 --> 00:53:24,375
At the first opportunity,
the people will vote him out.

775
00:53:24,401 --> 00:53:27,245
Which brings us back to square one:

776
00:53:27,504 --> 00:53:31,042
- The Muslim minority and Pakistan.
- I agree.

777
00:53:31,108 --> 00:53:35,215
Why do you all not see,
if we oppose partition,

778
00:53:35,412 --> 00:53:37,585
India remains united.

779
00:53:37,715 --> 00:53:41,128
Hovv many towns
descending into slaughter?

780
00:53:41,452 --> 00:53:44,433
We've tried too long to break
this deadlock.

781
00:53:44,722 --> 00:53:46,702
Singh, Kumar.

782
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:57,610
The world moves on.

783
00:53:58,135 --> 00:54:00,615
Not as we like it, but it moves.

784
00:54:00,771 --> 00:54:02,478
We will have our independence.

785
00:54:02,973 --> 00:54:04,714
Let Jinnah have his Pakistan.

786
00:54:05,409 --> 00:54:07,719
In five years‘ time,
he will be knocking at our door

787
00:54:07,978 --> 00:54:10,356
and begging to be part of India again.

788
00:54:10,414 --> 00:54:15,386
It is not possible to divide the heart
and e><pect it to work.

789
00:54:15,452 --> 00:54:17,659
Gandhiji, hovv can we reach
an agreement with Jinnah

790
00:54:17,721 --> 00:54:20,292
if you can't agree with Jawahar?

791
00:54:20,424 --> 00:54:22,700
Every moment we debate
brings more violence.

792
00:54:23,627 --> 00:54:28,098
We can concede the provinces
with a clear Muslim majority,

793
00:54:28,432 --> 00:54:31,436
but Jinnah cannot have Punjab
and Bengal.

794
00:54:31,702 --> 00:54:34,774
They have large Hindu and
Sikh populations.

795
00:54:35,305 --> 00:54:39,754
Then we must divide the two provinces
between the two countries.

796
00:54:40,578 --> 00:54:45,152
Half of the Punjab and
Bengal to India,

797
00:54:45,449 --> 00:54:47,725
the other half to Pakistan.

798
00:54:48,318 --> 00:54:49,592
Partition.

799
00:54:50,254 --> 00:54:55,294
And which god among you
decides where the border falls?

800
00:55:10,541 --> 00:55:14,421
You've spoken yourself about
the beauty of compromise.

801
00:55:17,047 --> 00:55:19,618
This compromise will have
beauty, Bapu...

802
00:55:20,617 --> 00:55:22,494
because it will bring peace.

803
00:55:23,554 --> 00:55:26,398
The callouses on my feet,

804
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:29,197
the years in prison...

805
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:33,505
the hopes and dreams of our people

806
00:55:33,697 --> 00:55:36,405
were for independence,

807
00:55:37,034 --> 00:55:38,342
not partition.

808
00:55:39,103 --> 00:55:41,379
No one is listening to Gandhiji.

809
00:55:41,438 --> 00:55:44,385
Mountbatten sahib and Nehru
seem to agree.

810
00:55:44,441 --> 00:55:47,081
Pakistan will come to be.

811
00:55:47,111 --> 00:55:48,715
Ah, Allah be praised.

812
00:55:48,779 --> 00:55:51,589
- Pakistan Zindabad.
- Our Pakistan.

813
00:55:51,648 --> 00:55:55,027
lvlohsin, our sisters are all in hiding
because of you animals.

814
00:55:55,085 --> 00:55:56,792
You're the animals,
destroying the peace.

815
00:55:57,054 --> 00:55:59,398
All religions are true.

816
00:55:59,757 --> 00:56:02,499
We are brothers with one soul.

817
00:56:04,028 --> 00:56:06,668
To divide us on religious grounds...

818
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:09,677
is against the will of God.

819
00:56:11,101 --> 00:56:14,275
Division does not create peace.

820
00:56:15,672 --> 00:56:17,652
It creates havoc.

821
00:56:18,242 --> 00:56:21,621
Partition unleashes passions.

822
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:24,423
It does not dampen them.

823
00:56:25,482 --> 00:56:27,553
We shall tear ourselves asunder

824
00:56:27,618 --> 00:56:30,531
in the womb of the mother
who bears us.

825
00:56:30,587 --> 00:56:33,090
The Viceroy's house is not
for the likes of this.

826
00:56:33,524 --> 00:56:36,095
You are dismissed, both of you.

827
00:56:43,133 --> 00:56:45,579
- Ivlohsin, no.
- Mohsin.

828
00:56:45,636 --> 00:56:46,239
What are you doing?

829
00:56:46,503 --> 00:56:48,141
Get your things.

830
00:56:48,405 --> 00:56:50,578
The guards will escort you
from your quarters.

831
00:56:51,008 --> 00:56:52,146
We are guards.

832
00:56:52,175 --> 00:56:55,054
Us leave? It is you who have
no place here.

833
00:56:55,112 --> 00:56:57,319
One more word,
I'll have you both arrested.

834
00:57:00,317 --> 00:57:04,288
Get them out of here!
Back to work!

835
00:57:05,022 --> 00:57:07,161
Come, let's go, please.

836
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:09,362
Come on!

837
00:57:18,168 --> 00:57:20,478
It's worse than Glasgow
on a Saturday night.

838
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:23,209
Thank you, my friend.

839
00:57:26,009 --> 00:57:26,714
Thank you.

840
00:57:30,547 --> 00:57:34,120
What happened with Ewart and
the staff? You were there, were you?

841
00:57:34,351 --> 00:57:36,729
Yes, sir. It was terrible.

842
00:57:36,754 --> 00:57:38,290
I've just seen Pug.

843
00:57:38,622 --> 00:57:40,192
You're going to London with him?

844
00:57:41,625 --> 00:57:44,435
We have to make the best possible
case to the government,

845
00:57:44,494 --> 00:57:48,442
get it to endorse partition and shock
the leaders out of their intransigence

846
00:57:48,499 --> 00:57:49,739
by accelerating the process.

847
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,673
Otherwise the bloodshed will
continue.

848
00:57:52,002 --> 00:57:55,245
So when were you intending to tell me
you'd made your decision on partition?

849
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:56,648
It's the only way forward.

850
00:57:56,740 --> 00:57:58,617
We've barely been here two months.

851
00:57:58,675 --> 00:58:00,279
And the country is burning.

852
00:58:00,344 --> 00:58:02,551
Dickie, there's no going back
on this decision.

853
00:58:02,613 --> 00:58:06,151
There is no time for indecision.
I must act.

854
00:58:06,216 --> 00:58:10,687
You cannot change tack so hastily.
You are a statesman, not a sailor.

855
00:58:10,954 --> 00:58:13,059
Edwina, people are dying every day!

856
00:58:13,090 --> 00:58:15,161
Murders, rapes, reprisals,

857
00:58:15,192 --> 00:58:17,331
from Calcutta to Bombay,
Amritsar to Kahuta.

858
00:58:17,394 --> 00:58:20,739
Imagine that repeated in every city
and village across India.

859
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:23,500
Hovv much longer
do you want me to wait?

860
00:58:26,169 --> 00:58:28,445
Hovv can it be getting worse
under us?

861
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:30,280
Precisely my point.

862
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:32,244
We have no control.

863
00:58:32,442 --> 00:58:35,013
But a solution is in sight.

864
00:58:35,045 --> 00:58:36,581
But partition?

865
00:58:38,081 --> 00:58:41,221
It may seem a good solution now,
but in the long term...

866
00:58:41,284 --> 00:58:44,060
It's hard enough negotiating
with them, Edwina.

867
00:58:50,661 --> 00:58:52,368
You have my support.

868
00:58:52,429 --> 00:58:54,705
But not your approval.

869
00:58:54,765 --> 00:58:56,108
You don't need my approval.

870
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:00,174
I have to persuade the prime minister,
Churchill, and the opposition.

871
00:59:00,237 --> 00:59:02,239
Heaven help me if I can't
persuade you.

872
00:59:04,007 --> 00:59:06,453
We came to give India back
her freedom.

873
00:59:07,644 --> 00:59:09,590
Not to tear her apart.

874
00:59:10,013 --> 00:59:11,492
We have no choice.

875
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:15,655
If we don't transfer power soon,
there may be nothing left to transfer.

876
00:59:23,593 --> 00:59:27,700
The Viceroy arrives in Britain by air,
having returned for consultations

877
00:59:27,998 --> 00:59:31,070
of the utmost importance regarding
the British withdrawal from India.

878
00:59:32,002 --> 00:59:35,449
He can only hope that the Viceroy will
find a solution.

879
00:59:35,506 --> 00:59:38,282
With communal fighting increasing in
violence, especially in the Punjab,

880
00:59:38,341 --> 00:59:42,221
the task of handing over is obviously
a tremendous problem.

881
00:59:42,479 --> 00:59:46,723
Curfews have been imposed
in Lahore and Calcutta,

882
00:59:47,150 --> 00:59:52,122
and large areas of Bengal
and the Punjab remain unsafe.

883
00:59:53,090 --> 00:59:58,563
Rawalpindi and its surrounding
villages are in a critical state.

884
00:59:59,529 --> 01:00:03,705
We know that some of you
have families in these areas.

885
01:00:04,668 --> 01:00:06,648
They may come to you here.

886
01:00:06,703 --> 01:00:08,341
Come on go inside.

887
01:00:08,638 --> 01:00:11,312
Basic accommodation
will be found

888
01:00:11,375 --> 01:00:14,720
and food will be rationed
to meet demand.

889
01:00:14,778 --> 01:00:17,452
A hardship fund has been
made available.

890
01:00:24,721 --> 01:00:27,292
- Pamela?
- I'm here, Aalia.

891
01:00:27,491 --> 01:00:29,266
This child has a very high fever.

892
01:00:30,594 --> 01:00:32,631
Yes, he's dehydrated.

893
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:41,411
In certain cases,
permission will be given

894
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:44,452
for you to go and bring
your people back.

895
01:00:44,508 --> 01:00:46,181
I need to get back to our village.

896
01:00:46,476 --> 01:00:49,787
The refugees have told me terrible
things. I need to get home.

897
01:00:50,514 --> 01:00:51,390
Wait.

898
01:00:53,049 --> 01:00:54,824
The violence is caused by uncertainty.

899
01:00:55,085 --> 01:00:57,292
If the British do
what Mountbatten says,

900
01:00:58,221 --> 01:01:00,167
he says the violence will stop.

901
01:01:00,190 --> 01:01:01,430
And you believe him?

902
01:01:02,759 --> 01:01:04,500
What country will our village be in?

903
01:01:05,128 --> 01:01:06,698
What if it's Pakistan?

904
01:01:07,097 --> 01:01:11,102
There is a madness taking hold here,
a hatred.

905
01:01:11,134 --> 01:01:13,080
It's soldiers deserting the army,

906
01:01:13,103 --> 01:01:16,346
men from other towns
forming into gangs and militias.

907
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:18,519
They want our land.

908
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:24,150
- Well, then, I must go with you.
- No.

909
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:26,592
I need you to stay here.

910
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:29,087
What if they've left already?

911
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:33,363
What if they arrive here
and we are gone? You stay, I'll go.

912
01:01:53,476 --> 01:01:54,614
Have you seen this, sir?

913
01:02:23,106 --> 01:02:25,609
- Ah.
- Welcome home, Daddy.

914
01:02:25,709 --> 01:02:27,416
Thank you, darling.

915
01:02:27,511 --> 01:02:30,151
- Hovv was Westminster?
- Deliciously cool.

916
01:02:30,213 --> 01:02:32,386
The cabinet passed the plan
in the blink of an eye.

917
01:02:32,449 --> 01:02:35,328
We got the green light
to speed up independence.

918
01:02:35,552 --> 01:02:36,587
What about Churchill?

919
01:02:36,653 --> 01:02:39,657
He was quite sanguine.
Accepted the plan.

920
01:02:39,723 --> 01:02:41,225
He was very complimentary.

921
01:02:41,291 --> 01:02:44,795
He pointed out that Dickie has,
in a matter of weeks,

922
01:02:45,061 --> 01:02:47,564
achieved what Wavell and
all the previous Viceroys

923
01:02:47,631 --> 01:02:50,441
failed to achieve in years.

924
01:02:51,401 --> 01:02:57,113
The government and the press
are calling it the Mountbatten Plan.

925
01:02:57,807 --> 01:02:59,650
Well done.

926
01:03:03,013 --> 01:03:05,118
The Mountbatten Plan?

927
01:03:07,017 --> 01:03:09,520

\/Ir Jinnah, what is your solution
to end the violence?

928
01:03:09,552 --> 01:03:12,692
- ls partition the only way?
- ls Pakistan the answer?

929
01:03:12,989 --> 01:03:15,993

\/Ir Jinnah, what will you be doing
to stop the escalating violence?

930
01:03:16,059 --> 01:03:18,005

\/Ir Nehru, a moment, please.

931
01:03:18,061 --> 01:03:21,042

\/Ir Nehru, do you have the support
of the Indian National Congress?

932
01:03:21,097 --> 01:03:25,045
What is your answer for freedom
in India, please, 
\/Ir Nehru?

933
01:03:30,006 --> 01:03:32,680
Now... Why has Gandhi not attended?

934
01:03:33,376 --> 01:03:37,688
He apologises but he cannot assent
to the Mountbatten Plan.

935
01:03:38,148 --> 01:03:39,422
But will he go against it?

936
01:03:39,482 --> 01:03:43,055
- Will he try to speak out, to sabotage...
- Bapuji has informed me

937
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:46,066
that today is his day of silence.

938
01:03:48,224 --> 01:03:50,602
Why must everything now be rushed?

939
01:03:51,461 --> 01:03:54,374
I wanted all of the Punjab and Bengal.

940
01:03:54,531 --> 01:03:58,570
You e><pect me to accept
a moth-eaten Pakistan?

941
01:03:58,802 --> 01:04:00,577
You should be grateful.

942
01:04:01,404 --> 01:04:03,315
You've held us to ransom
for long enough.

943
01:04:03,373 --> 01:04:06,183
- 
\/Ir Nehru, it is you...
- I am chairing this meeting

944
01:04:06,243 --> 01:04:09,383
and I demand that we respect
one another.

945
01:04:09,446 --> 01:04:13,155
The British cabinet has formally
approved the partition of India.

946
01:04:13,216 --> 01:04:15,321
By the end of this meeting,
it is my intention

947
01:04:15,385 --> 01:04:19,527
that all parties will accept the plan
and our new timeline.

948
01:04:19,589 --> 01:04:20,533
Impossible.

949
01:04:21,992 --> 01:04:22,629
We'll need a week at least

950
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:25,036
to get formal approval from
the Muslim League.

951
01:04:25,095 --> 01:04:26,597
I can't hold this position for a week.

952
01:04:27,497 --> 01:04:29,033
You've got your Pakistan,

953
01:04:29,099 --> 01:04:31,170
which at one time no one in the world
thought you'd get.

954
01:04:33,170 --> 01:04:37,141
If I don't have your agreement,
this plan will collapse,

955
01:04:38,008 --> 01:04:42,184
and the country that you have conjured
out of thin air will disappear.

956
01:04:45,682 --> 01:04:47,093
What about the borders?

957
01:04:48,151 --> 01:04:50,028
Who decides?

958
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:54,068
And where e><act
y is this Pakistan
we are signing for?

959
01:04:54,090 --> 01:04:57,628
The cabinet has appointed
Sir Cyril Radcliffe, a barrister,

960
01:04:57,694 --> 01:04:59,139
to chair the border commission.

961
01:04:59,196 --> 01:05:02,075
He will be assisted by members of
the Muslim League and by Congress.

962
01:05:02,098 --> 01:05:04,100
It will be a wholly impartial process.

963
01:05:16,146 --> 01:05:19,616
They say, don't they, that tea is
actually cooling in the hot weather?

964
01:05:21,050 --> 01:05:25,123
- Would you like it cool, sir?
- No, no. No, thank you.

965
01:05:31,061 --> 01:05:34,008
- Sir Cyril, welcome.
- Your Excellency.

966
01:05:34,064 --> 01:05:35,042
Good to see you.

967
01:05:35,065 --> 01:05:37,568
- You know Lord lsmay.
- Everyone knows Pug, sir.

968
01:05:37,634 --> 01:05:40,080
You've come in the hottest summer
for 75 years,

969
01:05:40,103 --> 01:05:41,411
114 degrees in the shade.

970
01:05:41,471 --> 01:05:44,509
- I'll adjust, I'm sure.
- You don't mind if I...

971
01:05:44,574 --> 01:05:47,077
Novv, At
ee's told you of the task.

972
01:05:47,210 --> 01:05:50,089
Yes, you want a fair decision
on a boundary line

973
01:05:50,146 --> 01:05:53,457
dividing 9O million Muslims, Sikhs
and Hindus.

974
01:05:53,550 --> 01:05:55,393
Quite so.
Tea with milk.

975
01:05:55,452 --> 01:05:57,432
And you want it by August 15th.

976
01:05:57,587 --> 01:05:59,294
Actually, that's one day shy.

977
01:05:59,356 --> 01:06:02,667
I've agreed to move the date up to
midnight of August 14th

978
01:06:02,725 --> 01:06:04,204
to satisfy the astrologers.

979
01:06:04,461 --> 01:06:06,270
That's less than five weeks.

980
01:06:06,329 --> 01:06:08,309
You'll have a small team working
with you.

981
01:06:08,365 --> 01:06:11,346
They'll be representing
all the parties concerned.

982
01:06:11,401 --> 01:06:17,079
We'll provide you with maps,
census figures, geographical data,

983
01:06:17,107 --> 01:06:20,384
and any other information you require.

984
01:06:21,544 --> 01:06:26,050
You're asking me to draw a line
through people's houses,

985
01:06:26,282 --> 01:06:29,024
rice paddies, jute fields...

986
01:06:29,085 --> 01:06:33,158
Look, I understand.
It's a daunting proposition, yes.

987
01:06:33,490 --> 01:06:38,735
And we all accept that some anomalies
will be inevitable.

988
01:06:39,329 --> 01:06:42,173
Radcliffe, hovv well do you know
Bengal and the Punjab?

989
01:06:42,232 --> 01:06:44,405
I assumed Pug would have
told you, sir.

990
01:06:44,467 --> 01:06:47,346
I've never set foot
in India in my life.

991
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:53,510
What I don't understand is 15 August.

992
01:06:53,576 --> 01:06:55,146
That's just a few weeks away.

993
01:06:55,212 --> 01:06:58,750
Why so soon, huh? They were
supposed to leave ne><t year.

994
01:06:59,015 --> 01:07:01,291
They don't want to be accountable
for the carnage.

995
01:07:01,351 --> 01:07:04,059
Mountbatten sahib is trying
to prevent carnage.

996
01:07:04,454 --> 01:07:05,694
That is why he moved the date.

997
01:07:06,222 --> 01:07:08,702
You listen to his
faithful serving boy.

998
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:12,135
People need certainty.

999
01:07:14,063 --> 01:07:15,371
That is his intention.

1000
01:07:15,398 --> 01:07:20,404
Jeet, intentions are one thing.
Actions another.

1001
01:07:20,503 --> 01:07:23,109
The British are like rats
leaving a sinking ship.

1002
01:07:23,173 --> 01:07:28,680
They say the gutters in Lahore
are flowing like rivers of blood.

1003
01:07:28,978 --> 01:07:31,083
People killing each other when
we've lived together for centuries.

1004
01:07:31,147 --> 01:07:33,218
- The army is deserting.
- Listen to me...

1005
01:07:33,283 --> 01:07:36,287
Soldiers keeping their weapons,
groups of militia running wild.

1006
01:07:36,352 --> 01:07:39,629
Listen to me, this is nothing
but a lawless land grab.

1007
01:07:40,156 --> 01:07:42,432
Hovv is Mountbatten sahib
going to stop all the violence?

1008
01:07:42,625 --> 01:07:45,128
Vast mobs have been out
in the streets of Bombay

1009
01:07:45,194 --> 01:07:48,437
during si>< days of violence that have
included murder,

1010
01:07:48,498 --> 01:07:50,341
as well as wrecking, burning
and looting,

1011
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:52,073
a question of state boundaries.

1012
01:07:52,135 --> 01:07:55,412
Curfew was one of the methods
adopted in Delhi

1013
01:07:55,471 --> 01:07:58,111
in an attempt to get the communal
fighting under control.

1014
01:07:58,441 --> 01:08:02,355
So one part of the picture shows
empty streets and locked doors.

1015
01:08:02,445 --> 01:08:05,517
The other picture of Delhi shows
mob violence, the looting of shops,

1016
01:08:05,582 --> 01:08:09,155
and the consequent loss of life
and destruction of property.

1017
01:08:28,071 --> 01:08:29,049
Ubba?

1018
01:08:29,072 --> 01:08:29,573
Aalia!

1019
01:08:30,273 --> 01:08:30,978
Ubba!

1020
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:33,111
Aalia! Wait, wait, wait.

1021
01:08:33,176 --> 01:08:34,177
Ubba?

1022
01:08:37,447 --> 01:08:40,394
What happened? Where is Ubba?

1023
01:08:41,351 --> 01:08:43,297
Where are you, sir? Aalia?

1024
01:08:46,656 --> 01:08:48,294
Covvards!

1025
01:08:49,759 --> 01:08:51,295
Don't you know me?

1026
01:08:52,128 --> 01:08:54,130
Don't you know my father?

1027
01:08:54,197 --> 01:08:55,107
Where's Ubba?

1028
01:08:55,131 --> 01:08:58,078
No violence will be
tolerated in Viceroy's House.

1029
01:08:58,101 --> 01:09:02,447
Perpetrators will be dismissed and
jailed, their families told to leave.

1030
01:09:02,505 --> 01:09:05,384
Ubba? Ubba!

1031
01:09:05,942 --> 01:09:10,448
The harshest measures will be taken.
There will be no riot here!

1032
01:09:10,613 --> 01:09:14,026
It's time for us
to come together now.

1033
01:09:14,050 --> 01:09:18,499
What we face is the most significant
moment

1034
01:09:18,554 --> 01:09:21,330
in the history of this sub-continent.

1035
01:09:21,491 --> 01:09:24,961
Our children and our grandchildren

1036
01:09:25,061 --> 01:09:28,042
may one day ask us hovv we served.

1037
01:09:28,464 --> 01:09:33,607
We must ensure we can be proud
of what we say.

1038
01:09:34,070 --> 01:09:38,485
In less than 3O days now,
India will be divided.

1039
01:09:39,008 --> 01:09:42,421
The partition council has agreed
that the national assets and debt

1040
01:09:42,478 --> 01:09:48,087
will be apportioned 80% to India
and 20% to Pakistan.

1041
01:09:48,384 --> 01:09:52,093
We will be following that same
formula in this great house.

1042
01:09:52,622 --> 01:09:54,101
Finally...

1043
01:09:55,125 --> 01:09:56,763
and I am sorry to say this...

1044
01:09:58,995 --> 01:10:02,033
each one of you must choose which
country will have your allegiance,

1045
01:10:02,131 --> 01:10:03,405
India...

1046
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:04,637
or Pakistan.

1047
01:10:19,015 --> 01:10:20,551
Suhara Kapur, India.

1048
01:10:20,617 --> 01:10:21,618
Next.

1049
01:10:22,519 --> 01:10:24,260
l, too. Pakistan.

1050
01:10:24,654 --> 01:10:25,689
Next.

1051
01:10:27,457 --> 01:10:29,130
Sanjit Gupta.

1052
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:31,138
India.

1053
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:32,264
Next.

1054
01:10:32,662 --> 01:10:34,141

\/Ir Ali.

1055
01:10:34,530 --> 01:10:36,271
Sir, I want to go to Pakistan.

1056
01:10:36,499 --> 01:10:37,705
I wish you well.

1057
01:10:39,169 --> 01:10:41,376
Jeet, what's going to happen to us?

1058
01:10:43,606 --> 01:10:44,482
Come.

1059
01:10:44,574 --> 01:10:46,576
- I'm so scared.
- Come.

1060
01:10:48,178 --> 01:10:52,422
Soup spoons, Fifteen cases for India,
three cases for Pakistan.

1061
01:10:52,482 --> 01:10:56,362
Teaspoons, Forty cases for India,
ten cases for Pakistan.

1062
01:10:57,053 --> 01:11:00,728
Butter knives, Twenty cases for India,
five cases for Pakistan.

1063
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:02,694
Tuba, India.

1064
01:11:02,759 --> 01:11:04,670
French horn, Pakistan.

1065
01:11:10,366 --> 01:11:13,245
Right, what do the latest reports say?

1066
01:11:13,303 --> 01:11:16,113
Ah, vvell, that we know about.

1067
01:11:17,607 --> 01:11:20,247
India. Pakistan.

1068
01:11:22,145 --> 01:11:24,250
- India.
- Next!

1069
01:11:27,350 --> 01:11:29,330
Pakistan.

1070
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:32,030
India. Pakistan.

1071
01:11:34,457 --> 01:11:36,437
India. Pakistan.

1072
01:11:51,341 --> 01:11:52,786
I don't know what to do.

1073
01:11:55,511 --> 01:11:57,320
Your father's a good man.

1074
01:11:58,581 --> 01:11:59,685
He'll understand.

1075
01:12:00,550 --> 01:12:01,722
Aalia.

1076
01:12:03,119 --> 01:12:05,326
We belong together.

1077
01:12:07,991 --> 01:12:09,163
Take this Kara.

1078
01:12:10,326 --> 01:12:12,328
It shows our unity.

1079
01:12:15,398 --> 01:12:16,775
I'm scared.

1080
01:12:20,570 --> 01:12:23,107
Wuthering Heights must come to
Pakistan.

1081
01:12:23,139 --> 01:12:26,450
Then Jane Eyre stays here
and all of the Jane Austen.

1082
01:12:26,509 --> 01:12:28,489
India. Pakistan.

1083
01:12:28,545 --> 01:12:31,788
But we can't break the encyclopaedias.
That would be a crime.

1084
01:12:32,048 --> 01:12:36,463
No, 20% comes to Pakistan.
A to E or S to Z?

1085
01:12:36,519 --> 01:12:39,090
- Give me A to E.
- This is absurd.

1086
01:12:41,257 --> 01:12:43,032
Where communities are so mi><ed

1087
01:12:43,092 --> 01:12:45,732
it is of course impossible to draw
boundaries

1088
01:12:45,795 --> 01:12:48,469
which will segregate Hindus on
the one hand, Muslims on the other.

1089
01:12:48,565 --> 01:12:51,136
Fires raged unchecked in many
places

1090
01:12:51,167 --> 01:12:54,478
while pitched battles continued
between Muslims and Hindus.

1091
01:12:54,537 --> 01:12:57,814
Casualties totalled 3,000 killed
and 8,000 injured.

1092
01:12:58,074 --> 01:13:00,213
Very well. Thank you. Where?

1093
01:13:44,220 --> 01:13:45,790
Ubba, are you comfortable?

1094
01:13:46,055 --> 01:13:47,500
Aalia!

1095
01:13:48,558 --> 01:13:49,332
Jeet.

1096
01:13:49,759 --> 01:13:52,603
I have to take my father to Lahore.

1097
01:13:53,496 --> 01:13:56,272
Asif has very kindly agreed
to take us to the station.

1098
01:13:56,666 --> 01:13:59,408
My father is my first
responsibility, Jeet.

1099
01:13:59,702 --> 01:14:03,047
- I have to do what's best for him.
- Running away isn't best for him.

1100
01:14:03,072 --> 01:14:05,052
I'm trying to keep him alive.

1101
01:14:05,508 --> 01:14:07,454
It's all changed now.

1102
01:14:08,444 --> 01:14:12,085
When people see us, they don't see
Indians any more. We're Muslims.

1103
01:14:12,115 --> 01:14:14,755
Aalia, you are as Indian as I am.

1104
01:14:16,018 --> 01:14:19,192
- India is what we make it.
- Don't make it any harder, please.

1105
01:14:20,189 --> 01:14:23,068
Aalia, please, I am begging you,
don't do this.

1106
01:14:23,126 --> 01:14:24,503
Aalia, are you ready, beta?

1107
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:26,631
- Just a minute, Abba.
- Who's there?

1108
01:14:27,330 --> 01:14:28,331
Jeet Kumar, sir.

1109
01:14:28,397 --> 01:14:32,038
We have to go.
Our train leaves at midnight.

1110
01:14:32,435 --> 01:14:35,575
I hear you helped Aalia and Ubba
when the house was set on fire.

1111
01:14:35,638 --> 01:14:37,276
I thank you for
everything that you did.

1112
01:14:39,442 --> 01:14:42,355
My mother and brother will be at
the station in Lahore to receive you.

1113
01:14:42,712 --> 01:14:46,216
My home will be your home
just as soon as we're married.

1114
01:14:46,282 --> 01:14:49,263
- Tell him. Tell him, Aalia.
- Tell me what?

1115
01:14:52,121 --> 01:14:56,194
I know right now
it's the hardest thing to stay,

1116
01:14:56,259 --> 01:14:57,738
but you are brave.

1117
01:14:59,562 --> 01:15:01,667
- And your father...
- He has to be safe.

1118
01:15:05,435 --> 01:15:07,346
My father must be safe.

1119
01:15:13,276 --> 01:15:14,550
Goodbye, Jeet.

1120
01:15:19,582 --> 01:15:21,255
- We have to go now.
- Kumar?

1121
01:15:30,293 --> 01:15:33,502
I never thought this would
happen to my country.

1122
01:15:34,563 --> 01:15:36,634
But I must, for my daughter's sake.

1123
01:15:40,002 --> 01:15:43,245
ls your future still clouded,
my friend?

1124
01:15:44,507 --> 01:15:46,783
Have you spoken yet
to your young woman?

1125
01:15:50,747 --> 01:15:51,782
Yes, sir.

1126
01:15:53,783 --> 01:15:55,126
It won't happen.

1127
01:15:55,551 --> 01:15:57,087
Why not?

1128
01:15:59,021 --> 01:16:00,329
Because she is leaving...

1129
01:16:01,991 --> 01:16:03,561
on a train for Pakistan.

1130
01:16:13,336 --> 01:16:15,077
It's been an honour knowing you, sir.

1131
01:16:33,089 --> 01:16:34,159
We have to go.

1132
01:16:48,137 --> 01:16:50,117
We'll be safe in Pakistan, Ubba.

1133
01:17:25,975 --> 01:17:28,581

\/Ir Nehru, we in America are
well aware

1134
01:17:28,644 --> 01:17:30,555
of your admiration for
the Soviet Union.

1135
01:17:30,613 --> 01:17:33,457
I admire America too, 
\/Ir Grady.

1136
01:17:33,516 --> 01:17:35,655
Good, I'm glad to hear that.

1137
01:17:35,718 --> 01:17:38,460
There is a lot that
America can do here.

1138
01:17:38,521 --> 01:17:40,125
After freeing ourselves from
one empire,

1139
01:17:40,189 --> 01:17:42,567
we'll not get too close to another.

1140
01:17:42,625 --> 01:17:45,538
India must go her own way.

1141
01:17:45,694 --> 01:17:47,105
Excuse me, sir.

1142
01:17:47,496 --> 01:17:50,443

\/Ir Radcliffe would like to speak
with you.

1143
01:17:51,601 --> 01:17:53,774
With your permission, sir, I'll go.

1144
01:17:56,773 --> 01:17:59,515
I strongly think we need more time.

1145
01:17:59,775 --> 01:18:00,719
Sit down.

1146
01:18:01,244 --> 01:18:04,123
Pug, I don't know if you really
understand,

1147
01:18:04,580 --> 01:18:09,393
but the commission is in deadlock
with every city we come to,

1148
01:18:09,986 --> 01:18:13,195
and I'm most concerned about
the fairness of the thing.

1149
01:18:13,522 --> 01:18:16,662
I wonder if we might not involve
some other body.

1150
01:18:17,059 --> 01:18:18,060
What other body?

1151
01:18:18,427 --> 01:18:20,236
The United Nations, for example.

1152
01:18:20,396 --> 01:18:24,503
And admit that we British
can't see to our own affairs?

1153
01:18:24,534 --> 01:18:29,381
With respect, it's a monstrous
responsibility forjust one man.

1154
01:18:33,542 --> 01:18:35,351
I'm going to go and see Mountbatten.

1155
01:18:35,411 --> 01:18:39,188
Dickie has to stay impartial.
You know that.

1156
01:18:39,248 --> 01:18:43,526
If he comes down on either side,
the vvhole thing will blow up.

1157
01:18:43,586 --> 01:18:45,759
It's got to be a clean cut.

1158
01:18:46,022 --> 01:18:51,131
It's a bloody axe, Pug, cleaving
right through people's lives.

1159
01:18:58,200 --> 01:19:01,044
This might be everything you need.

1160
01:19:12,014 --> 01:19:16,156
It's a policy document drawn up by
Churchill when he was Prime Minister.

1161
01:19:16,285 --> 01:19:17,320
Two years ago.

1162
01:19:17,486 --> 01:19:20,057
It sets out the future of India.

1163
01:19:23,325 --> 01:19:25,999
It should make your task easier.

1164
01:19:29,632 --> 01:19:30,975
What's this map?

1165
01:19:31,033 --> 01:19:35,106
It was drawn up by Viceroy Wavell
last year.

1166
01:19:36,505 --> 01:19:39,281
I don't understand. There's already
a boundary line there.

1167
01:19:39,341 --> 01:19:42,049
I've been asked to pass it on to you.

1168
01:19:42,611 --> 01:19:45,023
By whom? Mountbatten?

1169
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:47,492
No. He knows nothing of it.

1170
01:19:48,350 --> 01:19:52,025
This comes right from the top,
Radcliffe.

1171
01:19:52,288 --> 01:19:58,398
We didn't beat the Nazis and the Japs
to give away the shop to the Soviets.

1172
01:20:02,098 --> 01:20:07,207
As you can see, there are no
straight lines in India.

1173
01:20:23,385 --> 01:20:26,059
There are hundreds coming every day.

1174
01:20:26,255 --> 01:20:27,757
Thousands in the city.

1175
01:20:28,758 --> 01:20:30,601
The stories they tell...

1176
01:20:33,229 --> 01:20:35,675
This isn't part of
Daddy's plan, is it?

1177
01:20:39,768 --> 01:20:45,343
This way, this way.
Please, keep moving. Keep moving.

1178
01:21:01,123 --> 01:21:02,761
Duleep!

1179
01:21:04,059 --> 01:21:05,470
What happened?

1180
01:21:05,728 --> 01:21:09,141
Are any of our family here?

1181
01:21:09,431 --> 01:21:10,341
No.

1182
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,537
Then I was... I was too late.

1183
01:21:14,136 --> 01:21:15,308
It was destroyed.

1184
01:21:15,337 --> 01:21:18,648
- What?
- Our village. They're all gone.

1185
01:21:18,707 --> 01:21:23,213
Men came from miles around,
destroying.

1186
01:21:23,579 --> 01:21:25,718
Our families are gone.

1187
01:21:26,248 --> 01:21:28,592
My mother? My sisters?

1188
01:21:29,385 --> 01:21:30,796
I couldn't find them.

1189
01:21:31,754 --> 01:21:34,598
I hope to God they are in
a refugee camp somewhere.

1190
01:21:35,157 --> 01:21:36,727
This girl I found in a barn.

1191
01:21:38,661 --> 01:21:39,731
The only one left.

1192
01:21:42,164 --> 01:21:45,168
All the way back, the dead lying
by the road.

1193
01:21:45,301 --> 01:21:48,441
Women jumped in the well
rather than be raped.

1194
01:22:08,491 --> 01:22:11,062
Sir, the boundary line is drawn.

1195
01:22:13,395 --> 01:22:17,275
We shan't announce this until after
the independence celebrations.

1196
01:22:17,533 --> 01:22:18,773
Why on earth?

1197
01:22:19,535 --> 01:22:22,482
The pressure I've been under
to produce that by today.

1198
01:22:23,072 --> 01:22:25,552
Let them have the joy of
their independence days

1199
01:22:25,608 --> 01:22:28,384
and face the misery of
the situation afterwards.

1200
01:22:29,111 --> 01:22:32,524
There will be carnage, sir,
either way.

1201
01:22:32,648 --> 01:22:37,358
All the leaders believe that partition
will reduce the violence, not inflame it.

1202
01:22:37,586 --> 01:22:39,566
I've done a wholly inadequate job.

1203
01:22:41,090 --> 01:22:42,467
I'm sorry you think so.

1204
01:22:43,425 --> 01:22:46,531
In all conscience,
I cannot accept my fee.

1205
01:22:51,467 --> 01:22:53,174
I believe...

1206
01:22:53,435 --> 01:22:55,176
that you rather love this country.

1207
01:22:58,474 --> 01:23:01,353
I think you deserve to know.

1208
01:23:46,021 --> 01:23:48,501
Our porter is ready to load.

1209
01:23:53,596 --> 01:23:55,633
Do you think we'll have enough?

1210
01:23:56,432 --> 01:23:59,413
There are too many people,
Lady Sahib.

1211
01:24:00,135 --> 01:24:03,344
If we work all night,
we would still not have enough.

1212
01:24:04,573 --> 01:24:06,712
Let me see what I can do.

1213
01:24:19,254 --> 01:24:21,165
Which train did Aalia take?

1214
01:24:23,358 --> 01:24:25,599
The night train, the last train.

1215
01:24:33,469 --> 01:24:35,449
It says there are no survivors.

1216
01:25:11,373 --> 01:25:13,979
- Dickie, the refugees...
- Not now.

1217
01:25:19,014 --> 01:25:20,391
Please leave us.

1218
01:25:25,988 --> 01:25:27,729
This is why Jinnah wouldn't budge.

1219
01:25:28,157 --> 01:25:30,569
He'd already been promised
his Pakistan!

1220
01:25:30,626 --> 01:25:33,197
Why the hell did no one tell me?

1221
01:25:33,462 --> 01:25:35,464
So you could better do yourjob.

1222
01:25:35,531 --> 01:25:39,638
My job? Double-dealing
with men I've come to revere?

1223
01:25:39,702 --> 01:25:41,238
What do you mean, double-dealing?

1224
01:25:41,370 --> 01:25:45,443
You were perfectly honest,
and they gave you their trust,

1225
01:25:45,507 --> 01:25:46,679
as we hoped they would.

1226
01:25:46,742 --> 01:25:49,655
So I could urge them
to your foregone conclusion?

1227
01:25:50,045 --> 01:25:53,322
We have to protect our interests here.

1228
01:25:53,715 --> 01:25:55,456
Churchill can see it.

1229
01:25:55,517 --> 01:25:56,587
See what?

1230
01:25:57,085 --> 01:25:59,087
The future.

1231
01:25:59,254 --> 01:26:02,724
Look at the map.
Look at where the power will lie.

1232
01:26:03,325 --> 01:26:05,396
The Gulf, oil.

1233
01:26:05,961 --> 01:26:11,274
We need to secure our access,
you see, to these huge reserves,

1234
01:26:11,333 --> 01:26:13,609
and block access by others.

1235
01:26:14,169 --> 01:26:19,084
We'll have that security,
courtesy of Pakistan.

1236
01:26:20,309 --> 01:26:23,313
You've divided India for oil?

1237
01:26:23,545 --> 01:26:26,025
For security.

1238
01:26:26,548 --> 01:26:28,687
There's a Soviet empire.

1239
01:26:29,718 --> 01:26:34,360
Stalin needs a warm-water
eastern port.

1240
01:26:34,723 --> 01:26:38,227
He's had his sights set on Karachi.

1241
01:26:38,427 --> 01:26:39,997
He won't get it now.

1242
01:26:40,195 --> 01:26:42,334
Pakistan will be easier to influence

1243
01:26:42,397 --> 01:26:44,536
than an unruly India with
its socialist leanings?

1244
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:46,638
ls that what you imagine?

1245
01:26:46,735 --> 01:26:49,511
It's not my place to imagine.

1246
01:26:49,738 --> 01:26:52,651
You have used me and my family.

1247
01:26:52,708 --> 01:26:56,349
You came here to serve
your king and country

1248
01:26:56,411 --> 01:26:58,448
and you've done so admirably.

1249
01:26:58,514 --> 01:27:02,485
I hear they're promoting you
from Viscount to Earl.

1250
01:27:03,619 --> 01:27:07,396
What about the people whose lives
have been destroyed by this?

1251
01:27:07,456 --> 01:27:08,730
That is unfortunate.

1252
01:27:09,257 --> 01:27:12,534
- Nobody foresaw...
- Blood is on your hands for this.

1253
01:27:12,594 --> 01:27:14,471
But Dickie...

1254
01:27:14,530 --> 01:27:16,669
it's your name on the plan.

1255
01:27:18,100 --> 01:27:21,377
It will always be known
as the Mountbatten Plan.

1256
01:27:25,273 --> 01:27:27,014
Good evening, Your Excellency.

1257
01:28:05,314 --> 01:28:07,157
What the hell is this?

1258
01:28:08,250 --> 01:28:10,093
You said you would protect us.

1259
01:28:12,321 --> 01:28:14,267
You have torn India to pieces.

1260
01:28:22,431 --> 01:28:25,071
- Everyone I loved is dead.
- Kumar...

1261
01:28:25,167 --> 01:28:27,670
ls this the price that we pay
for our freedom?

1262
01:28:28,203 --> 01:28:32,117
I have seen many young men
lose loved ones in the war.

1263
01:28:33,041 --> 01:28:36,045
- And in time...
- You have lost no one, nothing!

1264
01:28:37,245 --> 01:28:40,454
In time, you will go back
to England, untouched.

1265
01:28:41,383 --> 01:28:43,556
You will forget what you have
done here.

1266
01:28:44,052 --> 01:28:44,757
Never.

1267
01:28:49,158 --> 01:28:51,764
I cannot serve you any more, sir.

1268
01:28:52,728 --> 01:28:56,073
I hope you never know
a moment's peace again.

1269
01:29:12,614 --> 01:29:14,287
We shan't go home.

1270
01:29:15,584 --> 01:29:18,360
After the transfer of power,
we'll stay on.

1271
01:29:19,054 --> 01:29:21,091
We must.

1272
01:29:21,256 --> 01:29:23,532
We'll do everything we can.

1273
01:29:24,593 --> 01:29:27,233
This tragedy was not of your making.

1274
01:29:59,294 --> 01:30:01,274
- Hindustan!
- Zindabad!

1275
01:30:01,396 --> 01:30:02,773
- Hindustan!
- Zindabad!

1276
01:30:03,031 --> 01:30:04,567
- Hindustan!
- Zindabad!

1277
01:30:04,633 --> 01:30:06,408
- Hindustan!
- Zindabad!

1278
01:30:06,468 --> 01:30:08,277
- Hindustan!
- Zindabad!

1279
01:30:08,337 --> 01:30:09,748
- Hindustan!
- Zindabad!

1280
01:30:10,005 --> 01:30:11,450
- Hindustan!
- Zindabad!

1281
01:30:11,540 --> 01:30:13,577
- Hindustan!
- Zindabad!

1282
01:30:13,642 --> 01:30:15,246
- Hindustan!
- Zindabad!

1283
01:30:15,344 --> 01:30:17,119
- Hindustan!
- Zindabad!

1284
01:30:17,145 --> 01:30:18,317
- Hindustan!
- Zindabad!

1285
01:30:21,049 --> 01:30:22,460
- Hindustan!
- Zindabad!

1286
01:30:24,119 --> 01:30:25,723
- Hindustan!
- Zindabad!

1287
01:30:26,221 --> 01:30:28,360
The gate of freedom is open in India

1288
01:30:28,423 --> 01:30:31,267
as thousands of Hindus in New Delhi
swarm the streets,

1289
01:30:31,326 --> 01:30:34,796
awaiting their hour of liberation.

1290
01:30:35,163 --> 01:30:38,235
In Karachi, capital of the newly
created Muslim state of Pakistan,

1291
01:30:38,300 --> 01:30:41,611
Lord Louis Mountbatten,
last Viceroy of India,

1292
01:30:41,670 --> 01:30:45,208
arrives to take part in
the official end of British rule.

1293
01:30:54,749 --> 01:30:57,628
I am pleased you can share
in the joyous birth of our nation.

1294
01:30:58,253 --> 01:31:00,563
The impossible dream is a reality.

1295
01:31:00,689 --> 01:31:05,035
It shouldn't be me standing here with
you. It should be Churchill.

1296
01:31:05,594 --> 01:31:08,598
He's the midwife who delivered you
your Pakistan.

1297
01:31:09,364 --> 01:31:13,403
I did what any leader would do
to realise his people's dreams.

1298
01:31:14,569 --> 01:31:17,379
The truth is we've both been used.

1299
01:31:17,606 --> 01:31:19,108
But you got what you wanted.

1300
01:31:19,441 --> 01:31:23,218
I got only half the country I wanted.

1301
01:31:25,480 --> 01:31:28,552
We will always fear for our existence.

1302
01:31:29,784 --> 01:31:33,391
The British, on the other hand,
got everything they were playing for.

1303
01:31:34,022 --> 01:31:36,127
You are the victors here.

1304
01:31:37,759 --> 01:31:40,638
Predicting the future
is a dangerous game.

1305
01:31:41,797 --> 01:31:44,505
I fear there will be no victors here.

1306
01:31:45,166 --> 01:31:46,509
I have a letter

1307
01:31:47,269 --> 01:31:51,547
from President Harry S Truman
of the United States of America.

1308
01:31:52,741 --> 01:31:55,483
Congratulations to Pakistan

1309
01:31:56,278 --> 01:32:00,749
on its emergence among the family
of nations.

1310
01:32:00,816 --> 01:32:05,492
Long years ago we made a tryst
with destiny,

1311
01:32:05,554 --> 01:32:10,299
and now the time comes when
we shall redeem our pledge.

1312
01:32:10,692 --> 01:32:15,505
At the stroke of the midnight hour,
when the world sleeps,

1313
01:32:15,564 --> 01:32:20,343
India will wake to life and freedom.

1314
01:32:21,703 --> 01:32:27,517
Pakistan shall be a secular country,
where all shall be welcome,

1315
01:32:27,576 --> 01:32:31,683
and I assure you that
we shall not be wanting

1316
01:32:32,047 --> 01:32:35,119
in friendly spirit
with our neighbours.

1317
01:32:35,183 --> 01:32:39,757
We have to build the noble mansion
of free India,

1318
01:32:40,021 --> 01:32:43,127
but our freedom is only possible

1319
01:32:43,191 --> 01:32:46,434
because millions have
suffered and sacrificed.

1320
01:32:46,494 --> 01:32:51,136
We pledge to them
to build a free India

1321
01:32:51,199 --> 01:32:54,237
where all her children may flourish.

1322
01:33:10,318 --> 01:33:12,457
Shouldn't we wake Bapuji?

1323
01:33:16,391 --> 01:33:20,271
He's fine, he's sleeping.
He said there's nothing to celebrate.

1324
01:33:32,741 --> 01:33:35,244
One million people become refugees
overnight.

1325
01:33:35,310 --> 01:33:39,053
Carrying their few possessions,
they flee from savagery and butchery

1326
01:33:39,114 --> 01:33:42,425
that has never been exceeded
even in India's stormy history.

1327
01:33:55,230 --> 01:33:58,677
Another two million are preparing
for their trek.

1328
01:34:09,077 --> 01:34:12,058
Many will never reach their new land.

1329
01:34:12,347 --> 01:34:14,486
The refugee problem is immense.

1330
01:34:14,549 --> 01:34:17,689
Smallpox and cholera are reported
from their camps.

1331
01:34:21,523 --> 01:34:23,400
Bibi Harmeet Kaur. ..

1332
01:34:23,491 --> 01:34:26,529
Jahlad Singh...

1333
01:35:07,168 --> 01:35:10,581
We ask for your patience, please.
There is enough food for everyone.

1334
01:35:10,638 --> 01:35:14,609
Please, move.

1335
01:35:18,380 --> 01:35:21,623
- Give to the children.
- Feed the children first.

1336
01:35:22,117 --> 01:35:24,097
Make sure the children...

1337
01:35:24,486 --> 01:35:25,658
Show me.

1338
01:35:28,757 --> 01:35:31,499
They haven't got enough food. Make
sure supplies are getting through.

1339
01:35:31,559 --> 01:35:36,770
Chandan Devi, Ivlandeep Singh,
Faishala Wad...

1340
01:35:53,481 --> 01:35:55,324
Sorry.

1341
01:35:55,383 --> 01:35:56,623
Nehruji.

1342
01:35:58,486 --> 01:36:00,363
Bring back my family.

1343
01:36:00,422 --> 01:36:02,493
I want my family back.

1344
01:36:04,726 --> 01:36:07,969
Forgive me, forgive me.

1345
01:36:30,318 --> 01:36:33,094
Daddy? Daddy?

1346
01:36:33,288 --> 01:36:35,097
Let's not have this.

1347
01:36:35,156 --> 01:36:37,466
Can't let the side down.

1348
01:36:37,525 --> 01:36:39,232
Not in public.

1349
01:36:53,241 --> 01:36:55,243
Some help over here, please.

1350
01:36:57,045 --> 01:36:59,355
My daughter.
My daughter, she is very sick.

1351
01:36:59,414 --> 01:37:03,385
This one is very weak, half-starved.
Jeet, find a stretcher!

1352
01:37:37,419 --> 01:37:40,093
Father's name?

1353
01:37:40,121 --> 01:37:43,125
- My daughter, she is very sick.
- What is your family name?

1354
01:37:43,191 --> 01:37:47,298
Bibi Jind Kaur Bedi,
Machine Mala, one.

1355
01:37:47,429 --> 01:37:48,703
District Jhelum.

1356
01:37:49,164 --> 01:37:52,737
- And your daughter?
- I had a daughter like her.

1357
01:37:53,134 --> 01:37:54,511
A mob took her away.

1358
01:37:55,103 --> 01:37:58,107
I found this girl
on the railway tracks.

1359
01:37:58,173 --> 01:38:02,053
He father pushed her off the train
before everyone was killed.

1360
01:38:02,110 --> 01:38:03,180
So she is a Muslim.

1361
01:38:03,244 --> 01:38:05,019
- She must go to other camp.
- No.

1362
01:38:05,046 --> 01:38:07,492
- She's my daughter now.
- These are rules you have to follovv.

1363
01:38:07,549 --> 01:38:11,554
We all suffer the same way, no?
Please try to understand.

1364
01:38:11,619 --> 01:38:13,724
- I can't allow it!
- Please try.

1365
01:38:13,989 --> 01:38:18,233
Please try to understand, beta.
She's my daughter now.

1366
01:38:21,062 --> 01:38:23,167
J eet? J eet?

1367
01:38:35,477 --> 01:38:37,753
Please try to understand

1368
01:38:46,421 --> 01:38:47,593
Jeet?

1369
01:38:48,056 --> 01:38:49,364
Jeet Kumar?

1370
01:38:50,058 --> 01:38:52,129
Jeet?

1371
01:38:54,595 --> 01:38:55,630
Jeet?

1372
01:38:55,697 --> 01:38:59,577
He)’, SYOP, please!

1373
01:39:01,569 --> 01:39:03,412
Jeet?

1374
01:39:04,339 --> 01:39:06,376
Sorry, no, ma'am.

1375
01:39:16,484 --> 01:39:17,656
Aalia?

1376
01:39:17,685 --> 01:39:21,462
- Narinder Singh...
- Aalia Noor? Aalia Noor?

1377
01:39:21,522 --> 01:39:24,230
- Go back to line.
- Noor, Aalia.

1378
01:39:24,292 --> 01:39:27,205
Sir, let me assure you,
we're doing all we can.

1379
01:39:27,261 --> 01:39:30,265
