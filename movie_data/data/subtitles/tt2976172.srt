1
00:03:33,545 --> 00:03:35,749
Mom, I don't want to meet dad.

2
00:03:54,505 --> 00:03:55,157
I want to sleep with you.

3
00:04:19,848 --> 00:04:22,401
''We will be successful.''

4
00:04:22,441 --> 00:04:24,742
''We will be successful.''

5
00:04:25,096 --> 00:04:27,300
''We will be successful someday.'' Yeah.
Where are you?

6
00:04:27,337 --> 00:04:29,540
Yes, I am coming.

7
00:04:29,896 --> 00:04:32,962
''We have this faith.''

8
00:04:33,001 --> 00:04:35,073
''Complete faith.''

9
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:39,070
''We will be
successful someday.''

10
00:04:39,977 --> 00:04:43,839
''We will walk hand in hand.''

11
00:04:43,944 --> 00:04:47,774
''We will walk hand in hand.''

12
00:04:48,169 --> 00:04:51,333
''We will walk hand in hand.''

13
00:04:51,464 --> 00:04:54,246
''Someday.''

14
00:04:54,921 --> 00:04:55,157
''We are not afraid.''

15
00:04:58,152 --> 00:05:01,120
''We are not afraid.''

16
00:05:01,641 --> 00:05:05,470
''We will walk hand in hand.''

17
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:09,764
''Someday.''

18
00:05:11,145 --> 00:05:13,534
''Someday.''

19
00:05:13,993 --> 00:05:16,415
''Someday.''

20
00:05:17,257 --> 00:05:22,658
''Today. We are not
afraid.'' Kartik.

21
00:05:23,144 --> 00:05:25,511
''Not afraid.''

22
00:05:25,928 --> 00:05:28,033
''Someday.''

23
00:05:33,608 --> 00:05:35,975
Good morning, friends.
Thought for the day.

24
00:05:36,009 --> 00:05:38,398
If I am not allowed to..
Ravi. Yes.

25
00:05:38,953 --> 00:05:40,993
See Gupta madamís face.

26
00:05:41,769 --> 00:05:43,678
Doesn’t she seem tense?

27
00:05:44,264 --> 00:05:47,166
Seems like Mr. Gupta didn't
return home last night.

28
00:05:49,001 --> 00:05:52,230
If she looks here,
she will come here.

29
00:06:01,385 --> 00:06:02,530
Are you okay?

30
00:06:03,368 --> 00:06:04,350
What happened?

31
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:05,960
Nothing.

32
00:06:07,337 --> 00:06:09,028
Kartik, please.This is school.

33
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:12,038
Exactly. The safest place.
Very funny.

34
00:06:12,424 --> 00:06:14,432
Shall we go to the class? The
assembly is about to end.

35
00:06:14,632 --> 00:06:18,178
Principals lecture has just begun.
She bores for half an hour.

36
00:06:18,665 --> 00:06:19,777
That’s why I was saying..

37
00:06:19,817 --> 00:06:21,726
Can’t we talk about
something else?

38
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,968
We have been talking
since so many days.

39
00:06:28,072 --> 00:06:29,414
What else do we talk about?

40
00:06:29,961 --> 00:06:30,943
Discipline.

41
00:06:31,241 --> 00:06:32,866
Discipline is the only thing..

42
00:06:32,936 --> 00:06:34,878
We know how important
discipline is.

43
00:06:35,912 --> 00:06:37,603
Look. See Gupta ma'am.

44
00:06:37,641 --> 00:06:39,465
in discipline will
not be tolerated.

45
00:06:39,465 --> 00:06:40,708
Who is this guy?

46
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,433
New admission.

47
00:06:42,472 --> 00:06:43,585
Siddhant Rajeshwar.

48
00:06:44,073 --> 00:06:45,349
He was in Doon school earlier.

49
00:06:46,537 --> 00:06:50,050
You are responsible for
your acts, right or wrong.

50
00:06:53,065 --> 00:06:55,072
You didn't come for the assembly.
Where were you?

51
00:06:55,241 --> 00:06:57,445
Not well. I was
here, in the class.

52
00:06:57,769 --> 00:07:00,071
With whom? Kartik
was also not well.

53
00:07:00,424 --> 00:07:01,985
He also had chums?

54
00:07:04,489 --> 00:07:06,758
Okay, tell me. What
were you guys up to?

55
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,225
Nothing, dear.

56
00:07:08,296 --> 00:07:10,435
So what’s the use of
leaving you alone?

57
00:07:11,209 --> 00:07:12,419
Anu didn’t come?

58
00:07:13,129 --> 00:07:15,780
Even today she must have
gone on a date with someone.

59
00:07:18,089 --> 00:07:19,038
Shall we call her up?

60
00:07:25,992 --> 00:07:27,334
Hello.

61
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:28,770
What the ****!

62
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,659
I am with Sandy.

63
00:07:31,336 --> 00:07:32,580
Shut up, you moron!

64
00:07:34,505 --> 00:07:36,447
You know that I must not
have done the homework.

65
00:07:36,936 --> 00:07:38,278
I am depending on you.

66
00:07:38,377 --> 00:07:39,871
Just put my name on
your own notebook..

67
00:07:39,913 --> 00:07:41,058
..and give it to ma'am.

68
00:07:42,825 --> 00:07:45,891
Okay. Fine. See you
in the dance class.

69
00:07:46,536 --> 00:07:47,965
I won't be late today.

70
00:07:48,585 --> 00:07:49,828
Okay. Bye.

71
00:07:53,256 --> 00:07:54,303
Tell me something.

72
00:07:54,984 --> 00:07:55,157
What if your parents find out
that you have bunked school..

73
00:07:58,089 --> 00:07:59,201
..and you are with me?

74
00:07:59,497 --> 00:08:00,162
So?

75
00:08:00,265 --> 00:08:02,654
What do I know? They
are your parents.

76
00:08:04,136 --> 00:08:06,624
First, they will kick your ass.

77
00:08:06,825 --> 00:08:09,475
And then, they will kick my ass.

78
00:08:09,865 --> 00:08:11,774
I will have to endure
their lectures.

79
00:08:11,912 --> 00:08:13,538
And after a few days,
everything will be normal.

80
00:08:13,641 --> 00:08:14,589
Back to school.

81
00:08:14,696 --> 00:08:16,322
So you have thought of
everything beforehand.

82
00:08:16,616 --> 00:08:18,624
Dude, it’s called intelligence.

83
00:08:18,728 --> 00:08:21,314
And I am intelligent enough
to know what’s good for me.

84
00:08:24,873 --> 00:08:27,240
You wanted to tell me
something important, right?

85
00:08:29,961 --> 00:08:31,586
I want to get my portfolio done.

86
00:08:32,072 --> 00:08:34,080
You told me you have a
photographer friend.

87
00:08:34,633 --> 00:08:35,942
I want to be here.

88
00:08:36,905 --> 00:08:39,458
What’s the hurry? You
are still too young.

89
00:08:40,233 --> 00:08:41,477
And you have time.

90
00:08:42,057 --> 00:08:43,333
Okay.Tell me one thing.

91
00:08:43,529 --> 00:08:45,056
What if you don't get there?

92
00:08:45,993 --> 00:08:47,040
I will.

93
00:08:47,721 --> 00:08:48,703
Come what may.

94
00:08:48,904 --> 00:08:50,050
I know I have it in me.

95
00:08:50,216 --> 00:08:52,071
Of course, you have it in you.

96
00:08:52,744 --> 00:08:55,157
I will also say that you
used to go out with me.

97
00:08:55,912 --> 00:08:57,341
Don't forget me.

98
00:08:59,945 --> 00:09:03,458
Come on.You are my baby.
I love you.

99
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:05,214
How can I forget you?

100
00:09:07,529 --> 00:09:09,438
We will reach the top together.

101
00:09:16,617 --> 00:09:18,144
Oh, no!

102
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,495
What were you doing in the car?
Well..

103
00:09:24,489 --> 00:09:27,423
That too early in the morning.

104
00:09:28,425 --> 00:09:30,247
Don’t you have any
other work to do?

105
00:09:30,345 --> 00:09:31,970
We were just going.

106
00:09:32,521 --> 00:09:34,528
Lying down on the seat?

107
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:37,061
Why don’t you speak?

108
00:09:37,929 --> 00:09:39,838
What are you doing?
What is this?

109
00:09:40,105 --> 00:09:40,901
Bribe?

110
00:09:41,065 --> 00:09:43,170
I don’t take bribe.
Keep it with you.

111
00:09:43,497 --> 00:09:45,985
Keep it, uncle. Shouldn't say
no to the first customer.

112
00:09:46,281 --> 00:09:48,190
You are a Jat? Yes, uncle.

113
00:09:48,264 --> 00:09:49,758
From where? Rohtak.

114
00:09:50,184 --> 00:09:52,289
My uncle’s in law’s
house was in Rohtak.

115
00:09:52,393 --> 00:09:54,368
We used to go there in
childhood to eat mangoes.

116
00:09:54,601 --> 00:09:55,157
Okay. Tell me. Who is she?

117
00:09:58,153 --> 00:10:00,062
Girlfriend? Yes, uncle.

118
00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:04,007
Okay. Do one thing. Park the
car a little ahead. Fine?

119
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:05,535
And do whatever you want to do.

120
00:10:05,577 --> 00:10:07,486
A VIP car is going to
pass from this way. Okay?

121
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,316
Go. Come on. Take the car ahead.

122
00:10:09,417 --> 00:10:10,278
Come on.

123
00:10:12,201 --> 00:10:12,867
Scoundrel.

124
00:10:13,161 --> 00:10:14,208
Let’s move from here.

125
00:10:37,469 --> 00:10:41,047
Dad said he will buy
me D&G if I score 90%.

126
00:10:41,097 --> 00:10:43,999
Let me tell you.. Ashwin,
I need eco notes.

127
00:10:44,073 --> 00:10:46,407
There is a test on Monday.
And I have no clue.

128
00:10:47,393 --> 00:10:49,117
My notes are not complete.

129
00:10:50,537 --> 00:10:51,781
Take it from somebody else.

130
00:10:51,849 --> 00:10:53,125
Give it, man.

131
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,695
Get lost.

132
00:11:01,441 --> 00:11:03,350
Buddha said believe nothing.

133
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,505
Just because the so called
wise person said it.

134
00:11:05,792 --> 00:11:06,807
Believe nothing.

135
00:11:06,944 --> 00:11:08,919
Just because it is
said in ancient books.

136
00:11:09,128 --> 00:11:10,077
Believe nothing.

137
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,542
Just because it is said
to be of divine origin.

138
00:11:12,841 --> 00:11:13,789
Believe nothing.

139
00:11:13,897 --> 00:11:15,806
Just because someone
else believes it.

140
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:20,135
Believe only what you yourself
test and judge to be true.

141
00:11:20,232 --> 00:11:21,093
Thank you.

142
00:11:22,664 --> 00:11:25,447
Every religion claims to be
the ultimate path to God.

143
00:11:25,513 --> 00:11:27,520
But every religion has
a different concept..

144
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,186
..of who or what God is.

145
00:11:31,017 --> 00:11:32,097
God exists.

146
00:11:32,552 --> 00:11:36,130
If God didn’t exist, so many
people wouldn’t be worshiping Him.

147
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,339
So many people can’t be dumb.

148
00:11:39,016 --> 00:11:40,128
He is so dumb. Do you know?

149
00:11:40,169 --> 00:11:41,762
You were there for
the debate, right?

150
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,905
With great difficulty I
controlled my laughter.

151
00:11:44,169 --> 00:11:45,729
He just looked cute.

152
00:11:45,929 --> 00:11:47,816
Tanisha, nobody is perfect.

153
00:11:47,849 --> 00:11:50,566
Yes. He is just dumb.
What to do with brains?

154
00:11:50,696 --> 00:11:53,380
But you have dumped so
many guys before too.

155
00:11:53,449 --> 00:11:55,107
Some guys score less marks.

156
00:11:55,177 --> 00:11:57,217
Some don’t ready any books
besides school books.

157
00:11:57,289 --> 00:11:59,231
Some don’t have a
sense of humor.

158
00:11:59,336 --> 00:12:02,053
And the best is Kunal.
He is such a 16yearold.

159
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,324
Come on, dear. You
are exaggerating.

160
00:12:04,744 --> 00:12:06,915
I mean, I am not
asking for much.

161
00:12:06,953 --> 00:12:08,480
Just a normal boy.

162
00:12:08,648 --> 00:12:10,787
With good looks,
good sense of humor.

163
00:12:10,985 --> 00:12:14,400
He should be a little matured.
And very intelligent.

164
00:12:14,536 --> 00:12:16,641
I am not interested
in these dumb boys.

165
00:12:17,128 --> 00:12:18,176
Great!

166
00:12:18,632 --> 00:12:20,639
Come on. Perfect
guys also exist.

167
00:12:20,872 --> 00:12:22,880
Ashwin is perfect. Ashwin.

168
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,967
Yuck! Not him. Okay?

169
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,186
He is in love with you.
No ways. Okay?

170
00:12:29,512 --> 00:12:31,138
He is my best guy
friend.That's it.

171
00:12:31,528 --> 00:12:33,317
You are so innocent, aren’t you?

172
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,785
Lt can be seen on his face.

173
00:12:34,889 --> 00:12:36,896
in bold, capital.

174
00:12:37,544 --> 00:12:40,544
Come on, dear. Please. Don't
spread such rumors about him.

175
00:12:40,712 --> 00:12:42,567
I have reached my bus stop.
I will leave. Okay.

176
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,364
Bye. Bye.

177
00:12:43,464 --> 00:12:44,806
See you. See you.

178
00:12:51,944 --> 00:12:53,122
Here, Mr. Kapoor.

179
00:12:53,673 --> 00:12:54,949
This is your future home.

180
00:12:55,016 --> 00:12:55,157
I don't lie. Shall I
tell you something?

181
00:12:57,736 --> 00:12:59,776
This house that I am showing
you is not a house..

182
00:12:59,816 --> 00:13:01,474
..but a sweet home.

183
00:13:01,704 --> 00:13:04,421
A lady lives here. And her
niece lives with her.

184
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,113
That's it.They are
very nice people.

185
00:13:06,313 --> 00:13:08,353
You must have heard
about the riots.

186
00:13:08,841 --> 00:13:11,328
Their relatives
died in that fire.

187
00:13:11,688 --> 00:13:13,630
Since then they are giving
their house on rent.

188
00:13:14,568 --> 00:13:15,550
Here she comes.

189
00:13:16,584 --> 00:13:17,664
Sister, hello.

190
00:13:17,768 --> 00:13:19,012
Hello. Hello.

191
00:13:19,401 --> 00:13:21,441
Hello. We got late
because of the traffic.

192
00:13:22,312 --> 00:13:23,240
lt's okay.

193
00:13:23,368 --> 00:13:26,336
I told you. I will get a
very decent paying guest.

194
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,677
He is a writer.A writer.

195
00:13:28,968 --> 00:13:32,034
And who can be more decent
than a writer? Right?

196
00:13:32,137 --> 00:13:34,308
He has come from London,
to write a book.

197
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,742
He is a nice man. He
is my acquaintance.

198
00:13:36,808 --> 00:13:39,197
Even if you slap him, he
won't say anything.Yes.

199
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,691
No.You are also decent.
Why will you slap him?

200
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,549
Tea? Sister, bring tea.

201
00:13:44,744 --> 00:13:45,922
Yes. Sure. Excuse me.

202
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:47,837
I would like to see the
place first please.

203
00:13:48,136 --> 00:13:50,046
Yeah, of course. lt'son
the first floor.

204
00:13:51,945 --> 00:13:53,123
Yes, Chotu.Tell me.

205
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,157
I have the key of
flat number 12.

206
00:13:56,393 --> 00:13:58,946
Do one thing.Tell the party to wait.
I will come. Fine?

207
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,950
Mr. Kapoor,you look around.
I have seen it.

208
00:14:02,089 --> 00:14:03,103
I will come in 10 minutes.

209
00:14:03,144 --> 00:14:05,446
Sister, I have discussed the
monetary matter with him. Okay?

210
00:14:06,504 --> 00:14:09,286
Will you live alone?
I mean,your family?

211
00:14:09,673 --> 00:14:10,883
No. I am single. Oh.

212
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,869
ls that a problem?

213
00:14:12,136 --> 00:14:13,511
No. Not a problem.

214
00:14:15,337 --> 00:14:16,962
A kid stays with you?

215
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:18,973
Yeah.Tanu. My niece.

216
00:14:19,816 --> 00:14:21,824
But don't worry. She
won't disturb you.

217
00:14:21,864 --> 00:14:22,846
She is not that small.

218
00:14:23,176 --> 00:14:24,932
Writers need peace. I know.

219
00:14:25,768 --> 00:14:27,143
How many writers do you know?

220
00:14:30,024 --> 00:14:32,807
If I wanted peace, I would
have lived in the hills.

221
00:14:33,288 --> 00:14:34,532
I wouldn't have come here.

222
00:14:34,729 --> 00:14:36,638
I want to see Delhi closely.

223
00:14:37,128 --> 00:14:39,397
I want to be surrounded by
the vitality of the city.

224
00:14:39,624 --> 00:14:41,053
I want to experience it.

225
00:14:55,593 --> 00:14:58,342
When did you come from London?
10 days.

226
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:01,152
You know, I think I am
getting a little late.

227
00:15:05,064 --> 00:15:06,886
That's my niece,Tanisha.

228
00:15:08,137 --> 00:15:09,959
Hi. Hi.

229
00:15:11,304 --> 00:15:13,693
So, how do you like the place?

230
00:15:24,105 --> 00:15:25,349
Nice.

231
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,157
Sir has major hots for you.
Why do you do that?

232
00:15:55,977 --> 00:15:58,278
lt's fine. Old man was lustful.

233
00:15:58,665 --> 00:15:59,974
I am so sexy, right?

234
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,593
You are so cheap.

235
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:05,023
He is so old. What will he do?

236
00:16:05,321 --> 00:16:08,288
Just imagine. Sex while
doing'Kathak' (lndian dance).

237
00:16:08,392 --> 00:16:09,636
That would be cool, right?

238
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:16,805
What is there?

239
00:16:17,384 --> 00:16:19,108
There is a boy in the house.

240
00:16:19,944 --> 00:16:23,173
God! You desperate girls.
Haven't you ever seen a guy?

241
00:16:23,432 --> 00:16:25,374
Please. He is awesome.

242
00:16:25,768 --> 00:16:27,841
I guess he is Kamat madam's son.

243
00:16:28,808 --> 00:16:30,718
Where is ma'am? I don't know.

244
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,186
Mom had called up. She will
be here in 10 minutes.

245
00:16:37,695 --> 00:16:40,062
Meanwhile, revise your chapter.

246
00:16:40,841 --> 00:16:42,117
Excuse me.

247
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:46,210
Actually, we couldn't
understand an equation.

248
00:16:46,536 --> 00:16:47,747
So can you please help us out?

249
00:16:47,784 --> 00:16:50,086
Sorry. I study film making.

250
00:16:50,441 --> 00:16:51,902
Didn't you pass your 11th?

251
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:53,687
Haven't you seen those boards?

252
00:16:53,793 --> 00:16:55,157
Failed 7th, 8th, 9th standard.

253
00:16:55,612 --> 00:16:56,757
And pass 12th directly.

254
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:59,895
So you will make serials, right?

255
00:16:59,945 --> 00:17:01,832
Those slaughterings and
motherin law types.

256
00:17:01,992 --> 00:17:04,163
Haven't you seen anything
beyond Bollywood?

257
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:10,754
He is hot. But he has
a lot of attitude.

258
00:17:12,616 --> 00:17:13,631
Did he kiss you?

259
00:17:14,441 --> 00:17:15,389
I she a good kisser?

260
00:17:15,465 --> 00:17:16,413
I don't know.

261
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:19,270
I will know when I will
kiss someone else.

262
00:17:19,305 --> 00:17:21,061
I mean, I have no
point of comparison.

263
00:17:21,225 --> 00:17:23,241
If you want, I can
get you someone.

264
00:17:23,241 --> 00:17:25,128
For what? For comparison.

265
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:26,973
That would be fun.

266
00:17:27,273 --> 00:17:28,221
Okay.Tell me.

267
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:30,053
When do you plan to
do the real thing?

268
00:17:30,153 --> 00:17:32,258
Not now. I am not ready yet.

269
00:17:33,897 --> 00:17:35,423
You will die a virgin.

270
00:17:35,496 --> 00:17:36,958
No. that's not true.

271
00:17:37,033 --> 00:17:40,349
lt's just that I will do it. But at
the right time, at the right place.

272
00:17:40,425 --> 00:17:41,352
I will do it.

273
00:17:41,641 --> 00:17:44,259
Come on. Just cut this crap. You
can do it anytime, anywhere.

274
00:17:44,361 --> 00:17:45,702
Like we have done it in the car.

275
00:17:45,992 --> 00:17:49,058
Gross. How did your legs
fit in the backseat?

276
00:17:49,161 --> 00:17:50,852
You'll learn.You'll learn.

277
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:53,854
Okay, Ms.Virgin.
Want to go to disco?

278
00:17:53,961 --> 00:17:54,888
Now?

279
00:17:55,273 --> 00:17:56,614
Dumb, at night.

280
00:17:59,017 --> 00:18:00,805
ls that a joke? No.

281
00:18:01,352 --> 00:18:01,951
Kartik.

282
00:18:03,465 --> 00:18:04,326
Same thing.

283
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:07,107
Desperate. Call him too.

284
00:18:07,593 --> 00:18:09,698
But my mom won't
allow me at night.

285
00:18:11,016 --> 00:18:13,537
Why do you always harp
on mom like a kid?

286
00:18:13,832 --> 00:18:14,814
Grow up.

287
00:18:14,921 --> 00:18:16,164
You should not always
tell your mom the truth.

288
00:18:16,264 --> 00:18:17,791
lt's not good for your health.

289
00:18:18,088 --> 00:18:19,714
Tomorrow is Saturday. No school.

290
00:18:22,888 --> 00:18:23,936
What?

291
00:18:25,481 --> 00:18:26,342
What happened?

292
00:18:26,409 --> 00:18:27,456
Rishi.

293
00:18:29,577 --> 00:18:30,722
He is coming.

294
00:18:33,929 --> 00:18:35,238
I want to talk to you.

295
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:37,950
Rishi, stop bugging me.

296
00:18:38,248 --> 00:18:39,176
Listen.

297
00:18:41,064 --> 00:18:42,079
Why are you doing this?

298
00:18:42,665 --> 00:18:43,777
Just get lost.

299
00:18:43,816 --> 00:18:46,118
Anu, don’t be a witch.
Shutup,you dog.

300
00:18:54,056 --> 00:18:55,157
He is still after you?

301
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:56,575
What is he saying?

302
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,109
Why did you dump me?
Why did you dump me?

303
00:18:58,185 --> 00:18:59,133
Why did you dump me?

304
00:18:59,176 --> 00:19:00,104
Why did you dump him?

305
00:19:00,136 --> 00:19:01,762
I don't remember. 2 months.

306
00:19:01,865 --> 00:19:03,774
How many did you dump after him?

307
00:19:03,881 --> 00:19:05,190
Shut up. I am not so bad.

308
00:19:05,288 --> 00:19:07,111
Let's go. Otherwise this
scoundrel will come back.

309
00:19:12,425 --> 00:19:13,854
What are you doing here?

310
00:19:15,176 --> 00:19:16,802
You guys sit. I will just come.

311
00:19:19,305 --> 00:19:21,377
Here.Your eco notes.

312
00:19:21,864 --> 00:19:24,996
Thank you so much for your
kindness, Your Majesty.

313
00:19:25,096 --> 00:19:27,398
Keep it with you.
Nidhi gave it to me.

314
00:19:27,689 --> 00:19:29,314
Come on, Tanisha.

315
00:19:29,609 --> 00:19:31,518
I have especially come
to give it to you.

316
00:19:32,552 --> 00:19:34,494
At that time I was
a little upset.

317
00:19:35,369 --> 00:19:36,613
Why were you upset?

318
00:19:38,216 --> 00:19:40,605
Just like that.

319
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:41,789
Hello.

320
00:19:42,089 --> 00:19:44,577
Yes,tell me,Anu.Tonight?

321
00:19:45,032 --> 00:19:46,210
ls Nidhi coming?

322
00:19:46,985 --> 00:19:48,229
What time?

323
00:19:49,384 --> 00:19:51,359
Okay. Done. Listen,
Ashwin is also coming.

324
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:53,958
Don't be mean. Okay?

325
00:19:54,057 --> 00:19:55,157
Bye. Okay. Bye.

326
00:19:56,681 --> 00:19:58,568
I am going. Fine? Bye.

327
00:19:58,857 --> 00:19:59,904
Wait.

328
00:19:59,944 --> 00:20:01,766
Come here. Sit.

329
00:20:09,225 --> 00:20:11,396
Man,what's your problem?

330
00:20:11,497 --> 00:20:13,406
I mean, first you show attitude.

331
00:20:13,673 --> 00:20:15,233
And then you say you were upset.

332
00:20:15,624 --> 00:20:17,894
And then you don’t even tell me
the reason why you were upset.

333
00:20:18,024 --> 00:20:20,129
I am so confused.

334
00:20:20,872 --> 00:20:22,498
What do you want in life?

335
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,829
I want you,Tanisha.

336
00:20:25,385 --> 00:20:26,846
I love you.

337
00:20:38,088 --> 00:20:39,201
Liar.

338
00:20:40,616 --> 00:20:42,591
I don't deserve you.

339
00:20:43,752 --> 00:20:44,897
Hello?

340
00:20:45,993 --> 00:20:47,683
I am talking to you.

341
00:20:49,917 --> 00:20:52,568
Oh God! You can be
so irritating, man.

342
00:20:53,737 --> 00:20:55,157
Forget it. What's the use
of being angry with you?

343
00:21:00,264 --> 00:21:01,213
Want to come to the disco?

344
00:21:01,417 --> 00:21:02,661
I don't have money.

345
00:21:02,856 --> 00:21:04,100
I also don't have it.

346
00:21:04,168 --> 00:21:05,924
What are Anu and
her boyfriends or?

347
00:21:08,456 --> 00:21:10,660
But will your dad allow?

348
00:21:11,913 --> 00:21:13,407
To hell with him.

349
00:21:13,641 --> 00:21:15,070
He says only one thing.

350
00:21:15,144 --> 00:21:17,533
You have to do IAS.
You have to do lAS.

351
00:21:18,056 --> 00:21:18,885
I am fed up.

352
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,342
Tell him it's enough that
you clear your 11th.

353
00:21:21,896 --> 00:21:25,857
I know. I will be happy to
join a call center. But dad..

354
00:21:26,313 --> 00:21:28,996
ls there long term scope
in a call center?

355
00:21:29,672 --> 00:21:32,738
Tanisha, long term is too long.

356
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,669
Mom, Anu is coming
to pick me up.

357
00:21:36,744 --> 00:21:38,370
I will stay in her
house for the night.

358
00:21:38,409 --> 00:21:41,573
Will you study or have fun?
Both.

359
00:21:41,673 --> 00:21:44,422
Fine. But return early
in the morning. Okay.

360
00:21:48,328 --> 00:21:49,735
Where are you going?

361
00:21:51,496 --> 00:21:53,700
I am going to the disco with Anu.
Don't tell mama. Okay?

362
00:21:55,721 --> 00:21:56,866
We are going.

363
00:21:57,256 --> 00:21:58,882
You know we are going
to have so much of fun.

364
00:21:59,176 --> 00:22:00,354
Who is he?

365
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,328
Hi. Hi.

366
00:22:03,432 --> 00:22:04,993
He is our PG.

367
00:22:05,289 --> 00:22:07,111
Come on. Hurry up. Or
else we will be late.

368
00:22:07,305 --> 00:22:08,930
Yes. Come on.

369
00:22:09,288 --> 00:22:12,768
Not at all means not at all. No.

370
00:22:12,872 --> 00:22:14,116
I won't allow it.

371
00:22:14,217 --> 00:22:16,126
Everyday you get to see
something on the TV.

372
00:22:16,424 --> 00:22:17,853
There are so many cases.

373
00:22:17,928 --> 00:22:20,233
But you are not at all worried.

374
00:22:20,233 --> 00:22:23,200
She is our daughter,
not our neighbor's.

375
00:22:23,496 --> 00:22:25,601
Yes,Anu. I am not coming.

376
00:22:25,993 --> 00:22:27,519
Nidhi. One moment.

377
00:22:27,592 --> 00:22:29,153
Yes, dad? Go and get ready.

378
00:22:29,256 --> 00:22:31,264
Okay. I am getting ready.
Come soon.

379
00:22:33,864 --> 00:22:36,647
You just remain good
in front of the kids.

380
00:22:36,809 --> 00:22:38,150
And make me look bad.

381
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,709
Looking hot, sis.

382
00:22:44,745 --> 00:22:45,693
Rahul! Thanks.

383
00:22:45,768 --> 00:22:47,524
See today's brothers..

384
00:22:48,169 --> 00:22:50,078
Yes,Anu. Okay. I am coming.

385
00:22:50,216 --> 00:22:53,086
Anu has come downstairs. I am going.
Return before 12.

386
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:55,157
But, mom.. You won't stay
at her place for the night.

387
00:22:55,753 --> 00:22:57,279
She is the one who
is spoiling you.

388
00:22:58,377 --> 00:22:59,784
Bye, dad. Bye, Rahul.

389
00:22:59,784 --> 00:23:02,021
Nidhi, one moment. I will
drop you downstairs.

390
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:08,644
Dear,there is no need
to tell you everything.

391
00:23:09,128 --> 00:23:11,332
I know you will
never let me down.

392
00:23:12,008 --> 00:23:13,535
You can trust me, papa.

393
00:23:23,145 --> 00:23:25,152
Here. Thank you, papa.

394
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,382
And yes, return home before 12.

395
00:23:29,609 --> 00:23:30,656
Or else both of us
will be beaten.

396
00:23:30,729 --> 00:23:33,729
I will come, papa. Now you also
don't act like mama. Please.

397
00:23:34,313 --> 00:23:36,222
Okay. Bye. Okay. Bye. Take care.

398
00:24:04,169 --> 00:24:06,307
Try it, babes.You
live only once.

399
00:24:06,664 --> 00:24:09,828
No. Come on. Just one sip.
Taste it and see.

400
00:24:16,841 --> 00:24:20,102
Yuck. lt's so bitter. How
do you guys drink it?

401
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,175
Drink it as a tonic. Shut up.

402
00:24:22,216 --> 00:24:24,103
I don't like it and all.

403
00:24:25,385 --> 00:24:26,879
Hey, Anu. Hey.

404
00:24:27,016 --> 00:24:29,318
This is Akash.
Akash, this is Anu.

405
00:24:29,352 --> 00:24:30,727
Hi. Hi. Nice to meet you.

406
00:24:30,824 --> 00:24:32,166
Anu wants to get her
portfolio done.

407
00:24:32,617 --> 00:24:35,519
Sure.Take my number from
Sandy and call me tomorrow.

408
00:24:35,593 --> 00:24:36,673
Okay. Cool.

409
00:24:36,936 --> 00:24:38,016
Let's go inside. Come on.

410
00:25:40,969 --> 00:25:48,737
''There lies a thin line
between you and me.''

411
00:25:50,633 --> 00:25:52,902
''On this side is friendship.''

412
00:25:52,936 --> 00:25:55,157
''On that side love.''

413
00:25:55,464 --> 00:25:59,109
''I have to cross this line.''

414
00:25:59,209 --> 00:26:02,176
''I need to take that step.''

415
00:26:02,888 --> 00:26:09,664
''But it's going to me all
the day frustrating.''

416
00:26:09,896 --> 00:26:11,806
''And just been waiting.''

417
00:26:12,776 --> 00:26:15,329
''For me on the style.''

418
00:26:15,656 --> 00:26:19,551
''For me to make
the first move.''

419
00:26:21,128 --> 00:26:28,101
''Maybe baby you
are only a love.''

420
00:26:28,392 --> 00:26:30,596
''But true love.''

421
00:26:31,272 --> 00:26:35,779
''The way your body moves.''

422
00:26:36,072 --> 00:26:40,513
''It shows that it does.''

423
00:26:41,576 --> 00:26:48,766
''Maybe baby you
don't realize.''

424
00:26:48,841 --> 00:26:51,230
''That true love.''

425
00:26:51,913 --> 00:26:55,157
''The way your body moves.''

426
00:26:56,553 --> 00:27:01,255
''It shows that it does.''

427
00:27:01,769 --> 00:27:04,257
''Maybe baby, baby, baby.''

428
00:27:04,328 --> 00:27:07,143
''Maybe baby, baby, baby.''

429
00:27:10,953 --> 00:27:13,341
''lt's only love.''

430
00:27:13,737 --> 00:27:16,038
''lt's only love.''

431
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,553
''Maybe baby, baby, baby.''

432
00:27:19,784 --> 00:27:22,501
''Maybe baby, baby, baby.''

433
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:29,310
''lt's only love.''

434
00:27:31,529 --> 00:27:34,977
''lt's only love.''

435
00:27:37,737 --> 00:27:41,032
Kartik, do you think mothers
have a sixth sense?

436
00:27:43,209 --> 00:27:45,031
You are not listening
to what I am saying.

437
00:27:45,065 --> 00:27:45,893
Kartik.

438
00:27:45,929 --> 00:27:47,456
I am listening.

439
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,182
Do you know? Since the
time she has seen us..

440
00:27:49,257 --> 00:27:50,500
..at the parents
teacher meeting..

441
00:27:50,633 --> 00:27:52,421
..she is like, ''Stay
away from boys.''

442
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:55,101
''Concentrate on your studies.''

443
00:27:55,496 --> 00:27:57,885
I think she has even told dad.

444
00:27:59,784 --> 00:28:01,791
Kartik, you are not interested
in what I am saying, right?

445
00:28:01,864 --> 00:28:02,846
Go on. I am listening.

446
00:28:02,953 --> 00:28:04,262
Kartik, no.

447
00:28:05,064 --> 00:28:06,406
Kartik.

448
00:28:07,561 --> 00:28:08,805
Stop it, Kartik.

449
00:28:09,481 --> 00:28:11,848
What the hell! I didn't
do it purposely.

450
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,506
You witch! Kartik.

451
00:28:14,536 --> 00:28:15,780
Listen, Kartik.

452
00:28:16,008 --> 00:28:17,601
''I need to take that step.''

453
00:28:27,016 --> 00:28:29,438
When he had to puke, why
did he drink so much?

454
00:28:30,089 --> 00:28:31,430
Wasted it.

455
00:28:31,624 --> 00:28:33,446
You know how much
that beer cost?

456
00:28:33,544 --> 00:28:35,551
Freaking 300 bucks per bottle.

457
00:28:39,112 --> 00:28:40,290
Are you okay?

458
00:28:43,048 --> 00:28:45,863
Chill, babes. He is a desperate guy.
He won't go anywhere.

459
00:28:45,928 --> 00:28:48,067
He is desperate. That's
why he will go away.

460
00:28:48,136 --> 00:28:50,275
He can sleep with
any girl he wants.

461
00:28:50,632 --> 00:28:52,258
Come on. He is not that hot.

462
00:28:52,488 --> 00:28:55,157
He is. Even you are not
responding to his heat.

463
00:28:55,464 --> 00:28:56,871
Shut up,Anu.

464
00:29:44,328 --> 00:29:45,277
Come.

465
00:29:47,784 --> 00:29:49,311
Where are you coming from?

466
00:29:49,704 --> 00:29:51,199
Group studies.

467
00:29:52,008 --> 00:29:53,918
I was studying at
Tanisha's house.

468
00:29:55,273 --> 00:29:56,385
Come here.

469
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,415
You were studying?

470
00:30:10,729 --> 00:30:12,103
Or drinking?

471
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:13,221
Come on.

472
00:30:27,624 --> 00:30:28,671
Go to hell.

473
00:30:41,576 --> 00:30:44,871
Apply it a bit. Just a bit.

474
00:30:46,792 --> 00:30:49,640
Why do you do this?
You know, don't you?

475
00:30:49,833 --> 00:30:51,491
He doesn't like this.

476
00:30:51,848 --> 00:30:53,856
He doesn't like anything.

477
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,157
Apply a bit. Enough. lt's done.

478
00:30:58,568 --> 00:30:59,616
Go to sleep.

479
00:31:00,232 --> 00:31:01,280
Will you eat something?

480
00:31:01,736 --> 00:31:03,297
I already had a lot.

481
00:31:41,416 --> 00:31:44,515
Finance minister sure
of 9% growth in GDP.

482
00:31:45,096 --> 00:31:47,617
Another farmer suicide
in Maharashtra.

483
00:31:48,584 --> 00:31:50,919
lndian batting failed again.

484
00:31:52,137 --> 00:31:55,137
Goa, Kerala best states in
which to be born in lndia.

485
00:31:57,736 --> 00:31:59,679
Newspaper reading...

486
00:32:01,033 --> 00:32:02,374
...is a must.

487
00:32:02,472 --> 00:32:04,676
lt will not only
increase your GK..

488
00:32:05,929 --> 00:32:07,652
..but also improve
your language.

489
00:32:08,136 --> 00:32:11,966
And you will understand
life in a better way.

490
00:32:12,168 --> 00:32:15,234
But dad, even on the TV..
Not on TV. Not on TV.

491
00:32:15,912 --> 00:32:17,156
Reading. Reading.

492
00:32:18,792 --> 00:32:20,996
To become IAS..

493
00:32:25,033 --> 00:32:26,975
Show me.

494
00:32:33,736 --> 00:32:36,671
Drinking at night and
dancing in the disco.

495
00:32:36,713 --> 00:32:38,917
All this isn't for you.

496
00:32:40,712 --> 00:32:44,640
There are billionaires' and
politicians' sons for that.

497
00:32:44,808 --> 00:32:47,142
Even if they commit
murder, nothing happens.

498
00:32:47,432 --> 00:32:50,498
You don't have to be a
spoil brat like them.

499
00:32:50,761 --> 00:32:52,517
You have to become IAS.

500
00:32:58,281 --> 00:32:59,229
Hey!

501
00:33:01,161 --> 00:33:02,022
Here.

502
00:33:06,792 --> 00:33:07,621
Eat.

503
00:33:11,592 --> 00:33:13,414
What did you drink last night?

504
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:21,021
36yearold handsome
and rich bachelor.

505
00:33:21,192 --> 00:33:24,062
Looking for a soul mate.
Sounds nice.

506
00:33:24,264 --> 00:33:25,213
Show me.

507
00:33:28,872 --> 00:33:32,669
Yes. By now he must be
married and having kids.

508
00:33:32,904 --> 00:33:34,497
lt's two years old newspaper.

509
00:33:34,536 --> 00:33:36,478
Shall I bring this Sunday's newspaper?
Shall I hit you?

510
00:33:37,993 --> 00:33:38,941
Will he do?

511
00:33:42,601 --> 00:33:43,495
Shutup.

512
00:33:45,673 --> 00:33:46,655
Thank you.

513
00:33:48,361 --> 00:33:49,921
Are you comfortable here?

514
00:33:50,121 --> 00:33:52,804
Absolutely. This place
is just perfect.

515
00:33:57,864 --> 00:34:00,417
So Tanisha, do you like reading?

516
00:34:00,808 --> 00:34:01,921
One minute please.

517
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,553
Hello. Hi.

518
00:34:03,688 --> 00:34:07,103
I love reading. And I would
love to read your book.

519
00:34:07,401 --> 00:34:11,329
After me and my editor,you will
be the first person to read it.

520
00:34:11,593 --> 00:34:12,869
'To Kill A Mockingbird'.

521
00:34:13,224 --> 00:34:14,751
No. I didn't read it.

522
00:34:18,313 --> 00:34:19,938
Okay, Vikram.Tell me.

523
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,629
How did you become a writer?

524
00:34:24,456 --> 00:34:25,601
I had nothing else to do.

525
00:34:25,672 --> 00:34:26,654
You always knew?

526
00:34:26,728 --> 00:34:30,209
I always knew that I was too
lazy to do anything else.

527
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:31,997
You are kidding?

528
00:34:32,136 --> 00:34:32,998
No, I am not.

529
00:34:33,129 --> 00:34:36,064
I mean, you also
have to toil a lot.

530
00:34:37,192 --> 00:34:41,949
Yes. But I didn’t know that
before I became a writer.

531
00:34:49,704 --> 00:34:51,460
Hey! What happened?

532
00:34:52,232 --> 00:34:55,101
Nothing. I slipped
in the bathroom.

533
00:34:55,657 --> 00:34:56,453
So..

534
00:34:56,553 --> 00:34:58,079
Who beat you?

535
00:34:58,248 --> 00:34:59,525
He slipped. Oh!

536
00:35:00,009 --> 00:35:03,271
He didn't slip. Uncle beat him.

537
00:35:03,624 --> 00:35:05,086
He didn't let the
entire sector sleep.

538
00:35:05,161 --> 00:35:07,201
Uncle thrashed him very badly.

539
00:35:11,656 --> 00:35:12,518
Kartik.

540
00:35:13,576 --> 00:35:15,202
And who is that witch?

541
00:35:15,272 --> 00:35:16,450
We are not talking.

542
00:35:16,521 --> 00:35:18,376
Because of day before
yesterday night?

543
00:35:18,728 --> 00:35:21,216
Poor guy. You wasted his
efforts of so many days.

544
00:35:21,288 --> 00:35:22,979
Poor guy is bound to be angry.

545
00:35:23,016 --> 00:35:25,089
Shut up.You are
my friend or his?

546
00:35:25,128 --> 00:35:26,273
Come on. Grow up, babes.

547
00:35:26,344 --> 00:35:28,766
Boys are like that.
That's how boys are.

548
00:35:28,872 --> 00:35:30,214
They only want one thing.

549
00:35:30,504 --> 00:35:32,031
Girls also want that one thing.

550
00:35:32,616 --> 00:35:34,755
Then why don't you
want that one thing?

551
00:35:34,857 --> 00:35:36,580
Come on. Not like that.

552
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,168
lt's not a sin. You
are not Mother Mary.

553
00:35:39,272 --> 00:35:41,727
Dear, it's not that. lt's just
that first time should be special.

554
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:44,065
Forget it, babes. There's
nothing special about it.

555
00:35:44,136 --> 00:35:45,314
lt's just hormones.

556
00:35:45,417 --> 00:35:47,806
Sex is the most overrated
thing in this world.

557
00:35:47,976 --> 00:35:50,180
Come on. Please don't spoil for me.
Really.

558
00:35:51,624 --> 00:35:53,567
What do you say? Shall I go? Go.

559
00:36:07,368 --> 00:36:08,066
Kartik.

560
00:36:10,281 --> 00:36:11,328
Wait.

561
00:36:11,816 --> 00:36:13,987
I know you are angry.
I sent you an SMS.

562
00:36:14,025 --> 00:36:15,552
And l wrote on your wall too.

563
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,095
l told you l am sorry.

564
00:36:17,193 --> 00:36:18,818
l think l need a break.

565
00:36:19,017 --> 00:36:20,446
Why are you being so stubborn?

566
00:36:20,552 --> 00:36:21,959
ls that the onlything
between us?

567
00:36:21,993 --> 00:36:23,716
There is nothing between us.

568
00:36:23,817 --> 00:36:25,442
Kartik, listen.

569
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:27,648
lt's over.

570
00:36:46,953 --> 00:36:51,175
''Tears roll down fair cheeks.''

571
00:36:51,369 --> 00:36:55,157
''There is no control
over my breaths.''

572
00:36:55,528 --> 00:36:59,652
''lt's paining although
l am not hurt.''

573
00:36:59,849 --> 00:37:04,071
''On my mind and heart.''

574
00:37:05,801 --> 00:37:07,110
''Quarrels.''

575
00:37:09,928 --> 00:37:11,717
''Quarrels.''

576
00:37:13,801 --> 00:37:16,190
Have Kartik and Nidhi broken up?

577
00:37:16,329 --> 00:37:18,238
l haven't seen them
together since a long time.

578
00:37:18,312 --> 00:37:20,865
Witch. She must have dumped him.

579
00:37:21,161 --> 00:37:24,008
Kartik has dumped her. She
wasn't doing it with him.

580
00:37:31,625 --> 00:37:35,683
''Bad habits play new ruses.''

581
00:37:35,848 --> 00:37:39,907
''All efforts were in vain.''

582
00:37:40,104 --> 00:37:44,228
''Bad habits play new ruses.''

583
00:37:44,296 --> 00:37:48,071
''All efforts were in vain.''

584
00:37:48,553 --> 00:37:52,644
''Heart is envious needlessly.''

585
00:37:52,745 --> 00:37:55,157
''On my mind and heart.''

586
00:37:58,665 --> 00:38:00,356
''Quarrels.''

587
00:38:03,016 --> 00:38:04,576
''Quarrels.''

588
00:38:07,176 --> 00:38:08,802
''Quarrels.''

589
00:38:11,368 --> 00:38:12,743
''Quarrels.''

590
00:38:18,024 --> 00:38:21,188
ln a process. And one
leads to another.

591
00:38:21,353 --> 00:38:22,335
Tanisha.

592
00:38:22,505 --> 00:38:24,065
Did you read the book
that l gave you?

593
00:38:24,169 --> 00:38:25,991
Yup. But l didn't finish it.

594
00:38:26,568 --> 00:38:29,219
l think you should. lt's a
great piece of literature.

595
00:38:29,256 --> 00:38:31,111
They are talking
about relations.

596
00:38:31,145 --> 00:38:33,349
But all black characters
are stereotypical.

597
00:38:33,448 --> 00:38:36,034
l think it'sa melodramatic,
overhyped book.

598
00:38:36,136 --> 00:38:37,184
But thanks, anyway.

599
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:41,542
What can we say?

600
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:45,732
''Life seems very short.''

601
00:38:45,864 --> 00:38:49,508
''All dreams l
have to fulfill.''

602
00:38:50,089 --> 00:38:54,212
''Life seems very short.''

603
00:38:54,312 --> 00:38:55,157
''All dreams l
have to fulfill.''

604
00:38:58,408 --> 00:39:02,183
''Time is passing without
doing anything.''

605
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:06,470
''On my mind and heart.''

606
00:39:07,369 --> 00:39:10,238
There are so many people.
''Quarrels.''

607
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:14,499
''Quarrels.''

608
00:39:17,225 --> 00:39:19,745
''Quarrels.'' Nidhi,
pass me the ties.

609
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,302
Nidhi, pass me the ties.
''Quarrels.''

610
00:39:24,584 --> 00:39:26,013
Sister, papa's ties.

611
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:33,527
Rahul, get my mobile from outside.
Okay, dad.

612
00:39:36,697 --> 00:39:40,079
Nidhi, are you okay? Yes, papa.

613
00:39:40,873 --> 00:39:43,011
You can tell me. What happened?

614
00:39:43,688 --> 00:39:44,736
Any problem in school?

615
00:39:45,129 --> 00:39:48,741
lt's okay if you fail. Don't
take too much pressure.

616
00:39:50,696 --> 00:39:51,906
No, dad.

617
00:39:52,772 --> 00:39:53,917
Boyfriend troubles?

618
00:39:54,409 --> 00:39:55,157
Please, dad.

619
00:39:59,144 --> 00:40:00,355
lt's okay?

620
00:40:01,416 --> 00:40:03,074
Don't trouble your mama at all.
Okay?

621
00:40:03,144 --> 00:40:04,322
Okay, dad. Don't
do any mischief.

622
00:40:04,392 --> 00:40:05,953
Bye, dad. What happened?

623
00:40:06,345 --> 00:40:08,036
lf there is any problem, call me up.
Fine?

624
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:09,795
lt will remain a
secret between us.

625
00:40:11,145 --> 00:40:12,933
Bye. Bye.

626
00:40:15,368 --> 00:40:16,775
l think he is a virgin.

627
00:40:16,809 --> 00:40:18,751
Maybe he was waiting
for me all this while.

628
00:40:18,856 --> 00:40:20,831
He can talk about
anything in this world.

629
00:40:21,477 --> 00:40:22,939
He is so intelligent.You know?

630
00:40:23,144 --> 00:40:24,519
He is what l call a man.

631
00:40:29,864 --> 00:40:31,937
What is this? Okay.
l will leave now.

632
00:40:31,976 --> 00:40:33,318
Neelu ma'am had called.

633
00:40:34,815 --> 00:40:36,822
Are you coming? No.You go.

634
00:40:36,872 --> 00:40:37,919
Okay. Bye.

635
00:40:39,496 --> 00:40:40,259
Hi.

636
00:40:42,457 --> 00:40:44,726
Nowadays Kartik is not
to be seen with you.

637
00:40:45,075 --> 00:40:46,569
Any problem?

638
00:40:46,716 --> 00:40:48,375
Go wax your *** legs,witch.

639
00:40:48,425 --> 00:40:50,530
Chill, babe. l am asking
just as a friend.

640
00:40:50,601 --> 00:40:53,219
Look, we all knew he
is too good for you.

641
00:40:54,281 --> 00:40:54,946
You..

642
00:40:56,936 --> 00:40:57,950
Leave! Yeah!

643
00:41:06,856 --> 00:41:08,383
Hi, Kartik. Hi.

644
00:41:08,489 --> 00:41:11,074
Listen, l don'twant
to talk about her.

645
00:41:11,389 --> 00:41:14,455
Dude, you were never
interested in talking.

646
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:16,852
You were just
interested in screwing.

647
00:41:17,174 --> 00:41:19,083
Don't say that to me.
l am not Nidhi.

648
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:23,432
Nidhi is accepting her mistake.

649
00:41:23,805 --> 00:41:24,982
She has sent you?

650
00:41:25,386 --> 00:41:26,248
No.

651
00:41:28,923 --> 00:41:30,646
What's the hurry?

652
00:41:31,132 --> 00:41:32,855
Understand her
point of view too.

653
00:41:33,565 --> 00:41:35,223
You do not understand
her at all.

654
00:41:35,457 --> 00:41:38,326
l need sex and l am willing
to give up on love for it.

655
00:41:38,865 --> 00:41:40,490
Typical guys attitude.

656
00:41:41,311 --> 00:41:43,799
Do you know how
sensitive she is?

657
00:41:45,151 --> 00:41:46,199
Do you really love her?

658
00:41:46,367 --> 00:41:49,084
''Love. Love. Love.''

659
00:41:49,247 --> 00:41:50,971
What do you think?

660
00:41:52,159 --> 00:41:54,581
''Love. Love. Love.''

661
00:41:55,391 --> 00:41:57,595
''Love. Love. Love.''

662
00:41:58,816 --> 00:42:01,085
''Love. Love. Love.''

663
00:42:01,375 --> 00:42:05,980
''We are afraid and yet
we want to love.''

664
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:08,185
''Love. Love. Love.''

665
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:11,258
''Love. Love. Love.''

666
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,935
''Love. Love. Love.''

667
00:42:15,039 --> 00:42:19,512
''We are afraid and yet
we want to love.''

668
00:42:19,647 --> 00:42:21,851
''We don't care about
the outcome.''

669
00:42:22,143 --> 00:42:23,670
''Now there is no fear.''

670
00:42:24,063 --> 00:42:28,952
''Savor it. Savor it.
Savor it.''

671
00:42:29,024 --> 00:42:31,260
''Love. Love. Love.''

672
00:42:32,095 --> 00:42:33,240
''Love. Love. Love.''

673
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:35,831
''Savor it. Savor it.
Savor it.''

674
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:37,943
''Love. Love. Love.''

675
00:42:38,047 --> 00:42:42,008
''Savor it. Savor it.
Savor it now.''

676
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:46,613
''lt's time to love.''

677
00:42:46,816 --> 00:42:49,205
''What is right and
what is wrong?''

678
00:42:49,375 --> 00:42:52,245
''Why to worry about that?''

679
00:42:54,207 --> 00:42:55,157
''Love. Love. Love.''

680
00:42:57,376 --> 00:42:59,677
''Love. Love. Love.''

681
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:03,607
''Love. Love. Love.''

682
00:43:04,383 --> 00:43:07,417
''Love. Love. Love.''

683
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:10,206
''Plunge.''

684
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:14,231
''Plunge.''

685
00:43:14,367 --> 00:43:16,472
''Plunge.''

686
00:43:17,151 --> 00:43:19,420
''Love. Love. Love.''

687
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:22,740
''Love. Love. Love.''

688
00:43:24,096 --> 00:43:27,740
''Plunge and see.''

689
00:43:27,936 --> 00:43:32,158
''Learn to swim.''

690
00:43:33,183 --> 00:43:40,407
''lt's time to fly.''

691
00:43:42,143 --> 00:43:44,314
''What is right and
what is wrong?''

692
00:43:44,703 --> 00:43:47,224
''Why to worry about that?''

693
00:43:48,063 --> 00:43:49,721
Yes, let's go day
after tomorrow.

694
00:43:49,791 --> 00:43:50,555
Yeah. lt will be fun.

695
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:51,637
Hi, dad. Hi, sweetheart.

696
00:43:51,711 --> 00:43:52,856
No, no. l have never been there.

697
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,157
Yes, Anu is here. Here.
Talk to her.

698
00:43:57,248 --> 00:43:58,196
Hi, uncle.

699
00:43:58,656 --> 00:44:01,022
No. Next time. Okay?

700
00:44:01,983 --> 00:44:03,390
Sure. Soon.

701
00:44:04,095 --> 00:44:05,884
Take care. Bye.

702
00:44:06,399 --> 00:44:08,406
Akhil is saying let's go
to Mathura on Sunday.

703
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:10,075
Yes, let's go.

704
00:44:10,176 --> 00:44:12,565
Anu. No, dad. l have
my test on Tuesday.

705
00:44:12,735 --> 00:44:14,393
Pray on my behalf too.

706
00:44:15,071 --> 00:44:17,275
Okay. Tell me. What will
you have for dinner?

707
00:44:17,695 --> 00:44:19,518
Poor Ramesh is
waiting for so long.

708
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:20,728
Potato and cottage cheese.

709
00:44:20,831 --> 00:44:22,490
No, dad. Cottage cheese
is so fattening.

710
00:44:22,656 --> 00:44:24,216
Your cholesterol will rise.

711
00:44:24,607 --> 00:44:27,477
Corn peas. Not a bad idea.
Alright.

712
00:44:31,999 --> 00:44:33,974
We did it. At his
friend's farmhouse.

713
00:44:34,015 --> 00:44:35,510
Yeah. Hold on. Wait a minute.

714
00:44:37,056 --> 00:44:38,397
Wow! How was it?

715
00:44:38,528 --> 00:44:40,895
Good. But he messed
up really soon.

716
00:44:41,791 --> 00:44:44,825
Oh my God! Anyway, l am
really happy for you.

717
00:44:45,151 --> 00:44:46,099
l know it was you.

718
00:44:46,208 --> 00:44:48,215
Kartik told me.

719
00:44:48,287 --> 00:44:49,847
l didn't want to.

720
00:44:49,951 --> 00:44:51,380
But as long as you
lost your virginity.

721
00:44:51,487 --> 00:44:52,894
Anything for a good cause.

722
00:44:53,759 --> 00:44:55,157
Okay. Now hang up. Today
mom and dad are at home.

723
00:44:56,768 --> 00:44:59,997
l need to spend some time with them.
Take care.

724
00:45:00,127 --> 00:45:01,469
Happy anniversary of virginity.

725
00:45:02,047 --> 00:45:03,574
Okay. Bye. Bye.

726
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:08,472
13 marks?

727
00:45:09,663 --> 00:45:11,965
That's why l have enrolled you
in such an expensive school?

728
00:45:13,792 --> 00:45:15,701
You came first in 8th standard.
You got a cup.

729
00:45:15,775 --> 00:45:17,302
And you won the battle of life.

730
00:45:18,592 --> 00:45:20,021
ls this how you
will do your lES?

731
00:45:22,143 --> 00:45:25,591
lf you don't want to study, l
will send you to a mechanic shop.

732
00:45:26,335 --> 00:45:28,855
Mr. Sinha's son is
an all lndia topper.

733
00:45:30,303 --> 00:45:32,027
Competition has become so tough.

734
00:45:34,687 --> 00:45:37,884
With these marks you won't get
admission even in a lousy college.

735
00:45:42,879 --> 00:45:43,610
What is it?

736
00:45:44,127 --> 00:45:45,054
Leave.

737
00:45:46,432 --> 00:45:47,097
Leave.

738
00:45:54,175 --> 00:45:54,840
Say something.

739
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:07,254
Serve dinner.

740
00:46:13,439 --> 00:46:16,406
Look, Tanisha. l don't think
it's working out for me.

741
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,189
l really like you. You
are a wonderful person.

742
00:46:19,295 --> 00:46:21,205
But...something is missing.

743
00:46:21,567 --> 00:46:22,549
What is missing?

744
00:46:23,103 --> 00:46:25,722
l mean, am l not
intelligent enough?

745
00:46:25,983 --> 00:46:27,161
Am l not goodlooking?

746
00:46:27,263 --> 00:46:28,604
We are not compatible.

747
00:46:28,991 --> 00:46:30,617
Compatible meaning how?

748
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:33,661
See,you are still in school.

749
00:46:34,528 --> 00:46:35,934
And you are not exposed.

750
00:46:36,448 --> 00:46:38,455
Next to next year l am
going to go to college.

751
00:46:38,655 --> 00:46:39,833
There are many other things.

752
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:41,563
What? Tell me.

753
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:45,502
Look, we had gone to Habitat
centre to watch a film.

754
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:47,383
And you were talking.

755
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,113
Either you wanted
to kiss or talk.

756
00:46:49,311 --> 00:46:51,318
l thought you also
wanted to kiss.

757
00:46:51,743 --> 00:46:54,110
l mean, l couldn't
understand that film.

758
00:46:54,527 --> 00:46:55,157
And l was asking you
about the film only.

759
00:46:56,543 --> 00:46:58,037
l wasn't criticizing someone.

760
00:46:58,080 --> 00:46:59,770
Our music taste is
also very different.

761
00:47:00,383 --> 00:47:01,561
You put on your
headphone and listen.

762
00:47:01,727 --> 00:47:03,188
l will put on my
headphone and listen.

763
00:47:03,743 --> 00:47:04,691
What's the big deal?

764
00:47:05,023 --> 00:47:07,511
You don't understand. We are
not right for each other.

765
00:47:08,447 --> 00:47:09,821
Can we talk about this?

766
00:47:10,208 --> 00:47:12,412
Tanisha, l really like you.

767
00:47:14,815 --> 00:47:16,538
l wanted to fall
in love with you.

768
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:19,096
But you are not the
perfect person.

769
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:24,665
But no one is perfect,
right, Sameer?

770
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:27,742
l knew.You won't understand.

771
00:47:44,831 --> 00:47:45,813
You have light?

772
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:50,711
You need light or space?

773
00:47:58,079 --> 00:47:59,453
Upset about something?

774
00:48:02,239 --> 00:48:03,734
Love and all that.

775
00:48:07,775 --> 00:48:08,724
First crush.

776
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:11,415
Hello. l am 16.

777
00:48:17,471 --> 00:48:18,365
Sorry.

778
00:48:22,879 --> 00:48:24,701
Can someone be perfect?

779
00:48:28,255 --> 00:48:29,782
l haven't seen a perfect person.

780
00:48:32,063 --> 00:48:34,364
But you have also not
seen the whole world.

781
00:48:38,335 --> 00:48:40,724
There are more things in
heaven and earth, Horatio..

782
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:43,028
..than are dreamt of
in your philosophy.

783
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:44,861
That's.. Hamlet.

784
00:48:46,304 --> 00:48:47,351
l know.

785
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:53,939
Don't worry.

786
00:48:55,487 --> 00:48:56,764
You will find someone special.

787
00:48:57,279 --> 00:48:58,806
l found him with such
great difficulty.

788
00:49:07,263 --> 00:49:09,151
What kind of music do you like?

789
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:14,995
l like music.. Have you
ever dumped someone..

790
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:18,648
..just because your taste
in music is different?

791
00:49:21,376 --> 00:49:22,324
Got to go.

792
00:49:22,815 --> 00:49:23,862
Thanks for listening.

793
00:49:35,968 --> 00:49:37,790
lt's good, dear.
Having fun today.

794
00:49:38,879 --> 00:49:41,629
Shall l make it?
Who will eat then?

795
00:49:41,759 --> 00:49:43,581
Shut up. Kartik can cook.

796
00:49:43,871 --> 00:49:45,562
lf he messes up, only
you will eat it.

797
00:49:45,695 --> 00:49:47,899
He will cook good.
Kartik can do anything.

798
00:49:50,783 --> 00:49:52,092
Don't get me into trouble.

799
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:53,272
Just chill.

800
00:49:54,527 --> 00:49:55,157
Hi. Hey.

801
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:57,691
Please come and join
us for the party.

802
00:49:58,719 --> 00:49:59,667
l think l am okay.

803
00:49:59,743 --> 00:50:00,823
l thought you wanted
to be surrounded..

804
00:50:00,895 --> 00:50:02,269
..by the vitality of the city.

805
00:50:04,191 --> 00:50:07,322
Could talent live
at home and thrive.

806
00:50:07,711 --> 00:50:11,159
Could talent live
at home and thrive.

807
00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:14,675
Why should the Badakhshan
ruby wander worldwide?

808
00:50:15,199 --> 00:50:17,588
Albeit in Deccan, Zauq, the
Muse commands respect.

809
00:50:17,887 --> 00:50:21,717
Who would quit the lanes
of Delhi and suffer exile?

810
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:24,605
Wow! Wow! Wow!

811
00:50:25,663 --> 00:50:28,729
There should be a dictator in
our country too. Like Hitler.

812
00:50:29,024 --> 00:50:30,911
He killed more
than 60000 people.

813
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:32,665
l mean, a better version.

814
00:50:32,735 --> 00:50:34,393
Rahul Gandhi is so
cute, isn't he?

815
00:50:34,463 --> 00:50:37,049
Freud was just too
obsessed with sex.

816
00:50:37,151 --> 00:50:38,231
But isn't it true?

817
00:50:38,431 --> 00:50:40,187
Don't we all have the
Oedipus complex?

818
00:50:40,479 --> 00:50:41,243
Gross.

819
00:50:41,343 --> 00:50:43,253
l hate green vegetables.

820
00:50:43,424 --> 00:50:46,326
l know a lot of publishers. l
can introduce you to them.

821
00:50:47,071 --> 00:50:48,696
That will be nice.Thank you.
Yeah.

822
00:50:48,736 --> 00:50:50,623
90% is nothing these days.

823
00:50:50,719 --> 00:50:52,541
You won't even be allowed
to enter good colleges.

824
00:50:52,672 --> 00:50:54,679
You need at least 94%.

825
00:50:55,263 --> 00:50:57,565
lf you don't get it, you
should commit suicide?

826
00:50:57,631 --> 00:50:58,579
Are you mad?

827
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:03,868
Truth or dare?

828
00:51:04,863 --> 00:51:05,811
Truth.

829
00:51:06,208 --> 00:51:09,339
When your first book was a
flop, how did you feel?

830
00:51:09,375 --> 00:51:10,717
Great!

831
00:51:12,031 --> 00:51:13,209
Greatest day of my life.

832
00:51:13,471 --> 00:51:16,089
Yeah. And you thanked your parents
and your teachers. Right?

833
00:51:20,831 --> 00:51:21,594
Dare.

834
00:51:21,887 --> 00:51:23,414
Do a hot dance.

835
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:25,145
Wow!

836
00:51:27,903 --> 00:51:28,851
Come on.

837
00:51:29,215 --> 00:51:30,142
Nice.

838
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:32,219
Yeah.

839
00:51:36,031 --> 00:51:36,696
Dare.

840
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:37,981
Okay.

841
00:51:41,055 --> 00:51:43,226
Do striptease.

842
00:51:44,319 --> 00:51:46,391
Tanu. Aunt, it's just a game.

843
00:51:46,432 --> 00:51:47,544
Or else you do it, aunt.

844
00:52:10,176 --> 00:52:11,158
Okay, guys. l also want to..

845
00:52:11,199 --> 00:52:12,660
See you. So soon? Got to go.

846
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:13,526
What happened? Dad?

847
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:14,363
Yeah.

848
00:52:15,039 --> 00:52:16,348
His dad is very strict.

849
00:52:16,448 --> 00:52:17,724
He is lucky.

850
00:52:17,823 --> 00:52:19,710
l had to reach home
before 8 o'clock.

851
00:52:19,743 --> 00:52:22,077
Seriously. l hated
my dad for it.

852
00:52:23,199 --> 00:52:24,792
But l don't hate him.

853
00:52:25,919 --> 00:52:27,480
Goodnight. Goodnight.

854
00:52:31,327 --> 00:52:32,821
Your PG is hot.

855
00:52:33,216 --> 00:52:35,736
He seems intelligent too. He
is trying to flirt a lot too.

856
00:52:37,535 --> 00:52:39,226
Maybe he is your perfect guy?

857
00:52:39,391 --> 00:52:40,339
He is uncle.

858
00:52:40,544 --> 00:52:42,267
Goodnight. Goodnight.

859
00:53:03,455 --> 00:53:06,684
lndoPaktalks in
Kashmir fail again.

860
00:53:06,847 --> 00:53:09,149
Both nations blame each other.

861
00:53:09,823 --> 00:53:13,751
Obama describes Manmohan Singh
as a wise, wonderful man.

862
00:53:13,888 --> 00:53:16,538
Mob fury kills 3 Dalits.

863
00:53:17,407 --> 00:53:21,182
Latest sex survey reveals that
most lndian married men..

864
00:53:21,216 --> 00:53:23,190
..have sex thrice a week.

865
00:53:25,823 --> 00:53:26,935
Damn!

866
00:53:30,047 --> 00:53:30,996
Here.

867
00:53:34,175 --> 00:53:36,761
Nowadays we can't even let our
children read the newspaper.

868
00:53:38,496 --> 00:53:39,357
Witch.

869
00:53:40,576 --> 00:53:41,721
l hate her.

870
00:53:42,815 --> 00:53:44,342
What do they think
of themselves?

871
00:53:49,056 --> 00:53:50,397
Awesome!

872
00:53:50,783 --> 00:53:53,084
Ask Anu whether she will
do this kind of modeling.

873
00:53:53,663 --> 00:53:55,157
She won't even charge for
this kind of modeling.

874
00:53:58,079 --> 00:53:59,356
Come here.

875
00:54:00,991 --> 00:54:02,616
You don't talk to us.

876
00:54:02,911 --> 00:54:05,366
You always cling to Tanisha.

877
00:54:05,695 --> 00:54:08,150
Do one thing. lnvite
her for the party.

878
00:54:08,256 --> 00:54:11,038
l will pay. But l
will have fun too.

879
00:54:11,167 --> 00:54:13,142
Me too. Me too.

880
00:54:13,439 --> 00:54:17,017
You just dance and
make her ready for me.

881
00:54:25,343 --> 00:54:27,732
Why do you fight when you
don't have the strength?

882
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:29,727
lt's okay. Chill.

883
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:31,484
They are just idiots.

884
00:54:33,216 --> 00:54:34,557
Shall we do one thing? What?

885
00:54:34,943 --> 00:54:36,568
Shall we bunk? When?

886
00:54:48,607 --> 00:54:54,009
''lt's you. lt's only you.''

887
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:55,157
''lt's only you.''

888
00:54:56,608 --> 00:54:59,837
''You are with me.''

889
00:54:59,871 --> 00:55:02,359
''lt's only you.''

890
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:07,672
''lt's only you.''

891
00:55:11,647 --> 00:55:16,830
''You are my God.''

892
00:55:18,463 --> 00:55:21,430
''You are my God.''

893
00:55:22,911 --> 00:55:28,181
''Eco, algebra,
inflation, literature.''

894
00:55:28,671 --> 00:55:31,038
''Questions, problems.''

895
00:55:31,072 --> 00:55:33,919
''This boring labor.''

896
00:55:33,952 --> 00:55:38,654
''This spitting and bunking.''

897
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:42,101
''lt's all fun.''

898
00:55:45,855 --> 00:55:48,244
''lt's only you.''

899
00:55:48,448 --> 00:55:51,098
''lt's only you.''

900
00:55:51,199 --> 00:55:53,882
''lt's only you.''

901
00:55:57,055 --> 00:56:01,211
''You are with me.''

902
00:56:01,343 --> 00:56:03,165
''So everything is good.''

903
00:56:03,231 --> 00:56:05,948
That was fun, man. Let's
do it every week.

904
00:56:06,047 --> 00:56:07,291
We can do it daily too.

905
00:56:07,391 --> 00:56:09,214
We don't have any
other work to do.

906
00:56:09,951 --> 00:56:11,129
Will you eat? What?

907
00:56:11,423 --> 00:56:12,732
Chocolate bar.

908
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:15,927
l don't have money, dear.
lt got over.

909
00:56:16,031 --> 00:56:17,919
Why do you irritate
me time and again?

910
00:56:17,951 --> 00:56:19,861
l asked for icecream,
not for money.

911
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:22,424
Sorry. Chill.

912
00:56:26,623 --> 00:56:27,801
Give me two chocolate bars.

913
00:56:31,359 --> 00:56:32,307
Thanks.

914
00:56:37,343 --> 00:56:38,271
What happened?

915
00:56:38,719 --> 00:56:41,502
What? No. Nothing. So
why aren't you eating?

916
00:56:41,567 --> 00:56:42,549
lsn't it good?

917
00:56:42,911 --> 00:56:44,821
How can chocolate
bar not be good?

918
00:56:45,248 --> 00:56:49,470
Tanisha, l want to talk to you.
Yes?

919
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:53,977
The other day l was asking
you on the phone. What?

920
00:56:54,175 --> 00:56:55,157
'Jaane Tu'film.

921
00:56:56,991 --> 00:56:59,195
lt was okay. But lmran was cute.

922
00:56:59,392 --> 00:57:01,595
Tanisha, wait a minute.

923
00:57:01,791 --> 00:57:02,652
Tell me.

924
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:08,022
Look,what l was saying is that
you and l are also good friends.

925
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:09,589
So...

00:57:21,183 --> 00:57:23,387
l love you. l love you too.

930
00:57:24,352 --> 00:57:27,221
Not friendly l love you.

l am talking about
real l love you.

932
00:57:31,424 --> 00:57:34,206
Man,this is the
problem with boys.

933
00:57:34,431 --> 00:57:36,820
Why do you always think
in the same direction?

934
00:57:37,375 --> 00:57:39,099
Look, we are best friends. Okay?

935
00:57:39,199 --> 00:57:41,621
And l love you. l
really love you a lot.

936
00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:45,047
But l can't think of
you in that sense.

937
00:57:45,439 --> 00:57:46,999
Hope you understand. Okay?

938
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:49,945
And please stop watching
romantic movies.

939
00:57:50,143 --> 00:57:51,769
Watch good movies.

940
00:57:53,408 --> 00:57:55,157
Tanish, l am sorry. Shut up.

941
00:57:57,344 --> 00:57:59,198
You don't need to say sorry.
Okay?

942
00:57:59,391 --> 00:58:01,115
lt's okay. lt happens.

943
00:58:01,184 --> 00:58:03,420
We are still bestf riends.
Right?

944
00:58:04,479 --> 00:58:06,366
See you in school tomorrow. Bye.

945
00:59:16,255 --> 00:59:17,433
How was the date?

946
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:20,057
He proposed to me.

947
00:59:20,319 --> 00:59:22,326
Finally! l told you so.

948
00:59:22,367 --> 00:59:24,636
Shut up. So are you
guys going around now?

949
00:59:24,671 --> 00:59:27,159
Are you crazy? l refused.

950
00:59:27,807 --> 00:59:30,938
The guy you don't love is always
the one who proposes you.

951
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:06,452
Hey!

952
01:00:07,808 --> 01:00:09,052
What are you doing here?

953
01:00:14,528 --> 01:00:16,316
You have come on top
to relieve yourself?

954
01:00:17,408 --> 01:00:18,837
Will you drench Delhi?

955
01:00:52,159 --> 01:00:53,207
Come.

956
01:00:58,548 --> 01:00:59,595
What is this?

957
01:01:01,692 --> 01:01:03,602
Your father is asking
you, what is this?

958
01:01:06,696 --> 01:01:08,420
Since when have you
been studying this?

959
01:01:11,264 --> 01:01:12,409
Since when?

960
01:01:13,567 --> 01:01:16,218
ls this what you are studying?
Let it be.

961
01:01:16,255 --> 01:01:18,328
l.. Go out. Go out.

962
01:01:18,367 --> 01:01:19,644
Come on.

963
01:01:20,223 --> 01:01:21,565
Since when is this going on?

964
01:01:21,728 --> 01:01:23,866
What is this? Say something.

965
01:07:09,297 --> 01:07:11,915
Yes, Anu. What?

966
01:07:12,401 --> 01:07:14,987
What happened? Ashwin
killed his dad. What?

967
01:07:16,401 --> 01:07:18,889
The boy has guts. Hats off.
That's true.

968
01:07:18,993 --> 01:07:21,131
Where is Tanisha? Don't know.
l guess she went that way.

969
01:07:21,201 --> 01:07:22,510
What happened? What has he done?

970
01:07:22,545 --> 01:07:23,854
Don't know. He just disappeared.

971
01:07:23,889 --> 01:07:24,751
He is nowhere to be found.

972
01:07:24,817 --> 01:07:26,824
He did all this because of me.

973
01:07:26,961 --> 01:07:31,184
l could see it in his eyes. He
was completely broken hearted.

974
01:07:32,305 --> 01:07:34,345
l even tried his
phone last night.

975
01:07:34,513 --> 01:07:36,269
But nobody picked up.

976
01:07:36,817 --> 01:07:40,014
He loved me.And l ruined him.

977
01:07:54,833 --> 01:07:55,157
How can anyone kill his own dad?

978
01:07:57,297 --> 01:07:58,573
A father is a father after all.

979
01:07:59,249 --> 01:08:00,875
Maybe his father deserved it.

980
01:08:01,169 --> 01:08:04,203
Shut up. Whatever.
He has sired him.

981
01:08:04,721 --> 01:08:06,247
You read so many times.

982
01:08:06,545 --> 01:08:08,072
Father rapes his daughter.

983
01:08:08,433 --> 01:08:11,532
l don't believe it. How can
anyone do so to his family?

984
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:13,350
They do.

985
01:08:14,609 --> 01:08:17,773
One of my cousins. He
tried it on me. Who?

986
01:08:18,737 --> 01:08:21,104
Forget it. l still
consider him my brother.

987
01:08:21,201 --> 01:08:23,110
Will you guys please shut up?

988
01:08:28,145 --> 01:08:29,323
Hello.

989
01:08:31,025 --> 01:08:32,007
Hello.

990
01:08:39,633 --> 01:08:40,526
Hello.

991
01:08:41,393 --> 01:08:43,216
l got a call from your number.

992
01:08:44,945 --> 01:08:46,286
To which place does
this number belong to?

993
01:08:48,401 --> 01:08:49,830
Okay.

994
01:08:52,977 --> 01:08:54,024
Who was it?

995
01:08:54,225 --> 01:08:55,157
Aunt, l got a missed call from
New Delhi railway station.

996
01:08:57,137 --> 01:08:58,566
We are going there. Okay.

997
01:08:58,641 --> 01:09:00,877
Take care. I'll take them.
I'll take them.

998
01:09:27,857 --> 01:09:29,199
So tell me,Tanisha.

999
01:09:30,225 --> 01:09:31,272
Do you love him?

1000
01:09:31,985 --> 01:09:33,032
lwish l did.

1001
01:09:34,289 --> 01:09:36,177
Maybe, he hasn't
committed the murder.

1002
01:09:36,209 --> 01:09:37,224
So why is he on the run?

1003
01:09:37,425 --> 01:09:38,800
The police must be
implicating him.

1004
01:09:38,897 --> 01:09:41,931
Yes, it is so common. l
know he has done it.

1005
01:09:43,089 --> 01:09:45,545
You just need an
excuse to feel guilty.

1006
01:09:45,841 --> 01:09:48,296
Stop acting like the most
important girl in the world.

1007
01:09:48,625 --> 01:09:49,738
That is me.

1008
01:09:50,929 --> 01:09:52,619
Karthik says so.

1009
01:09:53,105 --> 01:09:54,512
Will you ever grow up?

1010
01:09:55,281 --> 01:09:58,030
Ashwin grew up overnight.

1011
01:09:58,417 --> 01:10:01,134
All of us have grown up.
Except Nidhi.

1012
01:10:01,297 --> 01:10:03,566
Hello. l am very mature.

1013
01:10:03,793 --> 01:10:05,997
Really? You tell me. Has
she said anything mature..

1014
01:10:06,065 --> 01:10:07,439
..in all this while?

1015
01:10:07,601 --> 01:10:09,357
As if you people have.

1016
01:10:09,457 --> 01:10:12,491
'The second over. He put a
towel in his trousers.'

1017
01:10:12,529 --> 01:10:16,359
He wasin your class, right?
Did you know him?

1018
01:10:17,009 --> 01:10:18,383
Of course, he was in my class.

1019
01:10:18,481 --> 01:10:22,310
l mean was he your friend.
He was.

1020
01:10:23,281 --> 01:10:25,223
Did he fight in school as well?

1021
01:10:25,393 --> 01:10:27,116
Did he ever threaten you?

1022
01:10:28,881 --> 01:10:30,855
His dad used to beat
him all the time.

1023
01:10:30,897 --> 01:10:32,522
He would harass
him all the time.

1024
01:10:32,689 --> 01:10:35,471
So he used to beat him
for his own good, right?

1025
01:10:35,697 --> 01:10:38,631
Now that doesn't mean you
kill your own father.

1026
01:10:40,689 --> 01:10:42,959
lndia has become America now.

1027
01:10:43,249 --> 01:10:45,933
l mean you can't tell
anything to your kids either.

1028
01:10:47,153 --> 01:10:50,055
Mom, you harass sister a lot.

1029
01:10:51,633 --> 01:10:53,608
Go. Go and study.

1030
01:10:56,625 --> 01:10:59,308
'Ravi Shankar Jha'swife Nirja Jha
has confessed to her crime..'

1031
01:10:59,409 --> 01:11:00,521
'..in Ravi Shankar murder case.'

1032
01:11:00,721 --> 01:11:04,103
But the police thinks that she
is doing so to save her son..

1033
01:11:04,177 --> 01:11:05,290
..Ashwin Jha.

1034
01:11:05,457 --> 01:11:07,366
Ashwin Jha has been missing
the night of the murder.

1035
01:11:52,657 --> 01:11:54,828
The jacket seems nice.

1036
01:11:57,745 --> 01:11:59,119
lt will look better on us.

1037
01:11:59,857 --> 01:12:00,839
Come on.Take it off.

1038
01:12:08,241 --> 01:12:09,703
Whom have you murdered?

1039
01:12:20,945 --> 01:12:22,286
'l am standing here in
Ashwin Jha's neighbourhood.'

1040
01:12:22,385 --> 01:12:24,076
'Here criminals are active.'

1041
01:12:25,681 --> 01:12:29,675
'When an ordinaryman steals
the brain of a sharp person?'

1042
01:12:29,713 --> 01:12:33,358
Ashwin Jha. Where
did you find him?

1043
01:12:33,425 --> 01:12:35,563
Pandey,get some tea.

1044
01:12:36,593 --> 01:12:38,448
Brother, you are all
over the television.

1045
01:12:38,609 --> 01:12:42,057
'According to the feed just received,
a 60 year elderly man's...'

1046
01:12:42,161 --> 01:12:43,088
Sit.

1047
01:12:43,217 --> 01:12:44,941
'Dead body has been found.'

1048
01:12:46,641 --> 01:12:48,616
'This news is shocking.' Sit.

We are creating a gang. Join us.

1050
01:13:03,025 --> 01:13:05,927
We'll share what we earn.

1051
01:13:07,185 --> 01:13:08,330
Partnership.

1052
01:13:12,849 --> 01:13:13,776
Yes.

1053
01:13:17,809 --> 01:13:21,639
Brother,this address...
Hey. Stop.

1054
01:13:22,321 --> 01:13:23,150
My cell phone.

Move it. Move it.

1056
01:13:24,433 --> 01:13:26,921
Stop. Stop. Someone catch him.

1057
01:13:27,121 --> 01:13:29,194
l have got a phone for you.
Thank you.

1058

She's Babita's friend.

1064
01:13:50,129 --> 01:13:52,038
She's looking for a
boyfriend from a big city.

1065
01:13:52,337 --> 01:13:53,832
lf you say, shall
l speak to her?

1066
01:13:54,353 --> 01:13:55,157
Why? Do you have
a girl in Delhi?

1067
01:14:01,457 --> 01:14:05,450
Look, l took your picture. When
you were going to the market...

1068
01:14:22,065 --> 01:14:25,065
l did it. l am looking good.

This is no way to talk.
This is not the way, dear.

1208
01:24:22,257 --> 01:24:23,980
Why the hell are you
guys acting like that..

1210
01:24:26,769 --> 01:24:28,656
Dear. Listen to me.

1211
01:24:29,233 --> 01:24:31,753
Dear, your dad told
me about last night.

1212
01:24:31,953 --> 01:24:33,479
What did he tell you?

1213
01:24:33,745 --> 01:24:35,600
That he was with Saloni.

1214
01:24:36,273 --> 01:24:38,183
Mom, they were kissing.

1215
01:24:39,441 --> 01:24:42,310
Look dear. Listen to
me very calmly now.

1216
01:24:42,577 --> 01:24:45,195
You know Akhil uncle?
Your friend. Why?

1217
01:24:47,313 --> 01:24:49,200
He is not just my friend.

1218
01:24:50,449 --> 01:24:52,303
We are in a relationship.

1219
01:24:54,801 --> 01:24:55,157
See,your dad and l had
an open marriage..

1220
01:24:56,881 --> 01:24:59,499
..ever since you
were very young.

1221
01:25:00,273 --> 01:25:01,680
But we cared for you.

1222
01:25:02,801 --> 01:25:04,743
We never wanted to
hurt you, dear.

1223
01:25:05,713 --> 01:25:08,909
Just try and understand.
Don't take us wrong.

1224
01:25:23,729 --> 01:25:24,493
Anu.

1225
01:25:24,881 --> 01:25:25,710

1227
01:25:27,377 --> 01:25:28,141
Anu.

01:25:28,209 --> 01:25:30,445
Dear, are you alright?
Dear, please.

1229
01:25:33,169 --> 01:25:34,347
This is Ballimaran.

1230
01:25:37,201 --> 01:25:39,023
And that used to be our house.

1231
01:25:41,041 --> 01:25:43,016
Had l been born 150 years ago..

1232
01:25:43,441 --> 01:25:44,718
..Galib would have
been my neighbor.

1233
01:25:45,585 --> 01:25:46,632
Really. Really?

1234
01:25:46,705 --> 01:25:47,752
l will show you.

1235
01:26:08,049 --> 01:26:09,391
That's my school.

1236
01:26:09,777 --> 01:26:11,271
Oh! Come.

1237
01:26:21,873 --> 01:26:24,361
l used to come here everyday
from Ballimaran on a cycle.

1238
01:26:25,713 --> 01:26:26,695
And she would come on foot.

1239
01:26:27,057 --> 01:26:28,005
A girl?

1240
01:26:28,913 --> 01:26:29,862
Roshni.

1241
01:26:33,713 --> 01:26:35,437
She was a year elder to me.

1242
01:26:38,225 --> 01:26:41,967
And l would follow her
on my cycle everyday.

1243
01:26:42,929 --> 01:26:45,231
Why? She wouldn't give
you any importance?

1244
01:26:45,905 --> 01:26:48,774
She would. She also
wanted me to talk to her.

1245
01:26:49,073 --> 01:26:50,218
l see.And then?

1246
01:26:52,209 --> 01:26:54,152
You know when first
time we fall in love..

1247
01:26:55,857 --> 01:26:57,383
..l was so happy.

1248
01:26:59,793 --> 01:27:02,378
With great difficulty l fixed
a date through her friend.

1249
01:27:04,017 --> 01:27:05,261
We had to meet the next day.

1250
01:27:08,465 --> 01:27:09,807
But she didn't come.

1251
01:27:10,289 --> 01:27:11,183
Why?

1252
01:27:12,113 --> 01:27:14,502
Let it be. Why do you want to know?
Let's go.

1253
01:27:15,185 --> 01:27:16,462
Tell me.

1254
01:27:16,657 --> 01:27:18,479
lt's getting exciting.

1255
01:27:20,465 --> 01:27:22,799
She never came. Why?

1256
01:27:24,337 --> 01:27:26,247
Her dead body was
found after 3 days.

1257
01:27:27,505 --> 01:27:30,287
She was gangraped
and then killed.

1258
01:27:34,385 --> 01:27:35,246
Oh!

1259
01:27:36,689 --> 01:27:38,598
l am so sorry,Vikram.

1260
01:27:42,417 --> 01:27:44,457
Delhi is not a city for women.

1261
01:27:48,625 --> 01:27:49,486
Hey!

1262
01:27:50,257 --> 01:27:51,501
Did you like my story?

1263
01:27:52,273 --> 01:27:54,378
Total Bollywood stuff.
Should l try it in Mumbai?

1264
01:27:55,537 --> 01:27:58,985
You were telling me a story?
Of course.

1265
01:27:59,281 --> 01:28:00,688
And you started crying.

1266
01:28:01,873 --> 01:28:05,135
Delhi is not a city for women.
l am so sorry,Vikram.

1267
01:28:05,713 --> 01:28:07,055
Shut up. Okay?

1268
01:28:07,729 --> 01:28:08,678
What?

1269
01:28:39,313 --> 01:28:42,063
The first time l came
here, dad was with me.

1270
01:28:42,097 --> 01:28:44,486
l cried a lot at the
light and sound show.

1271
01:28:45,041 --> 01:28:46,218
l was not even one year old.

1272
01:28:46,417 --> 01:28:48,042
That's what aunt told me.

1273
01:28:50,513 --> 01:28:53,546
After that, dad passed away.
So..

1274
01:28:53,777 --> 01:28:55,157
Dipti told me...
about that accident.

1275
01:28:59,345 --> 01:29:00,752
lt was entirely my fault.

1276
01:29:02,321 --> 01:29:03,466
My luck is such.

1277
01:29:04,177 --> 01:29:06,282
My first birthday.

1278
01:29:07,089 --> 01:29:09,675
And a day prior to it
this accident took place.

1279
01:29:09,937 --> 01:29:11,596
ls it because of that accident..

1280
01:29:13,233 --> 01:29:14,662
..that you think you are cursed?

1281
01:29:16,497 --> 01:29:17,926
Last night you told me.

1282
01:29:18,673 --> 01:29:19,622
Oh!

1283
01:29:20,721 --> 01:29:22,630
Maybe l was too drunk.

1284
01:29:23,505 --> 01:29:24,453
lt's okay.

1285
01:29:27,249 --> 01:29:28,558
l don't know why..

1286
01:29:30,129 --> 01:29:32,268
..l feel as if someone
is staring at me.

1287
01:29:33,777 --> 01:29:35,850
And whenever something
good is going to happen..

1288
01:29:36,625 --> 01:29:38,151
..he ruins it.

1289
01:29:40,049 --> 01:29:40,845
l know.

1290
01:29:42,257 --> 01:29:43,272
lt happens.

1291
01:29:45,201 --> 01:29:48,463
You feel as if nothing is
ever going to go right.

1292
01:29:49,137 --> 01:29:50,631
But don't blame yourself for it.

1293
01:29:52,401 --> 01:29:54,889
Life has its different
ways of screwing us up.

1294
01:29:56,817 --> 01:29:59,021
Not just you, he is
staring at all of us.

1295
01:30:09,105 --> 01:30:11,494
What happened? How did
you come so early today?

1296
01:30:12,945 --> 01:30:13,894
Just like that.

1297
01:30:14,257 --> 01:30:15,916
l was getting bored at home.

1298
01:30:16,401 --> 01:30:18,189
Don't cry.

1299
01:30:18,705 --> 01:30:22,218
l feel so lonely at times.
There is no one l can talk to.

1300
01:30:22,705 --> 01:30:25,639
Come on. We are best friends.
You can always talk to me.

1301
01:30:27,761 --> 01:30:30,248
Come on. Wipe your face. The
dance class is going to begin.

1302
01:30:30,289 --> 01:30:31,663
Sir must be waiting for you.

1303
01:30:31,761 --> 01:30:33,768
Screw him. He would love that.

1304
01:30:34,737 --> 01:30:36,362
No. l am not in the mood.

1305
01:30:36,465 --> 01:30:37,480
So?

1306
01:30:40,753 --> 01:30:43,087
Then mom said they are
having an open marriage.

1307
01:30:43,185 --> 01:30:44,232
What?

1308
01:30:44,881 --> 01:30:46,637
l was also shocked.

1309
01:30:48,945 --> 01:30:50,832
l am very angry with them.

1310
01:30:51,345 --> 01:30:52,840
l was so proud of them.

1311
01:30:53,265 --> 01:30:55,157
Since childhood you have
an image of your parents.

1312
01:30:56,401 --> 01:30:58,256
They must take care of it.

1313
01:31:01,457 --> 01:31:04,840
Because when that image
breaks, it feels very bad.

1314
01:31:05,329 --> 01:31:06,671
lt hurts.

1315
01:31:07,601 --> 01:31:09,227
You lose your respect for them.

1316
01:31:09,713 --> 01:31:11,142
You actually begin to hate them.

1317
01:31:11,825 --> 01:31:13,352
You are right.

1318
01:31:14,769 --> 01:31:16,711
My dad is super cool.

1319
01:31:17,489 --> 01:31:19,311
And l will never let him down.

1320
01:31:19,377 --> 01:31:22,923
But my mom...Gosh! She
is so embarrassing.

1321
01:31:24,177 --> 01:31:26,414
Thank God forgiving
you a good father.

1322
01:31:26,897 --> 01:31:29,832
Otherwise nowadays you don't
get to see good fathers.

1323
01:31:31,569 --> 01:31:33,609
But you also sleep
around, right?

1324
01:31:34,097 --> 01:31:35,920
My doing it is okay. l am young.

1325
01:31:36,017 --> 01:31:37,424
They are parents, dear.

1326
01:31:37,457 --> 01:31:38,886
They were supposed
to be in love.

1327
01:31:42,161 --> 01:31:43,438
Maybe they are.

1328
01:31:47,377 --> 01:31:48,326
Vikram. Yes.

1329
01:31:48,401 --> 01:31:49,895
Tell me something.

1330
01:31:50,865 --> 01:31:52,688
Why did you bring me with you?

1331
01:31:53,777 --> 01:31:55,157
l enjoy your company.

1332
01:31:56,081 --> 01:31:57,488
ls that the only reason?

1333
01:31:58,705 --> 01:31:59,752
What do you feel?

1334
01:32:01,873 --> 01:32:03,783
You elders are such hypocrites.

1335
01:32:04,177 --> 01:32:05,802
You think we don't
know anything.

1336
01:32:06,065 --> 01:32:07,342
We are kids, right?

1337
01:32:07,633 --> 01:32:09,160
lt's high time. Okay?

1338
01:32:09,265 --> 01:32:11,087
Stop treating us
like small kids.

1339
01:32:11,441 --> 01:32:13,742
l am not a kid. And you
know that very well.

1340
01:32:13,777 --> 01:32:15,271
What are you talking about?

1341
01:32:16,369 --> 01:32:19,784
Tanisha.A little girl
in this big bad world.

1342
01:32:19,825 --> 01:32:22,759
A young leaf that will
hit a big storm one day.

1343
01:32:22,801 --> 01:32:24,078
Some day soon.

1344
01:32:24,465 --> 01:32:26,637
l have read everything
on your laptop.

1345
01:32:26,929 --> 01:32:27,878
You watch me from your room.

1346
01:32:28,209 --> 01:32:29,551
And you write all that about me.

1347
01:32:30,673 --> 01:32:31,688
Why?

1348
01:32:35,089 --> 01:32:36,430
Say something.

1349
01:32:40,273 --> 01:32:41,702
l see Roshni in you.

1350
01:32:49,681 --> 01:32:53,576
That story l told
you...it's not a story.

1351
01:32:54,353 --> 01:32:55,157
lt was all true.

1352
01:32:58,833 --> 01:33:00,359
That day when l saw
you the first time..

1353
01:33:00,433 --> 01:33:03,335
..l felt l am seeing Roshni.

1354
01:33:04,785 --> 01:33:09,641
Just one look at you
and l decided to stay.

1355
01:33:11,889 --> 01:33:13,896
l don't know what
the similarity is.

1356
01:33:14,545 --> 01:33:16,203
You don't look like her.

1357
01:33:16,785 --> 01:33:18,410
But there is...

1358
01:33:19,441 --> 01:33:20,335
...there is something..

1359
01:33:20,401 --> 01:33:22,224
..that is common between
the both of you.

1360
01:33:22,833 --> 01:33:23,978
You remind me of her.

1361
01:33:27,921 --> 01:33:30,190
l wanted to be around you. l
wanted to see you everyday.

1362
01:33:30,225 --> 01:33:31,948
l wanted to talk to you.

1363
01:33:34,449 --> 01:33:35,759
l know this is
sounding a bit weird.

1364
01:33:35,793 --> 01:33:36,556
But...

1365
01:33:38,385 --> 01:33:39,814
...l couldn't stop myself.

1366
01:33:45,521 --> 01:33:48,238
Some people say that
there is nothing..

1367
01:33:48,273 --> 01:33:50,313
..like a coincidence
in this world.

1368
01:33:54,129 --> 01:33:55,157
You reminded me so strongly
of her that l wanted to know.

1369
01:33:57,521 --> 01:33:59,310
ls there something more to this?

1370
01:33:59,345 --> 01:34:01,734
ls there a deeper meaning?
A deeper connection?

1371
01:34:02,609 --> 01:34:05,097
Will this coincidence
mean anything?

1372
01:34:05,169 --> 01:34:06,118
l don't know if..

1373
01:34:09,521 --> 01:34:10,830
lt will.

1374
01:35:08,529 --> 01:35:13,069
''Let me walk with
you like that.''

1375
01:35:13,201 --> 01:35:16,649
''Let's make the
moments radiant.''

1376
01:35:17,425 --> 01:35:20,075
''Let it be vague.''

1377
01:35:20,113 --> 01:35:22,022
''Let it be hazy.''

1378
01:35:22,321 --> 01:35:25,191
''Let my dreams
be without you.''

1379
01:35:26,801 --> 01:35:30,958
''Let my heart do
as it pleases.''

1380
01:35:31,537 --> 01:35:33,359
''On the path of friendship.''

1381
01:35:33,521 --> 01:35:37,482
''Let's walk as two
individuals.''

1382
01:35:37,649 --> 01:35:42,286
''Blithe. We are carefree.''

1383
01:35:42,385 --> 01:35:46,891
''Let's hold our
dreams tightly.''

1384
01:35:47,377 --> 01:35:51,152
''We started living in love.''

1385
01:35:51,697 --> 01:35:55,157
''And distance started
disappearing.''

1386
01:35:56,433 --> 01:36:00,556
''We started
becoming carefree.''

1387
01:36:00,753 --> 01:36:05,063
''And hopes started soaring.''

1388
01:36:19,281 --> 01:36:20,742
How old are you? Why?

1389
01:36:21,329 --> 01:36:23,664
To decide that you are
not a pedophiliac.

1390
01:36:25,265 --> 01:36:27,272
What? Do l look like one?

1391
01:36:27,473 --> 01:36:29,862
Nowadays people are
not trustworthy.

1392
01:36:30,353 --> 01:36:32,393
People have multiple
personalities.

1393
01:36:33,073 --> 01:36:34,382
Okay. Let me guess.

1394
01:36:34,897 --> 01:36:36,206
3536?

1395
01:36:36,593 --> 01:36:39,081
32. Exactly double my age.

1396
01:36:43,409 --> 01:36:45,165
How many women have
you slept with?

1397
01:36:45,841 --> 01:36:47,151
What?

1398
01:36:47,473 --> 01:36:50,920
lf you don't want to tell me, it's okay.
l won't force you.

1399
01:36:56,881 --> 01:36:58,190
l love MJ.

1400
01:37:00,049 --> 01:37:01,543
Was he a pedophiliac?

1401
01:37:02,737 --> 01:37:04,297
God rest his soul.

1402
01:37:12,241 --> 01:37:15,340
lwas wondering since many days.
You didn't tell us.

1403
01:37:16,465 --> 01:37:17,894
Did you like it?

1404
01:37:18,225 --> 01:37:19,054
What?

1405
01:37:19,153 --> 01:37:21,902
Did you like killing
your father?

1406
01:37:23,761 --> 01:37:25,866
You see, l have never
murdered anyone.

1407
01:37:26,929 --> 01:37:28,074
You must have smashed his head.

1408
01:37:28,657 --> 01:37:29,802
lt must have made a noise.

1409
01:37:31,825 --> 01:37:33,351
You must have enjoyed it.

1410
01:37:33,457 --> 01:37:36,140
He killed his father.
He must have felt bad.

1411
01:37:36,209 --> 01:37:38,151
He must have had a reason.

1412
01:37:38,641 --> 01:37:40,845
Must have fulfilled
all his desires.

1413
01:37:48,081 --> 01:37:50,732
You took it too seriously.

1414
01:37:59,281 --> 01:38:01,103
Come on, sweetheart. See
you tomorrow in school.

1415
01:38:01,201 --> 01:38:03,176
l am scared. What happened?

1416
01:38:03,313 --> 01:38:06,477
l haven't got my period
since two months. Damn.

1417
01:38:06,737 --> 01:38:07,817
You didn't use protection?

1418
01:38:07,985 --> 01:38:10,189
Katrik said he has
good selfcontrol.

1419
01:38:10,705 --> 01:38:11,949
True.True.

1420
01:38:14,129 --> 01:38:16,365
Where are we going?
To the chemist.

1421
01:38:16,433 --> 01:38:18,572
To get a selftest kit.
l want to go home.

1422
01:38:18,641 --> 01:38:19,819
Nidhi, are you mad?

1423
01:38:20,177 --> 01:38:22,185
lf something is wrong, let's
take corrective measures. Okay?

1424
01:38:22,225 --> 01:38:23,981
lt won't be. l am sure.

1425
01:38:24,145 --> 01:38:26,862
At times it happens because
of stress too, right?

1426
01:38:27,057 --> 01:38:28,966
lt won't be. But
still, let's test it.

1427
01:38:29,041 --> 01:38:30,415
No. l don't want to do it.
l am okay.

1428
01:38:30,705 --> 01:38:32,014
l am going. Bye.

1429
01:38:32,049 --> 01:38:34,635
Why not? Anu, why are
you insisting so much?

1430
01:38:34,705 --> 01:38:35,850
Nidhi, just shut up.

1431
01:38:47,377 --> 01:38:48,937
How much? Rs.60.

1432
01:38:51,313 --> 01:38:54,030
So...who is the daddy?

1433
01:38:54,321 --> 01:38:55,157
Not you. Obviously.

1434
01:38:57,873 --> 01:38:58,985
One moment.

1435
01:38:59,414 --> 01:39:00,908
Anu.Anu.

1436
01:39:01,425 --> 01:39:02,472
What?

1437
01:39:02,876 --> 01:39:05,560
You did not tell me
why you dumped me.

1438
01:39:06,161 --> 01:39:07,568
Rishi, lwanted to be polite.

1439
01:39:07,601 --> 01:39:10,448
Butsince you insist, l dumped
you because you are small.

1440
01:39:10,577 --> 01:39:12,552
And l am not talking
about you rheight.

1441
01:39:15,889 --> 01:39:16,838
Witch.

1442
01:39:53,734 --> 01:39:55,157
Why do you guys worry? l
told you l will handle it.

1443
01:39:56,614 --> 01:39:59,745
You are talking as if you have
got it done 10 times before.

1444
01:39:59,942 --> 01:40:01,348
l will ask Vikram.

1445
01:40:01,478 --> 01:40:05,220
Don't be crazy. Men don't know
anything about these things.

1446
01:40:05,414 --> 01:40:08,097
Chill, guys. l said l
will take care of it.

1447
01:40:11,942 --> 01:40:12,891
That's it.

1448
01:40:13,829 --> 01:40:17,125
And...temperature set.

1449
01:40:17,861 --> 01:40:19,617
Have you been cooking
since childhood?

1450
01:40:20,389 --> 01:40:21,600
Are you crazy?

1451
01:40:21,798 --> 01:40:23,205
l had to learn it when
l went to London.

1452
01:40:24,262 --> 01:40:26,269
At home mom wouldn't even
let me enter the kitchen.

1453
01:40:27,302 --> 01:40:29,920
One moment. l hope
you like this.

1454
01:40:32,966 --> 01:40:35,268
By the way, does Tanisha
like Continental?

1455
01:40:37,702 --> 01:40:40,735
Vikram, it's really
nice to have you here.

1456
01:40:41,413 --> 01:40:43,552
Since your arrival
things seem stable.

1457
01:40:44,614 --> 01:40:45,923
Tanisha also likes you a lot.

1458
01:40:46,917 --> 01:40:49,667
She doesn't say it. But
she misses her father.

1459
01:40:58,246 --> 01:41:00,634
Don't bake it for more
than 30 minutes. Yes.

1460
01:41:00,838 --> 01:41:02,626
And...l will just come.

1461
01:41:03,622 --> 01:41:04,898
l have to make an important
phone call. Yes.

1462
01:41:10,758 --> 01:41:13,725
My friend's girlfriend also
got it done from here.

1463
01:41:15,558 --> 01:41:17,184
This doctor is very nice.

1464
01:41:19,109 --> 01:41:21,019
Guys, don't worry.
She will be alright.

1465
01:41:21,318 --> 01:41:23,228
You look more worried than us.

1466
01:41:25,638 --> 01:41:27,645
Your patient has developed
some complications.

1467
01:41:27,718 --> 01:41:29,758
Shift her to a bigger hospital.

1468
01:41:30,534 --> 01:41:31,679
No need to be afraid.

1469
01:41:31,781 --> 01:41:34,465
At times there are
complications in such cases.

1470
01:41:59,462 --> 01:42:00,706
Rs.10000 advance.

1471
01:42:04,614 --> 01:42:05,891
Here.

1472
01:42:06,086 --> 01:42:07,296
Patient's parents?

1473
01:42:14,629 --> 01:42:15,393
How is she?

1474
01:42:15,462 --> 01:42:18,331
You will have to sign
as her guardian. Okay.

1475
01:42:22,661 --> 01:42:23,741
She is my niece.

1476
01:42:31,653 --> 01:42:33,563
We will have to
tell her parents.

1477
01:42:34,054 --> 01:42:36,126
They will keep her in the
hospital for at least2 days.

1478
01:42:36,166 --> 01:42:38,554
Are you mad? No ways.

1479
01:42:38,854 --> 01:42:41,243
Do doctors discharge
someone so quickly?

1480
01:42:41,446 --> 01:42:43,268
They also have to make money.

1481
01:42:43,654 --> 01:42:45,180
She has informed
them for one day.

1482
01:42:45,286 --> 01:42:47,293
After that we need
a valid excuse.

1483
01:42:47,558 --> 01:42:49,598
lt's entirely your fault.
Now you think.

1484
01:42:50,053 --> 01:42:53,152
l will think. First let me think
what to say to my family.

1485
01:43:01,669 --> 01:43:02,847
What are you thinking?

1486
01:43:06,246 --> 01:43:07,773
Nothing.

1487
01:43:11,590 --> 01:43:15,550
Often silence says such a lot.

1488
01:43:17,958 --> 01:43:20,740
Let me say just one thing
and then I'll go silent.

1489
01:43:22,363 --> 01:43:24,818
l feel so secure when
you are with me.

1490
01:43:26,908 --> 01:43:28,566
l am really lucky.

1491
01:43:29,628 --> 01:43:31,603
You're my perfect guide.

1492
01:43:37,756 --> 01:43:39,381
Perfection does not exist.

1493
01:44:00,764 --> 01:44:02,652
Hi, aunt. What's up? Nothing.

1494
01:44:03,165 --> 01:44:04,659
What are you reading?

1495
01:44:05,660 --> 01:44:07,067
Vikram's first book.

1496
01:44:07,164 --> 01:44:08,593
ln the middle of the end.

1497
01:44:08,700 --> 01:44:11,002
lt's a nice book.
l have read it.

1498
01:44:14,748 --> 01:44:16,090
When did you read it?

1499
01:44:16,284 --> 01:44:17,713
Vikram had given me.

1500
01:44:19,548 --> 01:44:22,330
Why do you call him Vikram?
Don't you have manners?

1501
01:44:22,396 --> 01:44:25,692
He is so much elder than you.
He has told me.

1502
01:44:28,540 --> 01:44:29,205
Okay, listen.

1503
01:44:33,436 --> 01:44:34,843
How do you find Vikram?

1504
01:44:35,260 --> 01:44:37,715
Aunt, l am not of
marriageable age now.

1505
01:44:39,260 --> 01:44:40,689
l am not talking about you.

1506
01:44:47,996 --> 01:44:49,883
Are you serious?

1507
01:44:54,428 --> 01:44:55,157
Did you speak to him?

1508
01:44:56,444 --> 01:44:58,549
No. l will now.

1509
01:45:07,612 --> 01:45:09,139
l don't know, aunt.

1510
01:45:12,285 --> 01:45:14,325
l never saw him in that light.

1511
01:45:20,636 --> 01:45:21,618
Tanu.

1512
01:45:22,780 --> 01:45:23,860
Tanu, what happened?

1513
01:45:24,124 --> 01:45:25,368
Why are you crying?

1514
01:45:26,524 --> 01:45:28,980
Silly. l am not leaving you.

1515
01:45:30,525 --> 01:45:31,572
Tanu.

1516
01:45:32,764 --> 01:45:37,139
l think l just need time
to get used to the idea.

1517
01:45:50,173 --> 01:45:51,285
Tanu,

1518
01:45:53,980 --> 01:45:55,157
am l looking nervous? Why?

1519
01:45:58,044 --> 01:46:00,892
l am going to tell Vikram. Now?

1520
01:46:04,636 --> 01:46:05,945
I'll wait here.

1521
01:46:06,460 --> 01:46:07,802
Alright.

1522
01:46:10,493 --> 01:46:11,834
Wish me luck.

1523
01:46:13,148 --> 01:46:15,287
All the best. Thank you.

1524
01:46:24,156 --> 01:46:24,952
Yes.

1525
01:46:29,852 --> 01:46:30,615
Oh.

1526
01:46:31,292 --> 01:46:32,437
Hi. Hi.

1527
01:46:32,540 --> 01:46:34,427
l need to talk to you.
Sure. Come in.

1528
01:46:44,701 --> 01:46:47,570
See, Vikram. I'll be
straight with you.

1529
01:46:50,844 --> 01:46:52,055
l really like you.

1530
01:46:55,740 --> 01:46:57,169
Both of us are lonely.

1531
01:46:58,300 --> 01:46:59,642
We both deserve love.

1532
01:47:00,509 --> 01:47:02,451
And we are both
nice people, right?

1533
01:47:04,316 --> 01:47:07,731
So let us give it a chance.

1534
01:47:12,285 --> 01:47:16,114
Dipti, l need to think about it.

1535
01:47:17,468 --> 01:47:21,178
Yes. Of course. Of course.

1536
01:47:35,004 --> 01:47:37,077
Okay. See you.

1537
01:47:37,597 --> 01:47:38,644
Okay.

1538
01:47:39,421 --> 01:47:40,468
Good night.

1539
01:47:40,956 --> 01:47:41,971
Good night.

1540
01:47:46,845 --> 01:47:48,089
What did he say?

1541
01:47:49,340 --> 01:47:52,122
He'll think about it. But
I'msure he'll say yes.

1542
01:47:55,004 --> 01:47:55,157
l hope so too, aunt.

1543
01:47:57,116 --> 01:47:58,709
Good night. Good night.

1544
01:48:36,604 --> 01:48:39,474
The family has left.
The old man is alone.

1545
01:48:41,948 --> 01:48:43,028
Let's attack.

1546
01:48:44,732 --> 01:48:46,325
I've arranged the gun.

1547
01:48:46,652 --> 01:48:48,059
You'll get it.

1548
01:48:49,149 --> 01:48:51,538
You're the only one experienced.

1549
01:48:52,412 --> 01:48:55,157
lf the old man wakes up,
shoot him in the skull.

1550
01:48:55,740 --> 01:48:57,202
l don't know to use a gun.

1551
01:48:57,308 --> 01:49:00,953
Pull the trigger from two feet.
Simple.

1552
01:49:02,108 --> 01:49:04,018
So why don't you do it?

1553
01:49:04,060 --> 01:49:06,743
But you are the
master of murder.

1554
01:49:12,700 --> 01:49:15,602
Aunt will get more suspicious
if you talk like a patient.

1555
01:49:16,348 --> 01:49:18,836
You are happy. Mind
you,you are in school.

1556
01:49:19,453 --> 01:49:22,103
Guys,you are making
me more nervous.

1557
01:49:22,333 --> 01:49:24,242
Okay, fine. Talk to her.

1558
01:49:28,924 --> 01:49:29,939
Hello.

1559
01:49:30,364 --> 01:49:31,706
Yes, mom.

1560
01:49:32,252 --> 01:49:33,812
l am fine.

1561
01:49:34,940 --> 01:49:37,558
l have to go for community
service after school.

1562
01:49:37,949 --> 01:49:40,731
I'll stay at Anu's house
if it gets late atnight.

1563
01:49:42,684 --> 01:49:44,310
I'll try, mom.

1564
01:49:45,724 --> 01:49:49,020
Yes, Vikram. But don't
worry if l don'tcome.

1565
01:49:49,180 --> 01:49:51,220
Anu has extra dress.

1566
01:49:56,701 --> 01:49:57,562
Hello.

1567
01:49:59,004 --> 01:49:59,866
What?

1568
01:50:23,004 --> 01:50:23,768
Oh no.

1569
01:50:24,764 --> 01:50:26,258
l know that Rishi has done this.

1570
01:50:51,228 --> 01:50:52,275
Okay.

1571
01:50:54,556 --> 01:50:55,157
Dad is coming tonight.

1572
01:50:57,948 --> 01:50:59,442
Vikram is leaving tomorrow.

1573
01:51:08,252 --> 01:51:09,430
What happened?

1574
01:51:10,396 --> 01:51:11,444
l have to go.

1575
01:51:36,476 --> 01:51:37,491
Sit.

1576
01:51:38,844 --> 01:51:40,568
Don't show attitude. Sit.

1577
01:51:41,276 --> 01:51:44,310
Dad, please don't irritate.
l am in a bad mood anyways.

1578
01:51:44,348 --> 01:51:47,316
Anu, this is not the way to talk.
Talk properly.

1579
01:51:48,380 --> 01:51:49,722
Come on. We have
to go to school.

1580
01:51:49,884 --> 01:51:51,029
l won't go.

1581
01:51:56,924 --> 01:51:58,746
But how could you do this?

1582
01:52:00,060 --> 01:52:01,522
You can do what you want.

1583
01:52:01,628 --> 01:52:04,214
You should've guided me.
You're elder.

1584
01:52:04,316 --> 01:52:06,072
Have you ever sought
our guidance?

1585
01:52:06,172 --> 01:52:07,896
We have done so much for you.

1586
01:52:07,965 --> 01:52:09,394
Education. Facilities.

1587
01:52:09,533 --> 01:52:12,216
And we were as friendly
with you as we could be.

1588
01:52:13,373 --> 01:52:15,195
Friends share secrets, mom.

1589
01:52:15,580 --> 01:52:17,752
Oh. So now you have
become so mature..

1590
01:52:17,884 --> 01:52:20,055
..that we need to share
our secrets with you.

1591
01:52:24,700 --> 01:52:25,845
l am not coming.

1592
01:52:27,580 --> 01:52:29,009
Mrs. Kalsi, we did a mistake.

1593
01:52:29,116 --> 01:52:30,261
You know how kids
are these days.

1594
01:52:30,332 --> 01:52:31,991
lf it had been any other
girl other than Anu..

1595
01:52:32,156 --> 01:52:33,815
..would you have let her
remain in the school?

1596
01:52:34,108 --> 01:52:35,515
She sets a bad example.

1597
01:52:35,932 --> 01:52:38,899
Ma'am, it wasn't my fault.
Whose fault was it?

1598
01:52:39,100 --> 01:52:40,889
ls this the age to
be doing all this?

1599
01:52:41,500 --> 01:52:42,929
Sorry, ma'am. l am sorry.

1600
01:52:43,004 --> 01:52:44,914
But you can not remain in
this school any longer.

1601
01:52:45,532 --> 01:52:48,402
But ma'am, we have always
paid your fees on time.

1602
01:52:48,508 --> 01:52:49,752
Shut up, Anu.

1603
01:52:50,396 --> 01:52:53,080
lf you want some more
donation, l can pay you.

1604
01:52:53,181 --> 01:52:54,642
lt's not the question
of donations.

1605
01:52:54,940 --> 01:52:55,157
Our reputation is at stake.

1606
01:52:56,380 --> 01:52:59,195
All l can do for you is give her
a good character certificate.

1607
01:52:59,228 --> 01:53:01,912
Well, in that case, thank
you so much, Mrs. Kalsi.

1608
01:53:03,196 --> 01:53:05,781
We had never imagined
that our family will..

1609
01:53:05,821 --> 01:53:06,769
..suffer ignominy
because of you.

1610
01:53:06,844 --> 01:53:10,227
Mom,you are more worried about
your reputation than me.

1611
01:53:10,332 --> 01:53:14,456
Reputation is at stake. Your life.
And your career.

1612
01:53:14,557 --> 01:53:17,688
And if this gets out, it can
ruin everything. l tell you.

1613
01:53:17,980 --> 01:53:20,882
Nothing's going to happen. So
many MMS are floating around.

1614
01:53:21,148 --> 01:53:22,970
And anyway,the
profession l am in.

1615
01:53:23,004 --> 01:53:24,826
Any publicity is good publicity.

1616
01:53:24,988 --> 01:53:26,265
Did you leak it?

1617
01:53:29,053 --> 01:53:30,962
l didn' task him to leak it.

1618
01:53:31,420 --> 01:53:32,369
Wait a minute.

1619
01:53:32,668 --> 01:53:34,424
Give me your purse. What
are you going to do?

1620
01:53:34,492 --> 01:53:35,867
l said give me your purse.

1621
01:53:37,308 --> 01:53:38,453
Give me the purse.

1622
01:53:41,500 --> 01:53:44,020
We have misused the
freedom we gave you.

1623
01:53:44,124 --> 01:53:47,768
Now you'll not step out of the
house till this matter dies down.

1624
01:54:49,628 --> 01:54:51,417
Hey Anu, nice job.

1625
01:54:51,517 --> 01:54:53,371
You've become a star.

1626
01:55:01,916 --> 01:55:04,884
Nidhi, I'msorry.

1627
01:55:05,884 --> 01:55:07,411
lt's okay.

1628
01:55:17,404 --> 01:55:18,517
Hello, aunt. Hello.

1629
01:55:18,749 --> 01:55:20,952
You know where Nidhi
is, don'tyou?

1630
01:55:32,284 --> 01:55:34,740
Hello, aunt. Please leave.

1631
01:55:35,132 --> 01:55:37,237
I'll look after her.
Sorry, aunt.

1632
01:55:40,316 --> 01:55:42,259
Are you alright?

1633
01:55:43,420 --> 01:55:45,875
Don't worry. Everything
will be alright.

1634
01:55:50,492 --> 01:55:53,361
Dad is going to come here
straight from the airport.

1635
01:55:58,109 --> 01:55:59,091
When are you going?

1636
01:56:01,404 --> 01:56:02,135
Tomorrow.

1637
01:56:06,108 --> 01:56:07,352
Have you told aunt?

1638
01:56:17,244 --> 01:56:22,296
l have realised in life
coincidences don't mean anything.

1639
01:56:23,677 --> 01:56:25,586
lt's your destiny that matters.

1640
01:56:28,381 --> 01:56:29,908
Maybe you are right.

1641
01:56:32,284 --> 01:56:34,618
l still haven't understood...

1642
01:56:37,404 --> 01:56:39,379
...as to why mom and
dad have to die.

1643
01:56:41,532 --> 01:56:43,419
Why did Ashwin kill his dad?

1644
01:56:45,757 --> 01:56:47,666
Why did Sameer break my heart?

1645
01:56:50,332 --> 01:56:52,187
Why aunt has to love you?

1646
01:57:01,084 --> 01:57:03,026
And the curse continues.

1647
01:57:13,884 --> 01:57:15,411
Maybe that's my destiny.

1648
01:57:34,780 --> 01:57:37,562
Come on. Quick. Come on.

1649
01:57:42,301 --> 01:57:43,413
Come on.

1650
01:58:02,876 --> 01:58:03,824
Go.

1651
01:58:35,805 --> 01:58:36,732
Shoot him.

1652
01:58:37,052 --> 01:58:38,394
Come on. Shoot him.

1653
01:58:38,972 --> 01:58:39,987
Shoot him.

1654
01:58:40,476 --> 01:58:44,251
You guys are making a mistake.
Kill him.

1655
01:58:45,596 --> 01:58:47,571
Shoot the old man. Shoot.

1656
02:00:18,973 --> 02:00:20,947
Nidhi, your dad is here.

1657
02:00:38,268 --> 02:00:39,578
l want to sleep with you.

1658
02:00:51,548 --> 02:00:53,915
Mom, l don't want to meet dad.

1659
02:01:17,181 --> 02:01:18,904
These kids come
with a lot of hope.

1660
02:01:19,453 --> 02:01:20,532
And they know a lot.

1661
02:01:20,892 --> 02:01:22,037
Theyknow what's
happeningin the world.

1662
02:01:22,268 --> 02:01:23,610
They know about technology.

1663
02:01:23,964 --> 02:01:26,200
They think they know
how the world works.

1664
02:01:26,364 --> 02:01:28,219
And how they can manipulate it.

1665
02:02:16,572 --> 02:02:18,001
Hello. Hello, brother.

1666
02:02:18,364 --> 02:02:19,444
What are you doing?

1667
02:02:20,860 --> 02:02:22,136
Suicide.

1668
02:02:22,172 --> 02:02:24,660
Okay. Let's do it together.
Whatsay?

1669
02:02:26,076 --> 02:02:27,637
Why? Why would you?

1670
02:02:28,604 --> 02:02:29,913
Since l am so far
away from all ofyou.

1671
02:02:30,045 --> 02:02:31,059
l can do this at least.

1672
02:02:31,869 --> 02:02:33,494
By the way, l am
coming on Sunday.

1673
02:02:34,908 --> 02:02:36,763
I'll talk to you later. Bye.

1674
02:02:46,748 --> 02:02:49,912
But the problem is that the
world is a master manipulator.

1675
02:02:50,492 --> 02:02:53,362
And it is much harder to
understand the world's formula..

1676
02:02:53,468 --> 02:02:55,157
..than any maths, physicsor
chemistry for mula.

1677
02:02:56,796 --> 02:02:58,706
But this generation which
has grown up on fast food..

1678
02:02:59,101 --> 02:03:00,278
..want everything fast.

1679
02:03:01,629 --> 02:03:03,090
They are not ready to wait.

1680
02:03:13,949 --> 02:03:15,475
l want to sleep with you.

1681
02:04:29,404 --> 02:04:30,680
And the world doesn't
know it yet.

1682
02:04:30,780 --> 02:04:32,569
But it's changing.

1683
02:04:33,436 --> 02:04:35,378
And it's these kids that
are changing the world..

1684
02:04:36,284 --> 02:04:37,494
..without really knowing it.

1685
02:04:37,629 --> 02:04:41,851
Mom, l don't want to meet dad.
l don't want to meet him.

1686
02:04:42,044 --> 02:04:44,826
Please. Don't let him in.

1687
02:04:47,996 --> 02:04:52,633
I'll meet him later. Please.

1688
02:05:09,884 --> 02:05:10,833
How are you?

1689
02:05:11,516 --> 02:05:12,923
l am sorry, dad.

1690
02:05:15,836 --> 02:05:17,363
Did l say anything to you?

1691
02:05:17,437 --> 02:05:18,517
l am very sorry.

1692
02:05:18,588 --> 02:05:19,537
Stop crying.

1693
02:05:21,277 --> 02:05:22,553
Quiet.

1694
02:05:23,132 --> 02:05:24,277
Stop crying.

1695
02:05:24,572 --> 02:05:26,295
l said stop crying.

1696
02:05:29,469 --> 02:05:31,160
You were crying even
when l had left.

1697
02:05:31,612 --> 02:05:33,074
And you are crying even
when l have returned.

1698
02:05:41,500 --> 02:05:43,387
lt is not easyto
understand these kids.

1699
02:05:43,516 --> 02:05:46,167
And you don't find the sensibility
needed to understand..

1700
02:05:46,396 --> 02:05:48,119
..them at any mall.

1701
02:05:48,413 --> 02:05:51,195
And nor can it be downloaded
from any website.

1702
02:05:51,836 --> 02:05:53,211
This is the biggest problem.

1703
02:06:00,989 --> 02:06:02,614
Shoot the old man.

1704
02:06:04,924 --> 02:06:06,353
Shoot him.

1705
02:06:12,061 --> 02:06:13,337
Shoot him.

1706
02:06:13,404 --> 02:06:14,931
Come on. Come on.

1707
02:06:21,884 --> 02:06:24,088
ls this the age to
be doing all this?

1708
02:06:26,780 --> 02:06:28,602
My son is an lAS officer.

1709
02:07:09,788 --> 02:07:11,446
Sixteen is a tough place to be.

1710
02:07:11,836 --> 02:07:14,803
Hormones, dreams,
parents, police.

1711
02:07:15,676 --> 02:07:17,563
l wouldn't want to go
through them again.

1712
02:07:18,236 --> 02:07:19,698
lt's an exciting age.

1713
02:07:19,804 --> 02:07:22,968
And they are living
in exciting times.

1714
02:07:33,235 --> 02:07:35,690
Guys, l really
enjoythe study trips.

1715
02:07:35,908 --> 02:07:37,915
We go to a place near Bengaluru.

1716
02:07:38,396 --> 02:07:40,600
l am going to Lakshwadeep
for the summer holidays.

1717
02:07:40,733 --> 02:07:42,773
To learn scuba diving. Wow.

1718
02:07:44,317 --> 02:07:46,204
l just want to drop
out of this school.

1719
02:07:46,237 --> 02:07:49,782
l don't like girl's school.
No cute boys.

1720
02:07:50,077 --> 02:07:54,200
Well, you go for these trips.
Do you just study?

1721

Let's see. Your MMS will
get even more hits.

1723
02:08:07,036 --> 02:08:08,378
Did you tell mom and dad?

1724
02:08:08,476 --> 02:08:10,199
They are being very supportive.

1725
02:08:10,396 --> 02:08:11,574
l really love them.

1726
02:08:26,876 --> 02:08:27,824
Goal.

1727
02:08:34,812 --> 02:08:35,794
Goal.

1728
02:10:30,236 --> 02:10:34,033
''We don't care.
We don't judge.''

1729
02:10:34,172 --> 02:10:37,588
''We just want to live like
it's the end oft he world.''

1730
02:10:38,173 --> 02:10:42,002
''Young and free at sixteen.''

1731
02:10:42,396 --> 02:10:46,324
''Drinks, fights, girls, lights.
That's what life's like.''

1732
02:10:46,396 --> 02:10:49,692
''Sixteen.''

1733
02:10:52,348 --> 02:10:54,290
''Sixteen.''

1734
02:10:56,317 --> 02:11:00,343
''Sixteen. Hats off
to sweet sixteen.''

1735
02:11:03,708 --> 02:11:07,734
''Lots of issues before time.''

1736
02:11:08,445 --> 02:11:11,860
''lnnocent minds have
been corrupted.''

1737
02:11:12,092 --> 02:11:20,123
''What life wants to give you,
take it away before hand.''

1738
02:11:20,156 --> 02:11:25,143
''Do everything
that is useless.''

1739
02:11:26,012 --> 02:11:31,446
''Hats off to sweet sixteen.''

1740
02:11:34,365 --> 02:11:40,081
''Hats off to darn sixteen.''

1741

''This is an
addiction.To get high.''

1742
