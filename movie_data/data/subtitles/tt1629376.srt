1
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:02,909
Burnt along with the entire house.

2
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:07,622
Married to six men, and strangely
all of them are dead.

3
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:14,712
I'm sure you've seen what
we've recovered.

4
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,969
We need to do a DNA profiling.

5
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,513
Hope you're not too busy.

6
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:30,895
It's a priority case.

7
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,735
Arun?

8
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:21,112
What are you doing?

9
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,086
How come you never
showed this to me?

10
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:39,672
Why?

11
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:54,937
Is this Susanna?

12
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:59,358
Saheb.

13
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:03,780
Now, she's no more.

14
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:16,459
<span style="style.default_1">Detached from life, and</span>
<span style="style.default_1">torn apart by love,</span>

15
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:19,629
<span style="style.default_1">My Saheb was melancholic.</span>

16
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:25,301
<span style="style.default_1">All her life, she was in search</span>
<span style="style.default_1">for her eternal love.</span>

17
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,349
<span style="style.default_1">She was very lonely.</span>

18
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,978
<span style="style.default_1">Just an infant when</span>
<span style="style.default_1">she lost her mother,</span>

19
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:38,231
<span style="style.default_1">and before she could become</span>
<span style="style.default_1">an adult, her father died.</span>

20
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:42,944
<span style="style.default_1">My senior Saheb, her father.</span>

21
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:45,780
<span style="style.default_1">He was her everything!</span>

22
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:48,825
<span style="style.default_1">Friend, mother, and brother.</span>

23
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:51,327
<span style="style.default_1">And after he was gone</span>

24
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:56,165
<span style="style.default_1">she tried hard to find</span>
<span style="style.default_1">him in every man she met.</span>

25
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:07,844
<span style="style.default_1">On the day of her father's funeral</span>

26
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:11,389
<span style="style.default_1">in full black attire, she</span>
<span style="style.default_1">reminded me of soft snow</span>

27
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:18,438
<span style="style.default_1">rolling off the mountain</span>
<span style="style.default_1">on a silent night.</span>

28
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,531
<span style="style.default_1">No wonder she radiated in black.</span>

29
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:34,287
<span style="style.default_1">And soon, it became her colour.</span>

30
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:45,339
<span style="style.default_1">Uncle Goonga!</span>

31
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,885
<span style="style.default_1">He was dumb but he had a lot to say.</span>

32
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,346
<span style="style.default_1">I was born an orphan!</span>

33
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:59,061
<span style="style.default_1">Don't know if he adopted</span>
<span style="style.default_1">me or I adopted him.</span>

34
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,067
<span style="style.default_1">My first real competition.</span>

35
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:08,154
<span style="style.default_1">And senior Saheb's last wish.</span>

36
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,822
<span style="style.default_1">The first husband,</span>

37
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,074
<span style="style.default_1">Major Edwin Rodriques.</span>

38
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:17,205
Goonga!

39
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,332
How much longer?

40
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:25,838
Ghalib!

41
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:30,760
He says, everything will be
ready in the next half an hour.

42
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:39,977
I don't want to see any
of his boys around.

43
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:47,068
<span style="style.default_1">Ghalib.</span>

44
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:52,990
<span style="style.default_1">Poet by name, butler by profession</span>
<span style="style.default_1">and mocks a Bollywood villain.</span>

45
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,335
Anything else, sir?

46
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,298
What did he say?

47
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,634
Thank you, sir!

48
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:27,400
If he knew you were calling him
a fucker he'd pull your eyes out.

49
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:33,239
<span style="style.default_1">Ghalib.</span>

50
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:44,542
<span style="style.default_1">The third ace in her trio.</span>

51
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:47,628
<span style="style.default_1">Maggie aunty!</span>

52
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:50,172
<span style="style.default_1">Under whose care Saheb grew up.</span>

53
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:53,759
<span style="style.default_1">She became her mother</span>
<span style="style.default_1">and her best friend.</span>

54
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:58,556
<span style="style.default_1">She had a few other friends too.</span>

55
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:03,644
<span style="style.default_1">Venomous, dangerous...</span>

56
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:09,066
<span style="style.default_1">but faithful like no other.</span>

57
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:25,082
Goonga was daddy's favourite jockey.

58
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,851
Why don't we hire a professional
rider from abroad?

59
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,740
What do you think you're doing?

60
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:59,033
Stealing!

61
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:11,003
Show me your hands!

62
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,137
Whose rascal is this?

63
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:24,308
I picked a few for Candy, Sir.

64
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:26,268
Who's Candy?

65
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:28,145
Your new horse.

66
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:40,449
How much have you studied?

67
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:48,332
Anything else?

68
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:36,797
Miss Saheb, forgive me!

69
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:39,008
Thought I'd help this orphan.

70
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:42,178
Will send this fool
back to the village.

71
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,891
You won't see this rat anymore.

72
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:01,030
He won't be seen here anymore.

73
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,743
Because he'll be starting
school tomorrow.

74
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:21,592
Saheb, thank you!

75
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:44,615
<span style="style.default_1">Snap! My life changed</span>
<span style="style.default_1">in a split second.</span>

76
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:49,411
<span style="style.default_1">Saheb picked me up from</span>
<span style="style.default_1">a bed of thorns</span>

77
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:52,164
<span style="style.default_1">and placed me on a bed of roses.</span>

78
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:56,377
This is the new admission
I was talking about.

79
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:00,506
<span style="style.default_1">She was my goddess.</span>

80
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,972
<span style="style.default_1">And I, her blind devotee.</span>

81
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:19,775
All said and done Arun, the
Major was pretty handsome.

82
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:27,533
The perfect Indian husband.

83
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:34,957
Boring, possessive, insecure
and a doubting Thomas.

84
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:39,753
Mr. Stinker!

85
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:55,686
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

86
00:14:56,353 --> 00:15:01,108
All throughout operation Blue Star.

87
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:25,341
I can't figure out if you're getting
older or younger by the day.

88
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:29,345
Edwin is greying fast
but you look the same.

89
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,898
Really, since when?

90
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,860
Since yesterday.
Every morning, I quit drinking.

91
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:03,123
Really!

92
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:27,249
"I quit every morning."

93
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:33,589
Stop fluttering around.

94
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:19,718
Why do you keep reminding
me of my disability?

95
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,455
It's high time we had a child.

96
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:56,922
Once you're a mother, you'll
learn wifely duties too.

97
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:22,239
Did you visit the gynaecologist?

98
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:29,913
All tests are normal.

99
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:44,136
The doctor says, there's
nothing wrong with me.

100
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,108
So now...

101
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:01,570
I'm disabled in bed too?

102
00:22:54,414 --> 00:23:00,295
How often have I told you
to knock before entering?

103
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:17,104
Next time, I'll bury you alive.

104
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:34,830
This was bound to happen,
my friends!

105
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:38,500
Marry in a haste and...

106
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:44,005
Repent at leisure.

107
00:23:50,428 --> 00:23:52,305
You want to break his other leg?

108
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:20,125
Sir! Are you alright?

109
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:17,474
Goonga! Goonga!

110
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:36,952
Goonga! Goonga!

111
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:51,716
Goonga! Goonga!

112
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:19,411
Goonga! Goonga!

113
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,938
Goonga, what happened?

114
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:30,273
What happened?

115
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:32,359
What happened?

116
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:37,113
Ghalib... Ghalib!

117
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:45,372
He will survive.

118
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:51,252
But we're sorry, we couldn't
save his eye.

119
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:03,598
One eye is enough to witness
what's going to happen.

120
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:28,415
<span style="style.default_1">The next time I saw the</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Major for the last time.</span>

121
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:33,753
<span style="style.default_1">Going to the dense forest</span>
<span style="style.default_1">looking for a man eating panther.</span>

122
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:28,767
Or the animal won't come.

123
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,938
The beast in me is already here.

124
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:39,360
Major sir.

125
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:40,779
Major sir, panther.

126
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:19,818
<span style="style.default_1">The panther wasn't interested</span>
<span style="style.default_1">in the goat.</span>

127
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,111
<span style="style.default_1">He was looking for humans.</span>

128
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:27,242
<span style="style.default_1">Can't tell whether the Major</span>
<span style="style.default_1">lost his balance...</span>

129
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:30,870
<span style="style.default_1">or whether someone pushed him.</span>

130
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:32,539
<span style="style.default_1">Nevertheless</span>

131
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:35,959
<span style="style.default_1">it took the forest officials</span>
<span style="style.default_1">two days to find the Major</span>

132
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:40,505
<span style="style.default_1">or whatever was left of him.</span>

133
00:30:53,726 --> 00:30:59,315
<span style="style.default_1">I just couldn't get myself</span>
<span style="style.default_1">to mourn for the Major.</span>

134
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:04,988
<span style="style.default_1">Fate had given me another chance</span>

135
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:07,156
<span style="style.default_1">to woo my Saheb.</span>

136
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:13,705
<span style="style.default_1">Like a balloon,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">my hopes went soaring.</span>

137
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:20,879
<span style="style.default_1">But she chose the guitar instead.</span>

138
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:37,205
<span style="style.default_1">Indian women fall for</span>
<span style="style.default_1">a guitarist over a riff.</span>

139
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:40,541
<span style="style.default_1">And this asshole had</span>
<span style="style.default_1">the vocal chords too.</span>

140
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:49,342
<span style="style.default_1">Before the wedding this creature</span>
<span style="style.default_1">was called Jamshed Singh Rathod.</span>

141
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:52,136
From now I'm Jimmy.

142
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:10,905
Made for each other, that's right!

143
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:29,173
<span style="style.default_1">Her lips were ripe and so close</span>

144
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:32,010
<span style="style.default_1">Oh Mama</span>

145
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:35,930
<span style="style.default_1">Oh Mama</span>

146
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:42,603
<span style="style.default_1">I looked at them</span>
<span style="style.default_1">And all but froze</span>

147
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:45,398
<span style="style.default_1">Oh Mama</span>

148
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:49,318
<span style="style.default_1">Oh Mama</span>

149
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:53,156
You wrote this for me?

150
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:57,326
No, it sprung from within.

151
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:23,102
<span style="style.default_1">Oh Mama</span>

152
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:29,817
<span style="style.default_1">Oh Mama</span>

153
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:36,240
<span style="style.default_1">Oh Mama</span>

154
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:39,118
<span style="style.default_1">Oh Mama</span>

155
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:45,750
<span style="style.default_1">My heart now only thinks</span>
<span style="style.default_1">From the heart</span>

156
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:49,670
<span style="style.default_1">Oh Mama</span>

157
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:52,965
<span style="style.default_1">Oh Mama</span>

158
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:59,347

Okay that's enough!

188
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,135
What's the proof this is yours?

189
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:27,722
This was my college composition.

190
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:31,559
Jamshed was the backup
vocalist in my band.

191
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:34,103
Bloody thief.

192
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:36,856
Where the hell is he? Call him.

193
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:39,984
Here's proof.

194
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:45,197
It first came out in English, now
they're launching the holy version.

195
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,336
Now what do you want?

196
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:00,629
Respect.

197
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:07,053
Shall we?

198
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:17,396
Thanks man!
Here's a new composition.

The Berlin wall has collapsed.

226
00:40:53,325 --> 00:40:55,744
So has the government.

227
00:40:57,371 --> 00:40:59,915
And you're stuck on cocaine?

228
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:06,630
This is what you call heroin!

229
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:11,969
No one has the balls to
behave in this manner.

This is Bappi's song!

When did you come?

250
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:47,398
Why didn't you inform me?

251
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:58,409
We were playing a game!

252

00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:00,911
You wanna play?

254
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:02,413

Why are you doing this to me?

I won't go back to drugs!

I will choke you to
death once I'm free.

00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:29,875
You are messing with
Jamshed Singh Rathod.

I am of royal blood.

I can't leave him alone.

Who else could own such
a beautiful piece?

279
00:45:46,034 --> 00:45:48,078
I recognized it as soon as I saw it.

280
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:52,416
It's priceless too. How much?

00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:58,714
You never put a price on priceless

00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:11,286
Thank you. Nevertheless.

293
00:47:11,411 --> 00:47:15,332
I don't think I would ever...
maybe another time.

294
00:47:15,415 --> 00:47:21,630
Right now, it's not appropriate.

00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:07,587
Snake temple?

300
00:50:08,755 --> 00:50:10,674
But madame is a Christian.

301
00:50:12,634 --> 00:50:13,802
Yes, she is!

302
00:50:14,761 --> 00:50:17,431
Her father was a Christian,
but mother, a Hindu.

303
00:50:17,931 --> 00:50:19,349
She set it up.

305

-How?
-She goes down.

306
00:50:25,605 --> 00:50:27,107
Isn't she scared?

307
00:50:27,232 --> 00:50:29,317
No! They're her pets.

308
00:50:29,609 --> 00:50:34,781
She thinks humans
are more poisonous.

309
00:50:38,326 --> 00:50:39,411
Wow!

310
00:50:41,663 --> 00:50:43,248
That's great.

00:50:44,332 --> 00:50:45,459
Sir, snake!

312
00:50:47,252 --> 00:50:49,296
Are you alright, sir?
Yes, I'm fine.

313

316
00:51:19,451 --> 00:51:21,369
-Could be anyone's.
-No, no.

317
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:24,039
Not just anyone's.

318
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:26,500
It belongs to the murderer.

319
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:28,376
Murderer?

320
00:51:57,239 --> 00:51:59,449
-Is anyone left?
-Yes, there is.

321
00:52:07,999 --> 00:52:09,125
Who is it?

322
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:13,880
It's me.

323
00:52:28,895 --> 00:52:30,814
Why do you bother, Madame?

324
00:52:30,897 --> 00:52:33,817
You've gotten your feet all muddy!

325
00:52:34,067 --> 00:52:35,569
There is no need, Madame.

326
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:39,406
Not madame, Susanna.

327
00:52:41,741 --> 00:52:46,621
You are just. I mean...
how will I?

328
00:52:47,706 --> 00:52:50,584
Really. I mean.

329
00:52:52,377 --> 00:52:53,628
Joking!

330
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:58,341
Not right. Who am I to say!

331
00:52:59,718 --> 00:53:03,013
Just as you wish, the next time.

332
00:53:03,305 --> 00:53:08,602
But it's fine, not a bad thing.

333
00:53:09,561 --> 00:53:10,770
I'll try next time.

334
00:53:12,564 --> 00:53:14,065
But how will I?

335
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:21,489
<span style="style.default_1">It is believed that Jesus spent</span>
<span style="style.default_1">his last days in Kashmir.</span>

336
00:53:22,407 --> 00:53:25,952
<span style="style.default_1">Saheb left for Kashmir</span>
<span style="style.default_1">in search of the Lord.</span>

337
00:53:26,494 --> 00:53:30,373
<span style="style.default_1">Instead of Jesus,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">she met "Mohammed".</span>

338
00:53:30,498 --> 00:53:32,709
<span style="style.default_1">Hail Allah!</span>

339
00:53:34,377 --> 00:53:36,796
<span style="style.default_1">Mohammed Wasiullah Khan.</span>

340
00:53:36,963 --> 00:53:38,673
<span style="style.default_1">A.K.A The Traveler.</span>

341
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:42,344
<span style="style.default_1">From the soot of spiraling</span>
<span style="style.default_1">everyday smoke</span>

342
00:53:42,844 --> 00:53:45,805
<span style="style.default_1">a patch of sky, now</span>
<span style="style.default_1">remains blackened</span>

343
00:53:46,806 --> 00:53:49,225
all day long.

344
00:53:49,309 --> 00:53:51,811
-Great!
-Wonderful!

345
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:57,484
Do not bow your head beneath it

346
00:53:57,651 --> 00:54:03,448
for now when you do so,
God yanks His feet away.

347
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:12,082
In the mounds of rotting rubbish

348
00:54:12,248 --> 00:54:14,376
heads of bodies gone
cold still smolder.

349
00:54:14,459 --> 00:54:16,086
<span style="style.default_1">Wonderful! Wonderful!</span>

350
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:22,384
Hungry four legged animals, fight
over the bones of arms and legs.

351
00:54:23,134 --> 00:54:25,720
The flesh and the bone
belongs to the one

352
00:54:25,887 --> 00:54:28,598
who first digs its
teeth into the flesh.

353
00:54:29,849 --> 00:54:31,768
I would like to have
your attention, please.

354
00:54:32,644 --> 00:54:35,897
The flesh and the bone
belongs to the one

355
00:54:36,022 --> 00:54:38,400
who first digs its
teeth into the flesh.

356
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:42,904
The men of faith now ask, who first
dug his spade into this earth!

357
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:51,079
The men of faith now ask, who first
dug his spade into this earth!

358
00:54:51,162 --> 00:54:53,373
Some say there was
a mosque here once.

359
00:54:53,498 --> 00:54:55,834
Some say no,
once a temple stood here.

360
00:55:00,839 --> 00:55:03,008
But when you touch your
forehead to the ground.

361
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:07,971
God yanks His feet away now.

362
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:12,058
He cannot bring Himself to believe.

363
00:55:13,226 --> 00:55:16,021
He cannot bring Himself to believe

364
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:19,357
that He once called
this place, His home.

365
00:55:19,482 --> 00:55:21,234
-Wow!
-Wow!

366
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:25,947
<span style="style.default_1">This time, Saheb not</span>
<span style="style.default_1">only had a new lover</span>

367
00:55:26,072 --> 00:55:29,409
<span style="style.default_1">but also a new name and religion.</span>

368
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:33,496
<span style="style.default_1">Susanna Anna Marie</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Johannes was now.</span>

369
00:55:33,621 --> 00:55:36,416
<span style="style.default_1">Sultana Wasiullah Khan.</span>

370
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:38,001
Thank you.

371
00:55:40,503 --> 00:55:43,673
One more, please!

372
00:55:43,798 --> 00:55:45,300
Don't go!

373
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:47,761
One more verse!

374
00:55:57,771 --> 00:56:00,523
-My next verse.
-Yes, please.

375
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:05,487
A day shall dawn

376
00:56:06,571 --> 00:56:08,615
bringing with it a calm

377
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:14,245
the heart bereft of desires,
the mind devoid of passion.

378
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:20,710
<span style="style.default_1">Shoreless, totally fathomless</span>

379
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:25,965
<span style="style.default_1">Close your eyes, please</span>

380
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:31,638
<span style="style.default_1">I have been drowning</span>

381
00:56:33,139 --> 00:56:36,810
<span style="style.default_1">I need to breathe</span>

382
00:56:38,478 --> 00:56:43,775
<span style="style.default_1">Shoreless, totally fathomless,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Close your eyes, please</span>

383
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:50,073
<span style="style.default_1">I have been drowning,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I need to breathe</span>

384
00:56:50,281 --> 00:56:52,575
<span style="style.default_1">Lillah!</span>

385
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:58,206
<span style="style.default_1">Turn your face away from me</span>

386
00:56:58,331 --> 00:57:03,044
<span style="style.default_1">It'll be a great kindness.</span>

387
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:08,925
<span style="style.default_1">-Turn your face away from me</span>
-Sultana?

388
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:13,805
<span style="style.default_1">It'll be a great kindness</span>

389
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:20,311
<span style="style.default_1">Ever since I saw you</span>

390
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:24,566
<span style="style.default_1">My breath has stopped</span>

391
00:57:24,649 --> 00:57:31,114
<span style="style.default_1">Ever since I saw you</span>

392
00:57:31,197 --> 00:57:35,702
<span style="style.default_1">my breath has stopped</span>

393
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:39,289
<span style="style.default_1">Shoreless, totally fathomless</span>

394
00:57:41,249 --> 00:57:44,961
<span style="style.default_1">Close your eyes, please</span>

395
00:57:46,421 --> 00:57:51,759
<span style="style.default_1">I have been drowning</span>

396
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:56,764
<span style="style.default_1">I need to breathe</span>

397
00:57:57,765 --> 00:57:59,684
-May I?
-Proceed.

398
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:05,648
If a flitting glance of yours,
were to graze me.

399
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:08,109
That would be greeting enough

400
00:58:08,234 --> 00:58:11,154
and I'll keep my
eyes forever lowered.

401
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:12,947
Wow!

402
00:58:14,532 --> 00:58:18,328
Ever since I saw you.

403
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:20,371
My breath has...

404
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:25,877
-Stopped.
-Wow.

405
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:28,254
Encore!

406
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:29,839
Who is that?

407
00:58:31,799 --> 00:58:32,884
Your uncle!

408
00:58:32,967 --> 00:58:37,263
<span style="style.default_1">Pray, take a look</span>

409
00:58:38,056 --> 00:58:42,227
<span style="style.default_1">At your feet</span>

410
00:58:43,394 --> 00:58:47,857
<span style="style.default_1">Something's stuck, it seems</span>

411
00:58:48,733 --> 00:58:53,613
<span style="style.default_1">Please ask Time to move on</span>

412
00:58:54,113 --> 00:58:58,576
<span style="style.default_1">If a flitting glance of yours</span>

413
00:58:59,327 --> 00:59:04,541
<span style="style.default_1">Were to graze me</span>

414
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:08,670
<span style="style.default_1">That would be greeting enough</span>

415
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:15,426
<span style="style.default_1">And I'll keep my</span>
<span style="style.default_1">eyes forever lowered</span>

416
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:22,058
<span style="style.default_1">Ever since I saw you</span>

417
00:59:22,141 --> 00:59:28,022
<span style="style.default_1">my breath has stopped</span>

418
00:59:28,147 --> 00:59:30,692
<span style="style.default_1">Shoreless, totally fathomless</span>

419
00:59:30,858 --> 00:59:33,236
<span style="style.default_1">Close your eyes, please</span>

420
00:59:33,319 --> 00:59:35,822
<span style="style.default_1">I have been drowning</span>

421
00:59:35,947 --> 00:59:38,992
<span style="style.default_1">I need to breathe</span>

422
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:42,078
<span style="style.default_1">Lillah!</span>

423
01:00:00,513 --> 01:00:04,726
<span style="style.default_1">As tender and romantic in his poetry</span>

424
01:00:05,059 --> 01:00:07,979
<span style="style.default_1">as brutal in bed.</span>

425
01:00:13,776 --> 01:00:17,739
<span style="style.default_1">Unless he beat the shit</span>
<span style="style.default_1">out of the woman</span>

426
01:00:17,864 --> 01:00:19,616
<span style="style.default_1">he remained soft.</span>

427
01:00:41,888 --> 01:00:43,973
Come on, bite me.

428
01:00:45,892 --> 01:00:47,644
Come on, bite me.

429
01:00:49,103 --> 01:00:50,980
Come on, let's lose ourselves.

430
01:01:47,995 --> 01:01:53,084
<span style="style.default_1">Initially she tried hard</span>
<span style="style.default_1">to conceal her scars.</span>

431
01:01:53,251 --> 01:01:57,171
<span style="style.default_1">However, her wounds grew deeper.</span>

432
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:02,093
<span style="style.default_1">Love became a myth.</span>

433
01:02:03,136 --> 01:02:09,350
<span style="style.default_1">A mirage. You think it's there,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">but it really isn't.</span>

434
01:02:10,351 --> 01:02:14,856
<span style="style.default_1">Prayers, offerings and sacrifices,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">she tried it all.</span>

435
01:02:14,939 --> 01:02:17,024
<span style="style.default_1">But nothing worked.</span>

436
01:03:54,539 --> 01:03:58,251
Is it coming from the
heart or the being?

437
01:04:43,754 --> 01:04:47,091
These fumes,
from where do they come?

438
01:05:26,672 --> 01:05:30,635
Love is a heavy stone.

439
01:05:34,013 --> 01:05:37,141
Not for the weak ones.

440
01:05:42,146 --> 01:05:43,731
What does 'Natawan' mean?

441
01:06:02,083 --> 01:06:03,834
'Debilitated.'

442
01:06:10,091 --> 01:06:11,384
Weak.

443
01:06:21,310 --> 01:06:22,770
<span style="style.default_1">Feeble.</span>

444
01:07:26,167 --> 01:07:28,294
Sultana!

445
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:36,343
Sultana!

446
01:08:39,740 --> 01:08:41,033
Cold-blooded!

447
01:08:42,535 --> 01:08:44,078
Why kill someone?

448
01:08:45,996 --> 01:08:48,791
She could've left him and come home.

449
01:08:49,333 --> 01:08:50,835
Who would've stopped her?

450
01:08:52,128 --> 01:08:54,713
As a child, Miss Saheb
would walk to school.

451
01:08:56,173 --> 01:08:57,800
There were two paths.

452
01:08:58,926 --> 01:09:00,427
Both equidistant.

453
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:03,389
Neither were different.

454
01:09:05,474 --> 01:09:10,604
And one day, there came a crazy dog,

455
01:09:12,231 --> 01:09:14,233
Who scared her every single day.

456
01:09:28,539 --> 01:09:31,041
She could've taken the other path.

457
01:09:33,335 --> 01:09:39,341
She hid her father's
pistol in her bag.

458
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:42,678
And bang!

459
01:09:46,182 --> 01:09:50,603
Saheb always gets her way.

460
01:09:51,937 --> 01:09:56,317
And the dogs are blown off!

461
01:11:05,469 --> 01:11:06,387
<span style="style.default_1">Namaste</span>

462
01:11:33,622 --> 01:11:35,749
I'm grateful to you.

463
01:11:40,337 --> 01:11:42,172
Then I must be Anna!

464
01:11:54,351 --> 01:11:57,354
In Hindi, please.

465
01:11:58,647 --> 01:12:00,357
I'm learning the language.

466
01:12:07,323 --> 01:12:12,369
What else have you picked up?

467
01:12:20,711 --> 01:12:26,050
My love for you is eternal.

468
01:12:30,304 --> 01:12:31,513
Let's go, Saheb.

469
01:12:41,231 --> 01:12:42,316
Anna.

470
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:52,368
Please have dinner with me

471
01:12:52,534 --> 01:12:57,247
at a nice restaurant tonight.

472
01:13:00,167 --> 01:13:01,794
I am very rich.

473
01:13:34,326 --> 01:13:38,831
Can I at least drop you
to your mansion?

474
01:13:41,291 --> 01:13:45,254
I have my car.

475
01:13:48,132 --> 01:13:50,634
"But I have something better,
a mother."

476
01:13:53,137 --> 01:13:56,765
Amitabh Bachchan.
From the movie, <span style="style.default_1">Deewar.</span>

477
01:14:21,373 --> 01:14:24,376
Goodbye, sweethearts.

478
01:14:39,641 --> 01:14:41,059
From now on...

479
01:14:52,488 --> 01:14:56,742
Russia and me! Why?

480
01:14:58,827 --> 01:15:01,580
Because you, my friend,
are headed to Russia.

481
01:15:01,705 --> 01:15:05,417
To study at St. Petersburg
Medical Academy.

482
01:15:05,542 --> 01:15:07,461
Cheers!

483
01:15:09,087 --> 01:15:10,589
Why?

484
01:15:13,383 --> 01:15:17,137
Because, Nik loves me.

485
01:15:32,319 --> 01:15:34,238
To hell I'm going to Russia!

486
01:15:37,324 --> 01:15:38,659
Why not?

487
01:15:39,952 --> 01:15:43,247
Because, I hate vodka.

488
01:15:48,919 --> 01:15:50,462
It's because...

489
01:16:36,216 --> 01:16:40,804
<span style="style.default_1">Quite a distance he has walked</span>

490
01:16:41,179 --> 01:16:44,725
<span style="style.default_1">A thousand distant miles</span>

491
01:16:44,808 --> 01:16:52,024
<span style="style.default_1">Another Pushkin from Russia</span>

492
01:16:52,107 --> 01:16:59,281
<span style="style.default_1">Who's left Moscow</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Only to be with me</span>

493
01:16:59,448 --> 01:17:05,787
<span style="style.default_1">Something like this is</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Possible only in love</span>

494
01:17:05,871 --> 01:17:07,789
<span style="style.default_1">Darling</span>

495
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:11,168
<span style="style.default_1">Let your eyes feast on mine</span>

496
01:17:11,251 --> 01:17:14,921
<span style="style.default_1">Darling let the passion rush</span>

497
01:17:15,088 --> 01:17:18,925
<span style="style.default_1">Don't hold it</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Back let this love gush</span>

498
01:17:19,051 --> 01:17:22,721
<span style="style.default_1">Darling let</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Your eyes feast on mine</span>

499
01:17:22,846 --> 01:17:26,642
<span style="style.default_1">Don't hold it</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Back let this love gush</span>

500
01:17:26,767 --> 01:17:28,810
<span style="style.default_1">The Spring's joyless</span>

501
01:17:28,935 --> 01:17:30,520
<span style="style.default_1">The beloved's heart's restless</span>

502
01:17:30,646 --> 01:17:34,358
<span style="style.default_1">Hold back the songbirds</span>

503
01:17:34,483 --> 01:17:39,196
<span style="style.default_1">Darling let</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Your eyes feast on mine</span>

504
01:17:56,463 --> 01:17:58,090
Anna?

505
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:06,014
<span style="style.default_1">That hillock enveloped in mist</span>

506
01:18:06,139 --> 01:18:13,105
<span style="style.default_1">Where the fairies once lived</span>

507
01:18:13,313 --> 01:18:20,529
<span style="style.default_1">You'll find it across</span>
<span style="style.default_1">The high Khyber</span>

508
01:18:20,654 --> 01:18:27,077
<span style="style.default_1">That's what all</span>
<span style="style.default_1">The fairies still say</span>

509
01:18:27,160 --> 01:18:29,162
<span style="style.default_1">Darling</span>

510
01:18:29,371 --> 01:18:33,291
<span style="style.default_1">I'm merely a serf,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Let me groom the Princess</span>

511
01:18:33,417 --> 01:18:37,295
<span style="style.default_1">Let this restless heart</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Steal a little solace</span>

512
01:18:37,379 --> 01:18:40,966
<span style="style.default_1">Let me conquer</span>
<span style="style.default_1">The heart of my beloved</span>

513
01:18:41,216 --> 01:18:45,178
<span style="style.default_1">Darling let your</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Eyes feast on mine</span>

514
01:18:45,303 --> 01:18:47,222
<span style="style.default_1">The Spring's joyless</span>

515
01:18:47,305 --> 01:18:48,932
<span style="style.default_1">The beloved's heart's restless</span>

516
01:18:49,015 --> 01:18:52,602
<span style="style.default_1">Hold back the songbirds</span>

517
01:18:52,811 --> 01:18:56,356
<span style="style.default_1">Darling let your</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Eyes feast on mine</span>

518
01:18:56,523 --> 01:19:00,235
<span style="style.default_1">Don't hold it back</span>
<span style="style.default_1">let this love gush.</span>

519
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:03,739
<span style="style.default_1">Darling let your</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Eyes feast on mine</span>

520
01:19:03,864 --> 01:19:07,159
<span style="style.default_1">Don't hold it back</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Let this love gush</span>

521
01:19:07,284 --> 01:19:11,204
<span style="style.default_1">Darling let your</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Eyes feast on mine</span>

522
01:19:15,167 --> 01:19:16,376
Yes.

523
01:20:11,681 --> 01:20:13,767
Who were you talking to, Nik?

524
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:18,855
A colleague, from Moscow.

525
01:20:21,441 --> 01:20:22,984
Woman?

526
01:20:31,868 --> 01:20:33,245
What do you think?

527
01:20:36,873 --> 01:20:40,377
Your last words of the
conversation meant...

528
01:20:41,211 --> 01:20:43,922
"Darling, I will be back soon."

529
01:20:59,437 --> 01:21:01,773
You are hiding something
from me, Nik.

530
01:21:15,287 --> 01:21:21,501
When I say I go to Kanyakumari.

531
01:21:24,796 --> 01:21:29,593
I don't go to Kanyakumari.

532
01:21:33,388 --> 01:21:36,308
I go to Koodankulam, instead.

533
01:21:41,271 --> 01:21:42,647
Koodankulam?

534
01:21:44,524 --> 01:21:45,942
Yes, Koodankulam.

535
01:22:10,467 --> 01:22:11,927
What's that supposed to mean?

536
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:26,608
Nik.

537
01:22:30,111 --> 01:22:31,446
You are a spy?

538
01:22:33,490 --> 01:22:35,116
Come on!

539
01:22:41,623 --> 01:22:43,083
No.

540
01:22:48,296 --> 01:22:49,297
No!

541
01:22:52,467 --> 01:22:54,052
I am your friend.

542
01:22:55,220 --> 01:22:56,846
And...

543
01:22:59,182 --> 01:23:03,561
my love for you is eternal.

544
01:23:14,489 --> 01:23:16,032
A kilo of this, please.

545
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:19,786
I'm just not ready for
another marriage.

546
01:23:23,999 --> 01:23:25,250
Why not?

547
01:23:26,543 --> 01:23:30,338
Marriage is the worst thing
that happened to mankind.

548
01:24:04,873 --> 01:24:10,045
I'm pregnant...

549
01:24:11,046 --> 01:24:13,965
with your child.

550
01:24:16,009 --> 01:24:17,385
<span style="style.default_1">A shocking incident.</span>

551
01:24:17,469 --> 01:24:20,388
<span style="style.default_1">India had finally accomplished</span>
<span style="style.default_1">its nuclear test.</span>

552
01:24:21,473 --> 01:24:24,517
<span style="style.default_1">And instead of Hiroshima,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">it was now, my heart!</span>

553
01:24:25,977 --> 01:24:28,354
<span style="style.default_1">Saheb dropped two bombs.</span>

554
01:24:28,855 --> 01:24:30,690
<span style="style.default_1">First, to get married!</span>

555
01:24:35,278 --> 01:24:38,531
<span style="style.default_1">The other, to send me to Russia.</span>

556
01:25:05,850 --> 01:25:07,936
<span style="style.default_1">It was my fault.</span>

557
01:25:09,437 --> 01:25:11,981
<span style="style.default_1">I should've kept mum.</span>

558
01:25:13,858 --> 01:25:16,236
<span style="style.default_1">I made a trip to Moscow to</span>
<span style="style.default_1">attend a college seminar.</span>

559
01:25:17,654 --> 01:25:20,198
<span style="style.default_1">And what I saw there...</span>

560
01:25:20,907 --> 01:25:23,243
<span style="style.default_1">blew my mind.</span>

561
01:25:27,455 --> 01:25:30,834
<span style="style.default_1">Nikolai Vronsky, in fact had</span>

562
01:25:30,959 --> 01:25:32,669
<span style="style.default_1">two Annas.</span>

563
01:25:34,504 --> 01:25:37,924
<span style="style.default_1">One in India and</span>
<span style="style.default_1">the other in Moscow.</span>

564
01:25:40,844 --> 01:25:44,097
<span style="style.default_1">I still blame myself for his death.</span>

565
01:25:44,973 --> 01:25:48,268
<span style="style.default_1">I shouldn't have sent</span>
<span style="style.default_1">her those pictures.</span>

566
01:25:58,236 --> 01:25:59,487
Where's Anna?

567
01:26:03,825 --> 01:26:05,160
She's at the market.

568
01:26:05,493 --> 01:26:08,037
-But why?
-For her new wedding gown.

569
01:26:23,553 --> 01:26:25,805
Goonga! Great job.

570
01:26:25,930 --> 01:26:27,849
Lovely!

571
01:26:28,766 --> 01:26:30,685
Feels so good.

572
01:26:31,895 --> 01:26:33,813
The late Major,

573
01:26:35,607 --> 01:26:37,483
her first husband.

574
01:26:42,947 --> 01:26:47,285
He was eaten by a panther,
wasn't he?

575
01:26:49,746 --> 01:26:51,331
Shut up Goonga!

576
01:26:53,875 --> 01:26:56,544
He says we pushed the Major down.

577
01:27:01,674 --> 01:27:04,135
Don't believe him, sir.

578
01:27:04,260 --> 01:27:06,095
He is a big liar.

579
01:27:22,612 --> 01:27:24,447
Goonga, shut the hell up.

580
01:27:25,657 --> 01:27:28,368
Why are you telling me all this?

581
01:27:28,451 --> 01:27:30,954
Because he too, had a mother.

582
01:27:31,162 --> 01:27:32,914
No, not at all.

583
01:27:33,414 --> 01:27:36,334
Don't believe them,
they are just lying!

584
01:27:37,126 --> 01:27:44,133
They say, that we gave him
an overdose of heroin.

585
01:27:55,061 --> 01:27:57,272
Husband number three.

586
01:27:58,314 --> 01:28:02,694
Wasiullah Khan a.k.a The Traveler!

587
01:28:03,403 --> 01:28:05,738
We dug his grave in the snow

588
01:28:06,489 --> 01:28:10,493
and buried him alive.

589
01:28:23,673 --> 01:28:25,133
Where is Anna?

590
01:28:28,928 --> 01:28:31,639
Anna is over here!

591
01:28:32,140 --> 01:28:33,516
Look!

592
01:28:33,599 --> 01:28:36,060
Anna's here!

593
01:28:38,813 --> 01:28:41,316
And that is you,

594
01:28:42,358 --> 01:28:44,402
Nikolai Vronsky!

595
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:49,907
My husband number four

596
01:28:50,408 --> 01:28:54,746
with his wife number two.

597
01:28:55,747 --> 01:28:58,416
Cheers to that!

598
01:28:58,708 --> 01:29:05,048
Four, four...

599
01:29:08,176 --> 01:29:09,427
R. A. W.

600
01:29:11,596 --> 01:29:15,641
R. A. W...

601
01:29:31,449 --> 01:29:33,534
A wife in every country!

602
01:29:33,618 --> 01:29:36,788
<span style="style.default_1">Darling let your eyes feast on mine</span>

603
01:29:36,954 --> 01:29:39,874
<span style="style.default_1">Darling let your eyes feast on mine</span>

604
01:29:42,376 --> 01:29:45,296
Run away! Run fast!

605
01:29:49,592 --> 01:29:51,302
He ran away!

606
01:30:14,200 --> 01:30:18,079
Believe me, we were just acting
like husband and wife.

607
01:30:20,665 --> 01:30:26,129
I know you can play
a very good husband!

608
01:30:30,216 --> 01:30:33,845
But to play such a great daddy.

609
01:31:35,531 --> 01:31:37,700
My love for you is eternal.

610
01:32:03,226 --> 01:32:05,561
Come on, you've been called.

611
01:32:10,483 --> 01:32:14,820
There she is.

612
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:25,623
Have a seat, please.

613
01:32:33,547 --> 01:32:35,758
How're you doing, madame?

614
01:32:39,303 --> 01:32:41,931
-It's you.
-Yes, it's me, Keemat.

615
01:32:43,808 --> 01:32:46,185
Inspector Keemat Lal!

616
01:32:53,943 --> 01:32:56,070
This time, you're in real trouble.

617
01:32:57,780 --> 01:32:59,949
-Look, Mr. Keemat.
-No 'Mr.' please.

618
01:33:00,700 --> 01:33:02,368
Just Keemat.

619
01:33:03,077 --> 01:33:04,996
I've gone through all your reports.

620
01:33:06,330 --> 01:33:11,419
The local police is convinced
about your involvement.

621
01:33:13,879 --> 01:33:16,757
According to them it's a
clear cut case of murder.

622
01:33:18,092 --> 01:33:21,053
But the case is sensitive.

623
01:33:21,595 --> 01:33:25,725
The Ministry of external affairs,
Russian embassy, are all involved.

624
01:33:27,226 --> 01:33:29,687
You are an intelligent woman.

625
01:33:31,689 --> 01:33:33,649
But, this time...

626
01:33:41,073 --> 01:33:45,786
there is a certain item missing
from your husband's belongings.

627
01:33:50,666 --> 01:33:56,172
If only I could
get my hands on that.

628
01:34:00,676 --> 01:34:02,345
You get it?

629
01:34:41,759 --> 01:34:44,845
That's it!
Just leave the rest to me.

630
01:34:45,846 --> 01:34:47,473
Great!

631
01:34:51,477 --> 01:34:57,233
By the way, what are you doing
this evening? Must be busy.

632
01:34:57,400 --> 01:35:00,653
I need to inspect the
scene of the crime.

633
01:35:02,571 --> 01:35:06,492
Maybe, some other time then.

634
01:35:09,912 --> 01:35:12,123
Do you prefer vegetarian
or non vegetarian?

635
01:35:14,834 --> 01:35:16,627
Don't bother.

636
01:35:17,878 --> 01:35:19,672
Non vegetarian.

637
01:35:22,508 --> 01:35:26,137
And what would you prefer to drink?

638
01:35:30,057 --> 01:35:31,809
Nothing in particular.

639
01:35:35,479 --> 01:35:37,022
What do you prefer?

640
01:35:39,024 --> 01:35:42,027
Anything but vodka.

641
01:35:46,157 --> 01:35:49,368
You're going to get me killed,
madame.

642
01:35:50,911 --> 01:35:53,706
Sorry, Sunaina.

643
01:36:00,963 --> 01:36:02,089
Wow!

644
01:36:06,302 --> 01:36:09,430
I think I've had a bit
too much to drink.

645
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:14,101
Never mind.

646
01:36:14,894 --> 01:36:17,605
You'll sweat it out.

647
01:36:18,856 --> 01:36:19,982
Where?

648
01:36:20,441 --> 01:36:23,736
At the scene of the crime.

649
01:36:32,244 --> 01:36:34,413
It is pretty deep.

650
01:36:35,706 --> 01:36:40,169
In the dark anyone could
miss his step.

651
01:36:42,588 --> 01:36:46,091
It was a full moon night.

652
01:36:48,010 --> 01:36:49,720
Mind you, he didn't slip.

653
01:36:50,846 --> 01:36:52,306
He climbed down

654
01:36:53,015 --> 01:36:55,184
on his own.

655
01:36:59,980 --> 01:37:03,692
Must've been slippery
because of the rain...

656
01:37:05,361 --> 01:37:09,406
and moss.

657
01:37:11,534 --> 01:37:12,910
The rain?

658
01:37:13,369 --> 01:37:15,079
In this season?

659
01:37:28,467 --> 01:37:31,762
A lot of accidents can happen
when one is drunk.

660
01:37:36,308 --> 01:37:38,435
He had quit drinking.

661
01:37:49,321 --> 01:37:50,698
Alcohol!

662
01:37:53,909 --> 01:37:59,331
How do I...

663
01:38:00,165 --> 01:38:01,750
What should I say?

664
01:38:05,963 --> 01:38:07,381
Forget about it.

665
01:38:10,801 --> 01:38:12,303
Sorry?

666
01:38:16,932 --> 01:38:18,142
Madame!

667
01:38:21,770 --> 01:38:23,230
Darkness!

668
01:38:23,939 --> 01:38:26,650
Pitch black!

669
01:38:27,443 --> 01:38:32,615
Raining...

670
01:38:33,490 --> 01:38:38,078
cats and dogs!

671
01:38:41,498 --> 01:38:42,583
And...

672
01:38:42,708 --> 01:38:47,671
the white man slipped.

673
01:38:48,172 --> 01:38:49,798
Died!

674
01:38:49,965 --> 01:38:53,010
Reached hell.
The bastard deserved it!

675
01:38:54,553 --> 01:38:56,347
Madame!

676
01:39:26,043 --> 01:39:28,879
I'll never forget this favor.

677
01:39:31,048 --> 01:39:33,467
'Pure satisfaction.'

678
01:39:35,094 --> 01:39:38,472
Like I've bathed a hundred
times in the holy waters.

679
01:39:40,557 --> 01:39:42,810
No need to worry anymore.

680
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:46,480
If you ever come to Delhi...

681
01:39:47,356 --> 01:39:49,274
I'd like to return the favor.

682
01:39:55,155 --> 01:39:56,407
Should I go?

683
01:39:57,533 --> 01:39:58,659
Yes!

684
01:40:09,837 --> 01:40:14,466
<span style="style.default_1">Keemat left, only to return sooner.</span>

685
01:40:15,175 --> 01:40:17,052
<span style="style.default_1">He definitely reached Delhi</span>

686
01:40:17,261 --> 01:40:20,639
<span style="style.default_1">but left his heart behind.</span>

687
01:40:20,764 --> 01:40:23,809
<span style="style.default_1">He'd come back for it every time</span>

688
01:40:23,892 --> 01:40:26,854
<span style="style.default_1">but always managed</span>
<span style="style.default_1">to leave it behind.</span>

689
01:40:28,063 --> 01:40:29,565
Come Madame.

690
01:40:29,690 --> 01:40:30,941
Come.

691
01:41:17,696 --> 01:41:21,366
<span style="style.default_1">But Keemat kept on coming.</span>

692
01:41:22,367 --> 01:41:25,078
<span style="style.default_1">Saheb was left</span>
<span style="style.default_1">with no other option.</span>

693
01:41:29,583 --> 01:41:35,297
<span style="style.default_1">His quest for 'pure satisfaction'</span>
<span style="style.default_1">knew no end.</span>

694
01:41:47,601 --> 01:41:51,396
I confessed to my wife.

695
01:41:54,525 --> 01:41:55,943
Why?

696
01:41:59,780 --> 01:42:01,698
I wanted a divorce.

697
01:42:08,497 --> 01:42:09,957
And I got it too!

698
01:42:11,291 --> 01:42:12,876
Here, look!

699
01:42:19,258 --> 01:42:22,761
I can't live without you anymore.

700
01:42:24,012 --> 01:42:25,973
I'd rather die.

701
01:42:26,098 --> 01:42:29,351
I will die.

702
01:42:32,813 --> 01:42:35,983
I swear on the Lord himself!

703
01:44:33,392 --> 01:44:36,645
Oh my God. There was poison
in the Viagra bottle?

704
01:44:37,229 --> 01:44:39,690
The bottle contained Viagra pills.

705
01:44:40,148 --> 01:44:41,441
What was it then?

706
01:44:52,160 --> 01:44:55,747
Accident? She killed him.
And you knew it.

707
01:44:55,872 --> 01:44:57,457
How would I know?

708
01:44:57,958 --> 01:45:01,461
Of course, you wouldn't. You
were blinded by her love.

709
01:45:04,047 --> 01:45:08,552
Some years later, I returned
from Russia, a Doctor.

710
01:45:09,428 --> 01:45:14,266
But Saheb had turned into
'a patient.'

711
01:45:22,774 --> 01:45:26,737
What has the world done
to my little bunny!

712
01:45:45,047 --> 01:45:46,840
What are you looking for?

713
01:45:49,968 --> 01:45:51,344
I know there's one

714
01:45:52,596 --> 01:45:54,056
hiding somewhere.

715
01:45:56,892 --> 01:46:01,438
I just can't seem to find
the rascal, when I want.

716
01:46:02,355 --> 01:46:03,899
White hair?

717
01:46:06,443 --> 01:46:08,028
Don't say it aloud.

718
01:46:09,071 --> 01:46:10,906
It's a bad omen.

719
01:46:19,039 --> 01:46:20,874
Here it is.

720
01:46:21,708 --> 01:46:23,502
Show it. Let me see!

721
01:46:25,378 --> 01:46:26,880
Fetch the scissors.

722
01:46:27,047 --> 01:46:28,465
There on the record.

723
01:46:36,056 --> 01:46:37,933
Snip it at the root.

724
01:46:46,316 --> 01:46:47,734
See?

725
01:46:48,401 --> 01:46:50,821
How much I need you.

726
01:46:54,825 --> 01:46:58,161
Right there. Put it in the box.

727
01:47:05,252 --> 01:47:09,756
I hate New Year's Eve.

728
01:47:14,845 --> 01:47:17,347
When did you see me last?

729
01:47:19,015 --> 01:47:20,600
It's been two years.

730
01:47:24,521 --> 01:47:26,606
Do I look any different?

731
01:47:31,319 --> 01:47:34,781
You've become
a little more beautiful.

732
01:47:48,670 --> 01:47:50,422
I haven't changed at all?

733
01:48:04,227 --> 01:48:05,562
Sure?

734
01:48:13,612 --> 01:48:16,114
You've grown up to be shy.

735
01:48:26,333 --> 01:48:27,792
Please don't, Saheb.

736
01:48:28,126 --> 01:48:29,419
Why not?

737
01:48:31,004 --> 01:48:34,216
It's my responsibility
to educate you.

738
01:49:03,536 --> 01:49:09,000
<span style="style.default_1">The delicate thread between</span>
<span style="style.default_1">us had snapped.</span>

739
01:49:10,543 --> 01:49:14,881
<span style="style.default_1">That was the last time</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I ever saw her.</span>

740
01:49:17,884 --> 01:49:19,261
<span style="style.default_1">The next morning</span>

741
01:49:19,386 --> 01:49:24,683
<span style="style.default_1">I took Goonga along</span>
<span style="style.default_1">and left her forever.</span>

742
01:50:03,430 --> 01:50:06,850
No one to fear, and no
favors to be returned.

743
01:50:11,479 --> 01:50:12,981
You still miss her, right?

744
01:50:18,028 --> 01:50:20,697
Get some sleep. It's pretty late.

745
01:50:21,573 --> 01:50:24,534
It's an early morning flight
and you need to be in time

746
01:50:24,617 --> 01:50:26,536
for security check.

747
01:52:26,239 --> 01:52:27,782
Hello!

748
01:53:09,908 --> 01:53:14,746
We'll find out right now, details
about his last call.

749
01:53:15,747 --> 01:53:17,832
Please calm down.

750
01:53:17,957 --> 01:53:20,585
Here, have some water.

751
01:53:23,171 --> 01:53:25,381
I told him you are very angry.

752
01:53:25,757 --> 01:53:27,258
Hand me the phone.

753
01:53:41,606 --> 01:53:45,610
I tried calling you a hundred times.
There is no conference in Delhi.

754
01:53:46,486 --> 01:53:47,862
Arun!

755
01:53:51,157 --> 01:53:53,535
Nandini, I'm fine wherever I am.

756
01:53:54,577 --> 01:53:56,704
I'll be back in a day or two.

757
01:54:03,086 --> 01:54:04,796
For what?

758
01:54:11,928 --> 01:54:15,598
<span style="style.default_1">I can't believe you would</span>
<span style="style.default_1">betray me for anyone.</span>

759
01:54:19,018 --> 01:54:20,478
But there is someone.

760
01:54:21,938 --> 01:54:23,314
Is she alive?

761
01:54:24,524 --> 01:54:26,109
Arun?

762
01:54:27,026 --> 01:54:29,070
Is Susanna alive?

763
01:55:03,688 --> 01:55:06,190
Do you need more time
to think over it?

764
01:55:09,611 --> 01:55:13,239
No. I've already made my decision.

765
01:55:13,907 --> 01:55:15,533
Alright then.

766
01:55:15,909 --> 01:55:19,037
See you in the church at 11.

767
01:55:53,571 --> 01:55:56,407
I've repaid your favors, Saheb.

768
01:56:09,087 --> 01:56:11,756
Your Saheb is no more.

769
01:56:21,557 --> 01:56:26,604
<span style="style.default_1">I kept looking for reasons to</span>
<span style="style.default_1">live, after you were gone.</span>

770
01:56:27,105 --> 01:56:30,358
<span style="style.default_1">And one day, I heard</span>
<span style="style.default_1">about your wedding.</span>

771
01:56:30,566 --> 01:56:33,528
<span style="style.default_1">What better reason could</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I have waited for</span>

772
01:56:33,736 --> 01:56:35,488
<span style="style.default_1">to end my life.</span>

773
01:56:56,884 --> 01:56:59,387
The phone and car, are
both out of order.

774
01:56:59,554 --> 01:57:02,390
My mistress needs to
get to the hospital.

775
01:57:02,515 --> 01:57:05,518
Please, sir, for God's sake.

776
01:57:05,601 --> 01:57:09,022
Please help, sir. Please!

777
01:57:09,605 --> 01:57:12,316
Otherwise my mistress will die.

778
01:57:15,862 --> 01:57:21,659
<span style="style.default_1">I was desperate to finally</span>
<span style="style.default_1">rest in the arms of Jesus.</span>

779
01:57:21,951 --> 01:57:24,412
<span style="style.default_1">Looks like Jesus changed his mind.</span>

780
01:57:26,622 --> 01:57:31,878
<span style="style.default_1">Maybe in guilt,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">he sent me an angel.</span>

781
01:57:36,799 --> 01:57:39,385
<span style="style.default_1">I was dead in my head.</span>

782
01:57:39,969 --> 01:57:43,389
<span style="style.default_1">But when I woke up, felt</span>
<span style="style.default_1">a little strange.</span>

783
01:57:43,598 --> 01:57:46,100
<span style="style.default_1">A pair of spectacles</span>
<span style="style.default_1">on God's nose?</span>

784
01:57:50,104 --> 01:57:51,272
You are...

785
01:57:51,689 --> 01:57:53,149
Tarafdar.

786
01:57:54,901 --> 01:57:58,571
<span style="style.default_1">Dr. Modhushudhon Tarafdar.</span>

787
01:57:58,696 --> 01:58:02,450
<span style="style.default_1">Who slowly became the big</span>
<span style="style.default_1">brother of the house.</span>

788
01:58:02,575 --> 01:58:05,536
<span style="style.default_1">He was considered some</span>
<span style="style.default_1">kind of Miracle Doctor.</span>

789
01:58:06,079 --> 01:58:08,456
<span style="style.default_1">A strange concoction of allopathy,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">naturopathy</span>

790
01:58:08,581 --> 01:58:11,834
<span style="style.default_1">Ayurveda and spirituality.</span>

791
01:58:34,774 --> 01:58:36,776
Ridiculous!

792
01:58:42,156 --> 01:58:46,119
This mushroom is called
Jack O' Lantern.

793
01:58:49,205 --> 01:58:52,750
It has a number of uses.

794
01:58:54,752 --> 01:58:56,546
Very useful mushroom.

795
01:59:00,299 --> 01:59:05,304
A bit could cure,
too much could kill.

796
01:59:06,848 --> 01:59:09,142
There is plenty of evil all around.

797
01:59:12,520 --> 01:59:14,856
There is plenty of evil all around.

798
01:59:14,981 --> 01:59:18,818
And even plenty is never
really enough.

799
01:59:20,236 --> 01:59:22,280
It's always scarce.

800
01:59:25,408 --> 01:59:28,411
But for the one who survives
even in scarcity,

801
01:59:29,453 --> 01:59:31,956
nothing seems scarce.

802
01:59:32,665 --> 01:59:35,960
Less, more, more,
less, that's life.

803
01:59:40,006 --> 01:59:45,761
So would you prefer less
or more in your soup?

804
01:59:48,556 --> 01:59:54,770
<span style="style.default_1">For a healer like him, I was willing</span>
<span style="style.default_1">to remain ill all my life.</span>

805
01:59:55,271 --> 01:59:58,900
<span style="style.default_1">And I would've but Modhu promised,</span>

806
01:59:58,983 --> 02:00:02,945
<span style="style.default_1">he wouldn't go back to Calcutta.</span>

807
02:00:03,696 --> 02:00:06,115
<span style="style.default_1">Marriage wasn't on my mind.</span>

808
02:00:06,240 --> 02:00:11,412
<span style="style.default_1">But Modhu wanted me to be</span>
<span style="style.default_1">the heir to his wealth.</span>

809
02:00:11,537 --> 02:00:15,917
<span style="style.default_1">He was afraid that if he were</span>
<span style="style.default_1">to leave this world before me,</span>

810
02:00:16,042 --> 02:00:21,923
<span style="style.default_1">then his ex-wife and daughter</span>
<span style="style.default_1">would harass me.</span>

811
02:00:33,351 --> 02:00:35,686
<span style="style.default_1">My life was grounded</span>

812
02:00:35,811 --> 02:00:38,648
<span style="style.default_1">but I was flying.</span>

813
02:00:38,773 --> 02:00:40,608
Modhu.

814
02:01:17,019 --> 02:01:18,437
Khan!

815
02:01:19,105 --> 02:01:21,023
What happened to the lights?

816
02:01:38,291 --> 02:01:41,043
Khan! Maggie aunty!

817
02:01:42,503 --> 02:01:44,630
There's a robber upstairs.
And he has a knife.

818
02:01:44,755 --> 02:01:46,340
Be careful!

819
02:02:05,943 --> 02:02:10,406
<span style="style.default_1">News is just in that in shootout</span>
<span style="style.default_1">at the Taj hotel.</span>

820
02:02:10,740 --> 02:02:13,993
<span style="style.default_1">NSE Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan</span>
<span style="style.default_1">has been killed.</span>

821
02:02:14,118 --> 02:02:17,371
<span style="style.default_1">At the Trident Oberoi</span>
<span style="style.default_1">and Nariman House...</span>

822
02:02:23,919 --> 02:02:25,671
Don't worry!

823
02:02:25,796 --> 02:02:28,215
Everything will be fine, come.

824
02:02:36,307 --> 02:02:37,933
Modhu.

825
02:02:38,851 --> 02:02:39,810
Towel.

826
02:02:39,935 --> 02:02:42,438
-Thank you.
-Let me see?

827
02:03:13,761 --> 02:03:18,974
<span style="style.default_1">I was destined to be with</span>
<span style="style.default_1">all the wrong men.</span>

828
02:03:22,395 --> 02:03:25,314
<span style="style.default_1">At first I was completely shattered!</span>

829
02:03:25,439 --> 02:03:28,984
<span style="style.default_1">But slowly I began to fear him.</span>

830
02:03:29,110 --> 02:03:32,738
<span style="style.default_1">For the first time, it was</span>
<span style="style.default_1">my life that was in danger.</span>

831
02:03:37,993 --> 02:03:42,039
Look what I cooked
especially for you.

832
02:06:47,433 --> 02:06:50,686
How can you think such a thing?
Have you lost it?

833
02:07:03,699 --> 02:07:07,369
What are you doing?

834
02:07:12,041 --> 02:07:13,417
Susanna, look.

835
02:07:24,595 --> 02:07:28,515
This is a big misunderstanding,
Susanna. And, even if it isn't...

836
02:07:40,402 --> 02:07:44,990
Please, darling,
please listen to me.

837
02:08:21,735 --> 02:08:23,320
It's your turn.

838
02:08:41,255 --> 02:08:43,757
I really needed it.

839
02:08:43,882 --> 02:08:45,884
I lost a lot of money in business.

840
02:09:38,645 --> 02:09:41,815
I truly love you Susanna,
believe me.

841
02:10:02,711 --> 02:10:06,799
<span style="style.default_1">I wasn't even destined</span>
<span style="style.default_1">for a peaceful death.</span>

842
02:10:06,965 --> 02:10:11,428
<span style="style.default_1">I had forgotten all the bullets,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">next to Tarafdar's body.</span>

843
02:10:19,561 --> 02:10:23,065
<span style="style.default_1">Sleeping pills had failed once.</span>

844
02:10:24,149 --> 02:10:27,528
<span style="style.default_1">I didn't want</span>
<span style="style.default_1">to hang on a noose.</span>

845
02:12:37,115 --> 02:12:41,620
<span style="style.default_1">I'd lost respect for myself.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I was shattered.</span>

846
02:12:42,120 --> 02:12:47,292
<span style="style.default_1">For a professional swimmer</span>
<span style="style.default_1">drowning isn't an option.</span>

847
02:12:54,925 --> 02:12:59,346
<span style="style.default_1">I was punishing myself</span>
<span style="style.default_1">for my cowardice.</span>

848
02:12:59,638 --> 02:13:02,724
<span style="style.default_1">A new death every moment.</span>

849
02:13:07,270 --> 02:13:09,314
<span style="style.default_1">And then I found out</span>

850
02:13:09,439 --> 02:13:11,358
<span style="style.default_1">I was dead for the rest of world.</span>

851
02:13:17,990 --> 02:13:23,120
<span style="style.default_1">I couldn't let Maggie's</span>
<span style="style.default_1">sacrifice go in vain.</span>

852
02:13:23,286 --> 02:13:26,206
<span style="style.default_1">She forced me to take</span>
<span style="style.default_1">on life,</span>

853
02:13:26,289 --> 02:13:30,752
<span style="style.default_1">one last time.</span>

854
02:13:34,673 --> 02:13:38,051
<span style="style.default_1">Of course, you were forced</span>
<span style="style.default_1">into everything</span>

855
02:13:38,176 --> 02:13:43,640
into marriage, into murders!

856
02:13:45,475 --> 02:13:51,398
Did you ever stop to wonder, why
you committed all those sins?

857
02:13:51,523 --> 02:13:52,899
For whom?

858
02:13:56,236 --> 02:13:58,989
For my heart!

859
02:13:59,614 --> 02:14:01,158
Your heart.

860
02:14:01,283 --> 02:14:05,871
-The heart!
-The heart!

861
02:14:05,954 --> 02:14:07,956
For the sake of your heart

862
02:14:08,040 --> 02:14:11,376
you sent six people to their

863
02:14:11,668 --> 02:14:14,379
final abode before their time.

864
02:14:17,215 --> 02:14:20,635
You won't understand, sugar.

865
02:14:23,555 --> 02:14:24,848
Here's a little fact.

866
02:14:25,057 --> 02:14:28,226
Every single wife

867
02:14:28,351 --> 02:14:32,105
has at least once in her
life entertained

868
02:14:32,230 --> 02:14:37,819
the thought of getting
rid of her husband.

869
02:14:38,403 --> 02:14:39,780
Why don't you ask your wife?

870
02:14:39,863 --> 02:14:44,034
I'm sure she's thought
of at least one way

871
02:14:44,159 --> 02:14:46,244
to murder you.

872
02:14:51,750 --> 02:14:55,462
Any idea why you've survived?

873
02:15:00,092 --> 02:15:01,551
A child makes

874
02:15:01,635 --> 02:15:08,642
the husband more acceptable.

875
02:15:14,481 --> 02:15:18,276
<span style="style.default_1">That's the reason why</span>
<span style="style.default_1">you never had a child!</span>

876
02:15:21,613 --> 02:15:27,077
You fulfilled that desire of mine.

877
02:15:30,455 --> 02:15:35,252
Never have I shared our
love with anyone,

878
02:15:36,336 --> 02:15:38,296
nor will I ever in the future.

879
02:15:38,839 --> 02:15:40,674
In the future?

880
02:15:43,468 --> 02:15:46,304
Now you won't find a sacrificial
lamb, Saheb.

881
02:15:47,222 --> 02:15:49,724
Your beauty...

882
02:15:53,603 --> 02:15:55,939
You've become a little scary.

883
02:16:10,287 --> 02:16:14,875
He has accepted me for
the person I am

884
02:16:15,625 --> 02:16:19,379
with all my sins and virtues
and this scary...

885
02:16:19,462 --> 02:16:24,426
scary face of mine.

886
02:16:25,969 --> 02:16:27,429
Who?

887
02:16:29,472 --> 02:16:31,808
My seventh husband.

888
02:16:43,570 --> 02:16:48,617
There's a beautiful church,
in the old city.

889
02:16:51,828 --> 02:16:53,330
Will you come?

890
02:16:54,539 --> 02:16:58,418
Tomorrow morning. Eleven o'clock.

891
02:17:07,969 --> 02:17:11,806
I won't let you take
another life, Saheb.

892
02:17:19,522 --> 02:17:21,399
Hey sugar!

893
02:17:22,275 --> 02:17:25,195
You won't be able to save him.

894
02:17:28,240 --> 02:17:31,910
He has already sacrificed
himself for love.

895
02:18:37,183 --> 02:18:42,731
The world, the universe
and its radiance

896
02:18:42,939 --> 02:18:45,734
aren't enough to satisfy my soul.

897
02:18:46,401 --> 02:18:50,322
This peace, this joy, can be attained,

898
02:18:50,405 --> 02:18:53,908
only through Jesus Christ.

899
02:18:54,826 --> 02:18:56,786
Who is very dear to me.

900
02:18:58,330 --> 02:19:00,206
The Lord of the Universe.

901
02:19:01,833 --> 02:19:05,670
I, Sister Anna...

902
02:19:06,755 --> 02:19:09,049
in the presence of Mother Mary

903
02:19:09,549 --> 02:19:13,094
solemnly vow to Lord Jesus

904
02:19:13,511 --> 02:19:17,515
that from now on I belong to Him alone.

905
02:19:20,101 --> 02:19:24,606
From today He is my only master...

906
02:19:26,232 --> 02:19:27,776
my spouse.

907
02:19:44,793 --> 02:19:51,800
<span style="style.default_1">There is not a soul in sight now</span>

908
02:19:53,343 --> 02:20:00,141
<span style="style.default_1">Come, acknowledge me now, at least</span>

909
02:20:01,559 --> 02:20:08,358
<span style="style.default_1">Not a soul stirs this moment</span>

910
02:20:10,068 --> 02:20:16,574
<span style="style.default_1">Come, embrace me in your fold</span>

911
02:20:18,618 --> 02:20:24,707
<span style="style.default_1">Embrace me just this once</span>

912
02:20:24,833 --> 02:20:30,505
<span style="style.default_1">Then take me along</span>

913
02:20:31,214 --> 02:20:35,218
<span style="style.default_1">Hope there is no misery</span>

914
02:20:35,301 --> 02:20:39,180
<span style="style.default_1">On the other side</span>

915
02:20:40,390 --> 02:20:44,352
<span style="style.default_1">Jesus</span>

916
02:20:44,477 --> 02:20:47,856
<span style="style.default_1">Jesus</span>

917
02:20:47,981 --> 02:20:52,610
<span style="style.default_1">You hear the tolling</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Of the church bells</span>

918
02:20:52,694 --> 02:20:56,197
<span style="style.default_1">Jesus</span>

919
02:20:56,531 --> 02:21:01,077
<span style="style.default_1">Yet all you choose is</span>
<span style="style.default_1">To keep your quiet</span>

920
02:21:01,161 --> 02:21:04,873
<span style="style.default_1">Jesus.</span>

921
02:21:05,081 --> 02:21:12,755
<span style="style.default_1">How do you pick who amongst</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Us is worthy of your grace</span>

922
02:21:13,923 --> 02:21:17,385
<span style="style.default_1">Jesus.</span>

923
02:21:17,469 --> 02:21:21,931
<span style="style.default_1">You hear the tolling</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Of the church bells</span>

924
02:21:22,056 --> 02:21:24,559
<span style="style.default_1">Jesus</span>

925
02:21:25,894 --> 02:21:30,523
<span style="style.default_1">Yet all you choose is</span>
<span style="style.default_1">to keep your quiet</span>

926
02:21:30,648 --> 02:21:33,443
<span style="style.default_1">Jesus</span>

927
02:21:45,246 --> 02:21:48,249
I want to confess my sins, Father!

928
02:21:50,919 --> 02:21:52,837
My seven sins.

929
02:22:19,948 --> 02:22:21,241
Arun! Arun!

930
02:22:21,324 --> 02:22:24,285
Stop the car! Right now!

931
02:22:28,081 --> 02:22:30,667
Arun! Arun!

932
02:22:57,986 --> 02:22:59,445
Did you say anything to the police?

933
02:22:59,571 --> 02:23:01,573
I haven't told them the truth yet.

934
02:23:01,698 --> 02:23:04,033
Or you'd be in jail for
the rest of your life.

935
02:23:04,576 --> 02:23:06,411
If you ever...

936
02:23:06,911 --> 02:23:09,122
try to see her again

937
02:23:28,683 --> 02:23:30,602
What happened to your spectacles?

938
02:23:33,313 --> 02:23:35,189
Someone cast an evil eye.
