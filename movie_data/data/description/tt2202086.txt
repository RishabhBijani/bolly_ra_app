Home Minister Janardhan Jagirdarand chief Minister Anna Saheb are much concerned over the criminal activities of underworld dons Rawal and Rauf Lala. Rawal is operating from Bangkok while Rauf supervises his gang from Mumbai. The famous Encounter Squad is activated to counter the gangsters and restore peace in the area. The formidable Sadhu Agashe (Nana Patekar) is requested to take charge of the peace-keeping mission. At first he is reluctant but after continuous insistence, he agrees to launch a counter attack against Rawal and Lala Rauf gangs and the action begins.
